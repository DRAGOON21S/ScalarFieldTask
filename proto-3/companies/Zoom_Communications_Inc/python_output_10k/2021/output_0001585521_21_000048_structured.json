          "content": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nWe provide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how\npeople interact. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing and\nenable face-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and\nlocations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice that is easy to use, manage,\nand deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces and\napplications. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and\ntrust. We strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that\n“just works.”\nThe cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features\ndesigned to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users are comprised of\nboth hosts who organize video meetings and the individual attendees who participate in those video meetings. In\n2019, we launched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications platform. Many\ncustomers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users to\neasily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. Our partner ecosystem, which includes App\nMarketplace and in-product apps, and developer platform help enterprises create elevated experiences with third-\nparty applications to create customized workflows.\nThe happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites,\nincluding Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2020 Gartner Peer\nInsights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions and a TrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software. Industry\nanalysts also recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting\nSolutions based on our “ability to execute” and “completeness of vision.” In 2020 we also became a Leader in the\nGartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS. Frost & Sullivan recognized Zoom with its Global Connected Work Company of the\nYear award in 2020, as well as awards for Global Video Communications in The COVID-19 Crisis Enabling Technology\nLeadership, Asia-Pacific Cloud Video Collaboration Services Company of The Year, and Indian Cloud Video Enabling\nTechnology Leadership.\nWe have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy\nfor optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience our platform – it just works.\nThis enthusiasm continues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our\ncustomers. Our sales efforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer\nopportunity, which can include our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that\ndelights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these\npractices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our\nexisting customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nhosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the\ndifference of Zoom. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that\nintegrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales\nrepresentatives, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively\ndrive upgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our video platform and become familiar with its\nbenefits, more teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of\nbusiness and then organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our\nlargest deployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, and phone for the full\nZoom Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) experience.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of video communication and\ncollaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of\n6\nTable of Contents\nengineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base.\nAccelerate international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world,\nwe are poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems.\nGrow our partnership ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Our platform integrates easily with other\nsystems and tools. We enable developers to embed our platform into their own offerings through open application\nprogram interfaces (“APIs”) and our cross-platform software development kits (“SDKs”). We have already partnered\nwith several hardware video conferencing and peripheral providers and with software providers, including Atlassian\nand Dropbox. Third-party developers are able to engage with the Zoom App Marketplace and Zoom Developer Platform to\nextend the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development of public and private apps and\nintegrations.\nOur Products\nWe provide a unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact,\nconnecting them through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing. Our core products include\nZoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Chat, Zoom Rooms, Zoom Conference Room Connector, Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom\nDeveloper Platform, and Zoom App Marketplace.\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provide HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems. Our architecture can support up to one thousand video participants in a\nsingle meeting. Conversations can be one to one, one to many, or many to many. Zoom Meetings feature 49-person\nvideo gallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms,\nscreen sharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more\ndone together. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Dropbox, Google,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees who rely on\ntheir mobile device or tablet throughout their business day.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is now available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host\nmeetings with up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings\nby default, but with Zoom’s new E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography\nto distribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nZoom Phone\nZoom Phone is an enterprise cloud phone system that provides powerful private branch exchange (“PBX”) features,\nsuch as secure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail,\nswitch to video, and much more. Available stand alone, or as an optional add-on to Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone is a\ncore component of our modern video-first UCaaS strategy that enables customers to replace their existing PBX\nsolution and consolidate all of their business communications and collaboration requirements onto Zoom.\nZoom Phone provides inbound and outbound calling via its support for native connectivity to the public switched\ntelephone network (“PSTN”). In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, Zoom Phone provided native PSTN connectivity\nin 44 countries and territories including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom\n(“U.K.”), and the United States (“U.S.”).\nZoom Phone also supports Premise Peering and Cloud Peering, which provide enterprise customers with the flexibility\nof keeping their current PSTN service providers by redirecting existing third-party voice circuits to the Zoom\nPhone cloud. Hybrid connectivity is also supported, allowing customers to mix native Zoom Phone Calling Plans and\nthird-party voice circuits. This unique capability allows customers to enjoy all of the benefits and features of\nZoom Phone while keeping their existing service provider contracts, phone numbers, and calling rates with their\npreferred carrier of record.\nZoom Chat\nZoom Chat, which is included in the Zoom client for meeting and phone customers, enables organizations and teams to\ncommunicate and collaborate in groups, channels, or 1-1s and to stay connected by instantly sharing messages,\nimages, audio files, and other content across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. With Zoom Chat users can\neasily invite people outside a user’s organization to a chat conversation, and users can quickly switch from a chat\nto a phone call or video meeting\n7\nTable of Contents\nduring a conversation. Zoom Chat also features content storage for users who want discoverability and the ability\nto review their conversations or shared files. There are dozens of Zoom Chat compatible applications available in\nthe Zoom App Marketplace that provide notifications and improved workflow for other enterprise systems.\nZoom Rooms\nZoom Rooms is our software-based conference room system that transforms every room–from executive offices, huddle\nrooms, training rooms, to broadcast studios–into a collaboration space that is easy to use, simple to deploy, and\neffortless to manage. Designed to increase workforce collaboration across in-room and virtual participants, Zoom\nRooms bring one-click to join meetings, wireless multi-sharing, interactive whiteboarding, and intuitive room\ncontrols for a frictionless and secure Zoom Meeting experience. Zoom Rooms can leverage purpose-built hardware,\nsuch as Zoom Rooms Appliances, for a turnkey deployment, or customize room builds with Zoom’s open hardware\necosystem and professional audio/visual equipment, enabling organizations to build video conference rooms for any\nuse case.\nZoom Rooms Scheduling Display helps meet the needs of the agile office by delivering simple, on-the-fly room\nbooking and room utilization management through a calendaring system. With a single Zoom Rooms license, customers\nget unlimited access to this service, requiring only an iOS or Android touch display outside their rooms.\nZoom Rooms Digital Signage leverages displays, in and out of conference rooms, to project image, video, and URL\ncontent playlists. Included as part of Zoom Rooms, role-based admins can easily manage unlimited Digital Signage\ncontent and displays through the Zoom Admin Portal and remotely control the content displayed across screens for\ncorporate communications, internal marketing, branding, and more.\nZoom Conference Room Connector\nThe Zoom Conference Room Connector is a gateway for SIP/H.323 endpoints to join Zoom meetings. For organizations\nthat use SIP/H.323 conference room systems from providers, such as Poly and Cisco, Zoom’s Conference Room Connector\ncan take these traditional hardware video conferencing systems to the cloud, allowing users to leverage their\nexisting investments while taking advantage of the Zoom platform. As organizations transition from legacy hardware-\nbased conference rooms to software-based Zoom Rooms, IT administrators save cost on layers of service, maintenance,\nand support contracts and bridge their endpoints with Zoom Conference Room Connector. With the cost-savings,\norganizations can reinvest in video-enabling more rooms and continue to leverage their existing SIP/H.323 endpoints\nwith a consistent, cloud-based experience across all their rooms.\nZoom Video Webinars\nZoom Video Webinars support interactive video presentations to large audiences from almost anywhere in the world\nand from many devices. Zoom webinars scale up to 50,000 people including up to 100 interactive video panelists.\nWith webinars, hosts have control over the video viewing experience and attendees join to listen, learn and\ninteract using chat, Q&A, live polling and more. Our powerful third-party integrations help users maximize usage of\ntheir webinars and expand capabilities with paid registration, marketing automation, lead nurturing and learning\nmanagement.\nZoom Developer Platform and Zoom App Marketplace\nZoom Developer Platform allows developers to integrate our video, phone, chat, and content sharing into other\napplications, as well as manage Zoom accounts from any system, with full access to their usage and network metrics\ndata. With our SDKs, APIs and webhooks, Zoom, third-party developers, and partners build applications that\nintegrate our platform with other cloud services. Our customers can also develop highly customizable private\napplications that integrate Zoom into their systems. Our rich toolbox of extensible APIs, cross-platform SDKs, and\nMobileRTC powered an average of more than 1.6 billion API engagements per month for calendar year 2020.\nOur App Marketplace brings together these integrations built by Zoom and third-party developers, making it easy for\ndevelopers to publish their apps and for customers to enhance their Zoom experience with new functionalities. We\nfully vet apps in our marketplace for security and user experience. Zoom App Marketplace features apps and bots\nwith services such as Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, and Google, as well as deep product integrations with Dropbox,\nBox, Atlassian, and Marketo.\nOnZoom and Zoom Apps\nWe recently announced two additions to the Zoom platform: OnZoom and Zoom Apps. OnZoom is a new platform for Zoom\nusers to create, host, and monetize online events. OnZoom is an extension of Zoom’s unified communications platform\nwith robust monetization (ticketing and fundraising) and simpler event management capabilities. OnZoom is currently\noffered as a public beta for U.S. users to host and attend online events. Zoom Apps are a new app type coming soon\nto the Zoom App\n8\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace. These in-product integrations will be accessible directly from Zoom Meetings and the Zoom Desktop\nclient and are designed to facilitate collaboration and engagement during meetings.\nZoom Hardware-as-a-Service\nOur Zoom Hardware-as-a-Service offering allows customers to access the latest and greatest video communication\ntechnology. Customers can deploy a world-class communications experience with a variety of subscription options for\nphone and meeting room hardware. Zoom customers will be able to scale video conference rooms and phones with\nhardware options and hardware refreshes at an affordable, fixed monthly price.\nOur Technology and Infrastructure\nOur unique technology and infrastructure enable best-in-class reliability, scalability, and performance. We\ndesigned our communications platform to be video-first and cloud-native. Most legacy approaches utilize single\nmultipoint control units (“MCUs”) to bridge video and voice participants into an integrated stream that is\nbroadcast back to the participants. These hardware devices are shipped with defined processing and memory capacity\nthat are difficult to scale. In addition, an MCU architecture is similar to other mainframe-like approaches where\nstream processing and mixing run on the same machine, which is resource-intensive and limits scalability.\nOur technology was specifically designed from the start to address the most difficult component of communications:\nvideo. Video requires intense computing resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, as\nwell as higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like\nvoice, chat, and content sharing. Our architecture separates video content processing from the transporting and\nmixing of streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that reside on client devices and\ndynamically encode and decode based upon the performance of client technology, network performance, and bandwidth.\nWe leverage a next-generation multimedia router that operates on commodity hardware and a globally distributed\ncloud infrastructure to determine the optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect\nthe participants.\nOur Customers\nWe have customers of all sizes, from individuals to global Fortune 50 organizations. Our current customer base\nspans numerous industry categories, including education, entertainment/media, enterprise infrastructure, finance,\ngovernment, health care, manufacturing, non-profit/not for profit and social impact, retail/consumer products, and\nsoftware/internet. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 467,100 customers with more than 10 employees.\nSales\nOur sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meeting plan with a sales approach optimized\nfor the size of each customer opportunity. Our direct sales force includes our field sales representatives as well\nas our inside sales team, and it is organized by customer employee count and vertical. Our channel team coordinates\nthe activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong ecosystem that broadens our reach. Our online\nchannel supports high-volume, high-velocity, self-service sales.\nMarketing\nOur marketing team’s primary objective is to create preference for our brand by leveraging our viral growth,\nenhancing brand perception, and engaging our users with virtual events, social media, and customer advisory\ncouncils. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out-of-home advertising. We shifted our events\nstrategy from in-person to online during the pandemic, including hosting Zoomtopia, our annual user conference, to\nover 150,000 unique virtual attendees.\nResearch and Development\nWe drive our business with constant innovation. We have research and development presence in the United States,\nIndia, Singapore and China, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to invest more in\nincreasing our product capabilities in an efficient manner with a “follow the sun” strategy.\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and LogMeIn GoToMeeting, and bundled productivity solution providers with video\nfunctionality, including Google G Suite and Microsoft Teams, as well as UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including\n8x8. Avaya, and RingCentral.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:\nvideo-first platform;\ncloud-native architecture;\nfunctionality and scalability;\nease of use and reliability;\nbrand awareness and preference;\nability to utilize existing infrastructure, such as legacy conference room hardware; and\nlow total cost of ownership.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections,\nto establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions\noriginating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the\nUnited States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and\nexternal controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. This may\ninclude open source software. We take steps to ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses governing such\nlicensed technology. We believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark,\ncopyright, trade secret, license, or other intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated\nwith our intellectual property, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on\nour capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nNevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those\npertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material\nimpact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government\nregulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had 4,422 full-time employees. Of these employees, 2,662 are in the United States and\n1,760 are in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by\ncollective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.\nOur Culture of Happiness\nWe are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We strive to change the way business is done\nthrough our communications technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we have an\nemployee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify our efforts to deliver happiness to our\nemployees and customers.\nOur culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision, and values and is fundamental to everything we do\nat Zoom:\nMission. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nVision. Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video communications.\nValues. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves.\nThis culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent.\nComparably recognized Zoom for numerous culture awards in 2020 including Best Company Happiness and Best CEO. Our\nemployees also named Zoom among the winners of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Awards honoring the Best Places to\nWork in 2021.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) at Zoom is an embodiment of our core value of Care. DEI also represents our\nintentional effort to create an inclusive environment of the brightest minds from a broad set of backgrounds in\norder to create the most innovative solutions for our customers. Our approach to DEI is driven across four\nstrategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how\nwe include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).\nIn June, we hired our first Chief Diversity Officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, to lead our DEI function globally. We\nhave taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College, AnitaB.org\nand a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, we launched our Zoom Talks\ninitiative to create ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about each other's unique backgrounds. We also\nlaunched our inaugural Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) program with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women's, Veterans and\nLGBTQ+ communities. Our DEI Team continues to partner with teams leading our product design and marketing to invest\nin making our products even more inclusive and accessible to the diverse set of communities we serve. Finally, in\nan effort to both further our education internally and provide others outside of Zoom with an opportunity to learn,\nwe created the nine-part learning series, “Race in the Workplace”, in partnership with TIME and renowned expert,\nDr. Shaun Harper.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. Our employees’\ntotal compensation packages include base pay, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best\ninterest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of\nour employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-\nsite work. We also provide flexible work hours in certain cases. We have also provided a work-from-home\nreimbursement policy to assist employees in that transition.\nOur Facilities\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Jose, California, where we lease approximately 103,000 square feet of\ncommercial space pursuant to operating leases that expire in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2030. In addition,\nwe maintain additional offices in the United States and internationally in Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) and Europe, Middle\nEast, and Africa (“EMEA”). We believe that our facilities are suitable to meet our current needs.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2011 under the name Saasbee, Inc., and in\nFebruary 2012, we changed our name to Zoom Communications, Inc.

          "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers and hosts, retain and upsell additional products to\nexisting customers, and upgrade free hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers and hosts, renewals,\nor upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and maintain and expand our relationships\nwith our customers and hosts, including upselling additional products to our existing customers and upgrading hosts\nto a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting\nand invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting\nplan as “paid hosts.”\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers\nwill renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,\nor purchase additional products, if they renew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or\nfluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no\nlonger having a need for our products, including any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic that may subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic\nhas tapered, or the perception that competitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In\naddition, some customers downgrade their Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the increased usage of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted from\nlargely businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could\nresult in higher non-renewal rates than we have experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and\nhosts to grow our business beyond our current user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to\ncontinue to use our platform. Finally, any decrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm\nour brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by\nrecommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand\nwithin organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\nZoom into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we strive to demonstrate the value\nof our platform and various product offerings to those hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan, thereby\nencouraging them to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including those that\nrecently subscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and work-from-\nhome mandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts\nof our free Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within organizations, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nIn addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase and we\nturn our focus to upgrading our free hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan rather than growing the total number of\nusers. If we are not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or\ndecline. Similar to the uncertainty of customers renewing their subscriptions or hosts upgrading to a paid Zoom\nMeeting plan, we expect our user growth rate to slow or decline once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic tapers,\nparticularly as a vaccine becomes widely available, and users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer\nsubject to shelter-in-place mandates.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors,\nincluding increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, would impair the delivery of our services, require\nus to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers in\norder to optimize performance on our platform. Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past\nresulted in and could in the future result in interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, other interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety\nof other factors, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors,\nviruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in\nusage, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that\nimpacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new\ndata centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or\ntransfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite\nprecautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in\nthe delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay\npenalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause customers and hosts to terminate their\nsubscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts. Our ability to attract and\nretain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide customers and hosts with a highly reliable platform\nand even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, including increased\nusage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek\nto obtain additional capacity, which could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications\nplatform because of its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers\nto meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner,\nincluding as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term\ncapacity needs, we may need to rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and\nOracle Cloud, which may result in higher variable costs and harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and similar events, any of which could disrupt\nour service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant\nperiod of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for\nall eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of\nterrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other\nunanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain\nfeatures of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products\noffered by:\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and LogMeIn GoToMeeting;\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect\ncompetition to intensify in the future. For example, we recently introduced Zoom Phone, a cloud phone system that\nallows customers to replace their existing PBX solution, which will result in increased competition against\ncompanies that offer similar services and new competitors that may enter that market in the future. Also, in\nconnection with the travel restrictions and stay-in-place policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have\nseen a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from smaller customers, many of whom are consumers or small\nand medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller customers, we face competition from more consumer-\noriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the consumer market than we do. Further, many of our\nactual and potential competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater name\n13\nTable of Contents\nrecognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and services; larger marketing budgets; more\nestablished marketing relationships; third-party integration; greater accessibility across devices or applications;\naccess to larger user bases; major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater\nfinancial, technical, and other resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic\nrelationships to offer a broader range of products and services than we do. These combinations may make it more\ndifficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or\nmaintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nforced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on\noccasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in\ndeferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts\nreceivable.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any\nprior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. We expect our revenue growth rate to\ngenerally decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher\nmarket penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our platform, especially once the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic tapers, particularly as a vaccine becomes widely available, and users return to work or school or\nare otherwise no longer subject to shelter-in-place mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth\nopportunities, and the maturation of our business, among others. If our growth rate declines, investors’\nperceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our\nbusiness.\nOur quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our\nresults of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon\nas an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety\nof factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business. For example, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced\nunprecedented usage of our unified communications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant\nportion of which is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased\ndemand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our\ninfrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on\npublic cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the\nvalue of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include,\nwithout limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our\npaid Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\n14\nTable of Contents\nthe length of our sales cycles, especially with respect to sales to large enterprises and highly-regulated\nindustries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases; and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service; network outages; or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits; regulatory actions or investigations; legislator scrutiny; or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users grow and their usage\nof communications capacity increases, including increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be\nrequired to make additional investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the\navailability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity\nis not available to us as our user base grows, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high\ndata transmission capacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third\nparties providing internet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not\nhave access to our platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate\nof adoption of new technologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently\nadapt to the increased demand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause\ncurrent or potential users to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our\ncompetitors or to avoid our platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The\norder requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management\npractices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient\nto enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and\nother small businesses to develop,\n15\nTable of Contents\nmarket, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11, 2018. Numerous parties filed\njudicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to the new rules, but reversed the\nFCC's decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet service, requiring case-\nby-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC's rules. The court also\nrequired the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to remain in effect, while the FCC\nconducts that review. On February 6, 2020, the court denied requests for rehearing of the original decision, and\nthe deadline for petitions requesting the Supreme Court to review the decision has passed without the filing of any\nsuch petitions. On February 19, 2020, the FCC released a public notice asking for comment on the three issues the\ncourt required it to reexamine. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that the three issues\nremanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order. Petitions for\nreconsideration of this decision are pending. Democratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC\nfollowing the 2020 elections increases the likelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or\nadopt new network neutrality rules. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering\nlegislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. On February 23, 2021, a\nfederal court judge denied a request for injunction against California’s state-specific network neutrality law, and\nas a result, California will soon begin enforcing that law. On March 10, 2021, trade associations representing\ninternet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction. We cannot\npredict whether the FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by\nlegal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the new rules, broadband internet access\nproviders may be able to charge web-based services such as ours for priority access or favor services offered by\nour competitors or by the internet access providers themselves, which could result in increased costs and a loss of\nexisting customers and hosts, impair our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater\ndeployment challenges.\nAs we continue to grow, we have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large\norganizations typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size,\norganizational structure, and approval requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face\nunexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large\norganizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional\nsecurity management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large\norganizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our\nplatform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we\nanticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater\nunpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if any new customers or hosts that have\nsubscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the\nimpact of the pandemic has tapered, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\nease of adoption and use;\n16\nTable of Contents\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past, and we expect to increase our expenses in the future, which could\nprevent us from maintaining profitability.\nAlthough we generated net income of $672.3 million, $25.3 million and $7.6 million for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, we have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses\nin the future. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing\nefforts to attract new customers and hosts and to develop and enhance our products and for general corporate\npurposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses,\nupgrading our infrastructure, and addressing security and privacy issues, including those stemming from the\nunprecedented numbers of first-time users during the COVID-19 pandemic who may not have full IT support or\nestablished protocols like our enterprise customers, and expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we\nare successful in increasing our user base, we may also incur increased losses because, other than sales\ncommissions, the costs associated with acquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the\nsubscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or\non a multiyear basis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to\nincrease our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future\nfor a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses,\ndifficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. For example, we have faced unprecedented usage\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and, to meet this increased demand, have incurred and expect to continue to incur\nsignificant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher\nvariable costs to the extent we have to rely on public cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Despite\nthese significant investments, a majority of these new hosts using our platform on a free Basic account may never\nupgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we are unable to sustain profitability, the value of our business and Class\nA common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our\nmarket, customer demand for our platform, user adoption and renewal of our platform, the entry of competitive\nproducts and services, or the success of existing competitive products and services. As a result, we may not\nmaintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our\ninvestments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other\nproductivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors\nown, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute\noperating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform\nrequires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and\nservices that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business\npartners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with\n17\nTable of Contents\ntheir products or services. As our respective products evolve, we expect this level of competition to increase.\nShould any of our competitors modify their products or standards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our\nplatform or gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive\nposition or for any other reason, the interoperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. If we do not comply with these requirements, we could lose access to the\napp store and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from\ncustomers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and\nproducts; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.\nOur customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest\nsignificantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality\nand ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic user demand for our platform. For example,\nin October 2020 we introduced two new additions to our Zoom platform, OnZoom and Zoom Apps. There is no assurance\nthat these new additions or other future enhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or\ncapabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If\nour research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand or if we fail to develop our\nplatform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may\nfail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing\nthat could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,\nor capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and\ncapabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released\naccording to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or\nclaims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to\nour platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.\nIf customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not\nperform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,\nlicense, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such\nenhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and\nservices will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan\nto continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are\nunable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to\nacquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our\nefforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our\nnew sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our\nsales and marketing programs are not effective.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOur security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security\nmeasures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,\nexpose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products\nand services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or\nceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of customer and user data or information, and security\nincidents have occurred in the past, and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of, this information, regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, and other possible liabilities, as well as negative\npublicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales, and harm our business. Cyberattacks and other\nmalicious internet-based activity continue to increase, and cloud-based platform providers of products and services\nhave been and are expected to continue to be targeted. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” we face\nsecurity risks from malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing incidents, credential stuffing attacks,\nemployee theft, misuse of information or systems, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and\nadvanced persistent threat intrusions. Moreover, security incidents can result in interruptions, delays, or outages\nin our operations and services, including due to ransomware or denial-of-service attacks. Despite significant\nefforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. If\nour security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee, customer, host or user error,\nmalfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials, or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged; our\ndata, information or intellectual property, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise\ncompromised; our business may be harmed; and we could incur significant liability. We have not always been able in\nthe past and may be unable in the future to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit\nvulnerabilities in our services or software or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise\nour systems, because such threats and techniques change frequently and are generally not detected until after an\nincident has occurred. In addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue\nin the future to actively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services.\nThis activity may increase because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified\ncommunications platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the\nZoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software\naddressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by\nthese vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and\ntheir software is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security\nresearcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized\nperson to gain root access to a user’s system. We cannot be certain that we will be able to address any\nvulnerabilities in our software that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in developing\npatches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. We expect similar issues to arise in the\nfuture as our products and services are more widely adopted, and as we continue to expand the features and\nfunctionality of existing products and introduce new products. We expect to expend significant resources in an\neffort to protect against security incidents and to mitigate, detect, and remediate actual and potential\nvulnerabilities. Security incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security may cause some of our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or\nrenew their subscriptions. This discontinuance in use or failure to upgrade or renew could substantially harm our\nbusiness. Further, as we rely on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, we depend in part on third-party\nsecurity measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and the mishandling of data and\ninformation. In addition, failures to meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and\nconfidentiality of their data and information could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain\ncustomers and hosts, attract new customers and hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or\nsecurity vulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including\nclass action litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs\nfor remediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease\nin customer, host, and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs\nto address cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and\nsettlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because of any such incident.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving\ncertain types of personal data. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach\nis costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches. Security\ncompromises experienced by our competitors, our customers, or us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to\nwidespread negative publicity. In addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States,\nlike many similarly situated technology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel\nin China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and\nmedia scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.\nAny security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our\n19\nTable of Contents\nreputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures; negatively affect our ability to\nattract new customers and hosts; cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions; or subject us\nto third-party lawsuits, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and fines, or other action or liability, which\ncould harm our business and reputation. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional\nawareness of Zoom and our brand could lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative\nperception of our information security and potential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For example, in\nconnection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading\nto challenges for users who did not have full IT support or established protocols for security and privacy like our\nenterprise customers. As a result, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and\nsecurity and privacy issues, including on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in\nmaterial reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure,\nadditional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use\nor other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or\ndamages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance\ncoverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny\ncoverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are not\ncovered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including\npremium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our business.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that our brand identity and awareness have contributed to our success and have helped fuel our efficient\ngo-to-market strategy. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, voice, chat, and content sharing.\nWe also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers,\nhosts, and users and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad\ncommunications platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users incorrectly view the Zoom\nbrand primarily as a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform with multiple\ncommunications solutions, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market position may\nbe detrimentally impacted at such time as a competitor introduces a new or better product. We anticipate that, as\nour market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult\nand expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or perception of our platform, including any delays or interruptions in\nservice due to capacity constraints stemming from increased usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or of our privacy\nor security features, or of the providers of communication and collaboration technologies generally, could\nadversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain hosts. Similarly, any unfavorable perception\nof our company, including due to any actual or perceived violation by our employees of our policies, such as our\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause us reputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial\nperformance, expose us to litigation, and harm our business, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain\nthe Zoom brand, including consumer and public perception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive\nexpenses in this effort, our business will be harmed.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our headcount has grown from 2,532 full-\ntime employees as of January 31, 2020, to 4,422 full-time employees as of January 31, 2021, with employees located\nboth in the United States and internationally. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous,\nsignificant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to\nsupport our user base, our expanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our\ninternal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to\ngrow, we face challenges integrating, developing, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various\ncountries around the world. For example, a significant number of our employees were hired in recent months and have\nnever been to one of our office locations. Certain members of our management have not previously worked together\nfor an extended period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a public company, which may affect\nhow they manage our growth. Managing our growth will also require significant expenditures and allocation of\nvaluable management resources.\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for\nand model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties\nfrequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary\nlevel of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth,\nour business would be harmed.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur business may be significantly affected by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer\nor business spending.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand any resulting effect on spending by our customers. While some of our customers may consider our platform to be\na cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform as\na discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their discretionary spending on our platform during an\neconomic downturn. Given current economic conditions, we could experience a reduction in demand and loss of\ncustomers, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact on various\nindustries that our unified communications platform addresses. We would lose customers as a result of customers\nceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty\nin collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. While we have seen increased usage stemming from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free Basic\naccounts, which do not generate any revenue. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will experience an increase in\npaid hosts once the pandemic tapers, particularly in light of the economic downturn. Similarly, given the shift in\nour customer base from largely businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that we will see higher rates of non-renewals than we have experienced\nhistorically.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, EMEA and\nAPAC. All of our executive officers are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key person life insurance\npolicies. Any changes in our senior management team in particular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be\ndisruptive to our business. While we seek to prepare for such transitions, including by establishing strong\nprocesses and procedures and succession planning, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and\ncause disruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively or execute our\nplans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover or otherwise, our business could be\nharmed.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in April 2019 and\npotential candidates may not perceive our compensation package, including our equity awards, as favorably as\nemployees hired prior to our IPO. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be\naltered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes\nin a timely manner. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. We must also continue to retain and motivate existing employees through our compensation\npractices, company culture, and career development opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain\nour current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\nIn addition, following our IPO, many of our employees are now able to receive significant proceeds from sales of\nour equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, this\nliquidity could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 31%, 19%, and 18% of our total revenue for the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in further\nselect international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with global users, and we\nexpect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions\nand providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any\nnew markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our\nplatform may not be receptive. For example, if we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-specific\nrequirements, we may experience service outages or other adverse consequences which would impair our ability to\nexpand further into certain markets. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations\ninternationally in the future may require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international\nexpansion will require investment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex\nemployment- and compensation-related laws, regulations and practices in these international jurisdictions, and\nmaintaining our company culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to\nemployees in certain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations.\nThis may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash\ncompensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees\nin these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\n22\nTable of Contents\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection and\nunsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our\npractices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as does the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as does the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United\nStates, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual\nproperty outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”\") withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade\nprotection measures, import or export requirements, trade embargoes, and other trade barriers;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a\ntimely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and\nregulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease\noperations in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, while our engineering team is headquartered in the\nUnited States, we employ a product development team that has a relatively significant footprint in China today,\nwhere personnel costs are less expensive than in many other geographies. This product development team carries out\nthe design and architecture decisions made by our U.S. engineering team. We recently announced our intent to expand\nour research and development presence in Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as in Singapore and\nIndia. As a result of this expansion, we could experience, among other things, difficulty in attracting and\nretaining talent in these location and higher operating expenses, which would adversely impact our operating\nmargins and harm our business.\nAt the same time, our operations in China have caused and may in the future cause us to be subject to regulatory\nscrutiny both in China and in the United States. For example, in September 2019, the Chinese government turned off\nour service in China without warning and requested that we take certain steps prior to restoring our service,\nincluding designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests and transferring China-based user data\nhoused in the United States to a data center in China. Also, in June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the\nDepartment of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of\nJustice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of\n23\nTable of Contents\nCalifornia (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our interactions\nwith foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as about\nstorage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY subpoena\nrequested information about the actions we took relating to the Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. The NDCA subpoena\nalso requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We are fully\ncooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation.\nThese investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately\ndiscover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict\nthe outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur\nsubstantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan\nmust be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers\nand hosts and, consequently, our business.\nWe have designed our platform to be easy to adopt and use with minimal to no support necessary. However, if we\nexperience increased user demand for support, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations.\nSurging demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to allocate additional resources to support our\nexpanded user base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time. In addition,\nas we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide\nefficient support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. Customers and hosts receive\nadditional support features, and the number of our hosts has grown significantly, which will put additional\npressure on our support organization. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we\nneed to hire additional support personnel, including as a result of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour business may be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and\non positive recommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our\nbusiness.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor\ntheir products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant\ntime and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to\nscale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and\ntraining. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to\neffectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop\nrelationships with new\n24\nTable of Contents\nresellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to manage, train, or\nprovide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of new customers and\nhosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our business.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nsmall amount is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of\nthe jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,\n20.2%, 9.4%, and 6.4% of our revenue, respectively, and 11.9%, 17.5%, and 12.3% of our expenses, respectively, were\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations\nin currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could\nmaterially impact our results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.\nWe expect to increase our sales to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency customers. For example,\nwe announced in May 2019 that we received authorization under the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) that allows U.S. federal government agencies and contractors to securely use our Zoom for\nGovernment offering. The additional risks and challenges associated with doing business with governmental entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will\ngenerate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government\nsector until we have attained such certificates;\ngovernmental entities may have significant leverage in negotiations, thereby enabling such entities to demand\ncontract terms that differ from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements, including, for example,\nmost-favored-nation clauses; and\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced by public sector budgetary cycles and funding\nauthorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector demand for our\nproducts.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities in the future, our exposure to such\nrisks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our business.\nOur current products, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase\nour base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially\nsuffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products\nto new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our products, or\nthe introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current products, as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate\ncarriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that\nwill use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our\nmargins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products. In\n25\nTable of Contents\naddition, new products that we introduce in the future may similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties, all of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If this trend continues with our\nnew and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid host base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWhile to date we have not incurred significant income taxes in operating our business, we are subject to income\ntaxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could\nfluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax\nrates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses; changes in excess tax benefits\nof stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use, deferred tax assets; the\napplicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples; changes in U.S. federal, state, or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such\nas the recent legislation enacted in the United States, other fundamental changes in law currently being considered\nby many countries; and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and\npositions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax\nauthorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take, and if any such tax authority were to\nsuccessfully challenge any such position, our business could be harmed.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in federal, state, or international tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed of enacted Digital Services Taxes (\"DST\"), many of which would apply to revenues derived from digital\nservices. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of the OECD's\nInclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing\nour future tax obligations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had $1,264.3 million of U.S. federal and $797.0 million of state net operating loss\ncarryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2032 for federal and 2027\nfor state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating\nloss carryforwards before their expiration or at all. Under legislative changes made in December 2017, as modified\nby the federal tax law changes enacted in March 2020, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2020, the deductibility of such net operating losses is limited. In addition, the\nfederal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be\n26\nTable of Contents\nsubject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the “Code”), respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, if a\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or\ntax may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership\nby “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may\napply under state tax laws. We have completed a Section 382 review and have determined that none of the operating\nlosses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s). However, we may experience ownership changes in the\nfuture as a result of future shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an\nownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits is materially\nlimited, it would harm our business by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nIn addition, for state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is\nsuspended or otherwise limited, including a recent California franchise tax law change limiting the usability of\nCalifornia state net operating losses to offset California taxable income in taxable years beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2020 and before January 1, 2023, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets for the U.S. and U.K. as of both January\n31, 2021 and January 31, 2020. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax\nassets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. In\nour valuation allowance evaluation, we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified than to\nevidence that cannot be objectively verified. Our consideration of the evidence requires management to make a\nnumber of significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters.\nGiven our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that\nin the foreseeable future, sufficient positive evidence may become available that results in a conclusion that a\nportion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the\nrecognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is\nrecorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the\nbasis of the level of profitability (pretax income adjusted for permanent differences) that we are able to actually\nachieve.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies.\nFor example, we announced our acquisition of Keybase Inc in May 2020. We have limited experience in acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on\nfavorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive\nposition or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, developers, or\ninvestors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or effectively manage the\ncombined company following an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or\ntechnologies associated with those acquisitions, into our company, the results of operations of the combined\ncompany could be adversely affected. Any integration process will require significant time and resources, require\nsignificant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able\nto manage the process successfully, which could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or\nutilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction,\nincluding accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nBeginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our video-first unified\ncommunications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our\nbusiness, and we have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to\nforecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our\nability to plan for and model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered\nindicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue\ncould decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;\ncontraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for\ncapacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic\nhas also made it difficult to forecast revenue, costs, and expenses, as our platform has recently faced\n27\nTable of Contents\nunprecedented usage from free users and new and existing customers, requiring us to devote significant resources to\nbolster our capacity and infrastructure. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently\nexperienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described\nherein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are\nincorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nprivacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual\nobligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.\nWe receive, store, process, generate, use, and share personal information and other customer and user content\nnecessary to provide our service and ensure it is delivered effectively, to operate our business, for legal and\nmarketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. There are numerous federal, state, local, and\ninternational laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the collection,\nstoring, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content,\nthe scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among\ncountries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual\nobligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. We strive to comply\nwith applicable laws, certifications, documentation, publications, regulations, standards, policies and other\nobligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security to the extent possible. Although we\nendeavor to comply with applicable laws and our policies, publications, certifications, and documentation, and\nother obligations, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our\nefforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, vendors or business partners do not\ncomply with our policies, certifications, and documentation. Such actual or perceived failures in certain cases\nhave subjected, and can subject, us to potential international, local, state and federal legal or regulatory\naction, including in the event that our policies, certifications, and documentation are found or alleged to be\ninaccurate, incomplete, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. The regulatory framework\nfor privacy and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain, uncertain for the foreseeable future, which\nwe expect will increase our compliance costs and exposure to liability, and it is possible that these or other\nactual or alleged obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction\nto another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our\nservices, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic could make it more\ndifficult for us to comply with our contractual obligations, our policies, our publications, our certifications,\nour documentation, standards, regulations, and applicable laws related to privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity, and has and could result in greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our\nprivacy, data protection, and information security practices. Any compliance failure, as well as greater public\nscrutiny of our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, could result in increased\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nFor example, in June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office\nfor EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign political\nparties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user data, the\ndevelopment and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the Tiananmen\ncommemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office\nfor the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various security, data\nprotection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as\ncalculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information\nrelating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or\nsuccessful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate\nto users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related\ninformation. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough\ninternal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which\nfacts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not\ntake. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters\ncould cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational\nharm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, industry standards, guidance and\ncontractual obligations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in\nvarious jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect\nin the EU. The GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and requires us and our customers to give\nmore detailed disclosures\n28\nTable of Contents\nabout how we collect, use and share personal information; contractually commit to data protection measures in our\ncontracts with clients; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of\ncertain data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals’\ndata protection rights, including their rights to access, correct and delete their personal information. The GDPR\nprovides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR\ncan face private litigation, restrictions on data processing, and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or\n4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers’, partners’, or vendors’ failure to comply with the GDPR\ncould lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or restrictions on our ability to process personal\ninformation as needed to provide our product and services. We may also be obligated to assist our customers,\npartners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the GDPR, which could require expenditure of\nsignificant resources. Assisting our customers, partners, and vendors in complying with the GDPR, or complying with\nthe GDPR ourselves, may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business\npractices.\nFurther, the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty in data\nprotection issues involving the U.K. For example, pursuant to a post-Brexit trade deal between the U.K. and the EU,\ntransfers of personal information from the European Economic Area to the U.K. are not considered restricted\ntransfers under the GDPR for a period of up to six months from January 1, 2021. However, unless the EU Commission\nmakes an adequacy finding with respect to the U.K. before the end of that period, the U.K. will be considered a\n“third country” under the GDPR and transfers of European personal information to the U.K. will require an adequacy\nmechanism to render such transfers lawful under the GDPR. Additionally, although the U.K. enacted a Data Protection\nAct in May 2018 that is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers\nto and from the U.K. will be regulated notwithstanding Brexit. The effects of Brexit have been and are expected to\ncontinue to be far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and\neconomic conditions globally, and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit\ncould also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K. and the\nEU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as\nthe U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will remain\nso until the U.K. and EU reach a definitive resolution with regards to outstanding trade and legal matters. Given\nthese possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent\nto which our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is\nuncertain.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal information from\nEurope, including the European Economic Area, U.K. and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries\nunless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal\ninformation. One of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe has\nbeen certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce. However, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision\ninvalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. The same decision also raised questions about whether one of the\nprimary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses,\ncan lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries.\nSimilarly, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner announced that the\nSwiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is inadequate for personal information transfers from Switzerland to the United\nStates, and also raised questions about the viability of the Standard Contractual Clauses. At present, there are\nfew, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, and the Standard\nContractual Clauses, all of which are mechanisms on which we have relied for personal information transfers from\nEurope to the United States and other countries. Authorities in the U.K. may similarly invalidate use of the\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield and raise questions on the viability of the Standard Contractual Clauses, as mechanisms for\nlawful personal information transfers to the United States and other countries. In November 2020, EU regulators\nproposed a new set of Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). The new SCCs impose additional obligations and\nrequirements with respect to the transfer of EU personal data to other jurisdictions, which may increase the legal\nrisks and liabilities under the GDPR and local EU laws associated with cross-border data transfers, and result in\nmaterial increased compliance and operational costs. If we are unable to implement a valid solution for personal\ninformation transfers from Europe, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and\ninjunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe, and we may be required to increase\nour data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. Inability to import personal information from\nEurope to the United States or other countries may decrease demand for our products and services as our customers\nthat are subject to the GDPR may seek alternatives that do not involve personal information transfers out of\nEurope. Our inability to import personal information to the United States and other countries may decrease the\nfunctionality or effectiveness of our products and services and adversely impact our marketing efforts, plans and\nactivities. We expect EU regulators to aggressively enforce EU laws prohibiting data transfers to the U.S. and\nother countries without a legally sound transfer mechanism, and it possible that EU regulators could prevent Zoom\nfrom transferring any personal data out of the EU to certain countries like the U.S.\nAdditionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data\ntransfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency and restricting cross-border data transfer, which\ncould increase the\n29\nTable of Contents\ncost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. For example, Brazil recently enacted the\nGeneral Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), which broadly\nregulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance obligations and penalties comparable to\nthose of the GDPR.\nStates have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. For example, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy\nprotections. The CCPA gives California residents, among other things, expanded rights to access and require\ndeletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed\ninformation about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for\nviolations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The\nCCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”),\nwhich was approved by California voters in November 2020, becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other\nthings, give consumers the ability to limit use of information deemed to be sensitive, increase the maximum\npenalties for violations concerning consumers under age 16, establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to\nimplement and enforce the new law, and impose administrative fines. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA, and their\ninterpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in\nan effort to comply.\nThe CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, as\nother states may follow California’s lead and increase protections for their residents. The CCPA has already\nprompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our\npotential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective\nOctober 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among\nother things, that businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from\nconsumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Virginia has similarly enacted a comprehensive privacy\nlaw, the Consumer Data Protection Act, which emulates the CCPA and CPRA in many respects and takes effect on\nJanuary 1, 2023.\nThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a U.S. Federal law that applies to operators of\ncommercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal\ninformation from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are\ncollecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications services to\nschools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid classrooms, distance\nlearning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these services, Zoom may be used\nby students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information from such students on\nbehalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s information practices on\nbehalf of students, prior to students using the services. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain processing of the\npersonal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on the country) without parental consent. The\nCCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California under 16 (or parental consent for children\nunder 13) before selling their personal information. COPPA is subject to interpretation by courts and other\ngovernmental authorities, including the FTC, and the FTC is authorized to promulgate, and has promulgated,\nrevisions to regulations implementing provisions of COPPA. Although we strive to ensure that our platform and\napplications are compliant with applicable provisions of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, these provisions may be\nmodified, interpreted, or applied in new manners that we may be unable to anticipate or prepare for appropriately,\nand we may incur substantial costs or expenses in attempting to modify our systems, platform, applications, or\nother technology to address changes in COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, or interpretations thereof. If we fail to\naccurately anticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, we\ncould be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions, litigation, fines and\npenalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such failures, we could be in\nbreach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us, which could harm our\nreputation and business.\nWith laws and regulations, such as the GDPR in the EU as well as the CCPA, SPI Law, HIPAA, and COPPA in the United\nStates imposing relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and\napplication of these and other laws and regulations, we have faced and may face additional challenges in addressing\ntheir requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and\nexpenses in an effort to do so, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAdditional uses of our services arising out of increased demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require\nus to address additional privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies,\nand contractual obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, regulations,\nstandards, policies, and contractual obligations, or our privacy policies, publications, certifications, or\ndocumentation have led and could lead to governmental investigations or enforcement actions (including\ninvestigations or actions by state attorneys general, federal regulators, and international regulators), litigation\n(including class action litigation), claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others,\nand could result in significant liability, fines or penalties, or cause our users to lose trust in us, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nWe also have been the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations\nand practices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January\n19, 2021. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information. We could fail or be perceived to fail\nto comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other orders or settlements relating to litigation\nor governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and security practices. Any failure or perceived failure\nto comply with such orders or settlements may increase the possibility of additional adverse consequences,\nincluding litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions, or monetary penalties, or require further changes\nto our business practices, significant management time, or the diversion of significant operational resources.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other\nobligations that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the\noverall demand for, our platform and services, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and\nfeatures, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and\nprocess user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,\ndisclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and\ncustomers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their\nown IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with\ncontrol over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by\nmalicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our\nproducts directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened\ntougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The direct and indirect effects of\ntariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China\neconomic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of\ngovernmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions\nand further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China,\ncould result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade\nrestrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken\nby the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or\nother countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries\nin retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between the United States and China could exacerbate\nthese actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law\nin Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with\nthe business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy\nor operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and\ncertain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or react to these changes.\n31\nTable of Contents\nFurther, in May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic\npowers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in\ntransactions that imposed undue national security risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the\nSecretary of Commerce and applies to contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. In addition,\nthe U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement further restrictions that\nwould affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing,\ncontent, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will successfully mitigate any\nnegative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the executive order and its\nimplementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of\nincreased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our\nsubscription services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nWe collect sales tax in a number of jurisdictions. One or more states or countries may seek to impose incremental\nor new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us. A successful assertion by a state, country, or other\njurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes could, among\nother things, result in substantial tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage\npotential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental cost of any such sales or other related\ntaxes, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, any additional\ntaxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical\npresence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales of\nour platform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. However, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient\nphysical presence or nexus for a state or local jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made\nover the internet, and there is also uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our platform as not taxable\nin certain jurisdictions will be accepted by state and local taxing authorities.\nTaxing authorities may challenge our position that we do not have sufficient nexus in a taxing jurisdiction or that\nour platform is not taxable in the jurisdiction which could result in increased tax liabilities for us or our\ncustomers and hosts, which could harm our business.\nThe application of indirect taxes (such as sales tax, use tax, telecommunications tax, VAT, GST, and gross receipts\ntax) to businesses that transact online, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. Following the recent U.S.\nSupreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. , states are now free to levy taxes on sales of goods and\nservices based on an “economic nexus,” regardless of whether the seller has a physical presence in the state. As a\nresult, it may be necessary to reevaluate whether our activities give rise to sales, use, and other indirect taxes\nas a result of any nexus in those jurisdictions in which we are not currently registered to collect and remit\ntaxes. Additionally, we may need to assess our potential tax collection and remittance liabilities based on\nexisting economic nexus laws’ dollar and transaction thresholds. We continue to analyze our exposure for such taxes\nand liabilities and have accrued $58.1 million and $34.0 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for\nloss contingencies resulting from these potential taxes and liabilities. The application of existing, new, or\nfuture laws, whether in the United States or internationally, could harm our business. There have been, and will\ncontinue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in\nthe numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in apparent violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently made\nour software products available to some customers, including users in embargoed or sanctioned countries, in\napparent violation of the EAR. As a result, we submitted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures concerning\npotential violations of U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”).\nIn June 2019, OFAC and BIS issued us warning letters as their final enforcement responses to these potential\nviolations, but no fines or penalties were assessed. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions\nor export control laws in the future, it could result in fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected\nthrough other penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working\nto implement additional controls designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls\nmay not be fully effective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that\ncould result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,\nchanges in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with\nthe laws.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the\nhost or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful\nbehavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety\nteam may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or\nreferral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as\na result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely\nbetween jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to\nlegal actions along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may\nface, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the\ncontent shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nOur platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has\nbeen blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,\nor fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we\ncould be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, amended, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-\nkickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees and\nintermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to government officials and\nother recipients for improper purposes. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, our\nexposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to expand our international presence, and any failure to\ncomply with such laws could harm our business.\n33\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In\naddition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nChanges in FCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations\non our other services. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that three issues remanded by the\nU.S. Court of Appeals following the appeal of its 2018 decision to eliminate its network neutrality rules did not\nprovide a basis to alter its conclusions in that order. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending.\nDemocratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the\nlikelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. Such\naction could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the\nones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to\nmodify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation\ncould result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many\nMembers of Congress from both parties support reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional\naction remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to adopt rules\ninterpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that is\ntransmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a vote\non that proposal and the FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The\nDemocratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of\nthe FCC. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or the FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same\nlevel of protection offered by Section 230. This would increase the risks faced by internet-based businesses, like\nZoom, that rely on third-party content. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer. We generally pass USF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our\ncustomers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in our products becoming more expensive. We expect that\nstate public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to\nservices like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our\nbusiness, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings,\nexit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every\nsignificant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an\nimportant factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately\nprotect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in\nthose trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may\nknowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third parties may challenge our proprietary right;\npending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to\nprevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the\ndevelopment of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies\nand processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants,\nand third parties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others\nmay independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or\ndevelop similar technologies and processes. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same\nlevel of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks,\ntrade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain\ncountries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending\nour intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of\ntheft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including\ntechnical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our\nintellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial\nadvantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary\nto enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is\ninadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible\nassets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features.\nAny of these events would harm our business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our\nlicensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open\nsource software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in the usage of our unified communications platform,\nand as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly increased, while at the same time,\nthe broader market has experienced significant declines and volatility. There are no assurances that the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock will continue at this level for any period of time. Moreover, the trading price\nof our Class A common stock could experience a significant decrease once the scope and impact of the COVID-19\npandemic is better understood. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our\nClass A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock\ninclude the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n36\nTable of Contents\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April and June 2020, we and certain of our officers and directors were sued in putative\nclass action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities\nlaws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our data privacy and security measures.\nWe may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future. Securities litigation against us could\nresult in substantial costs and divert our management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which\ncould harm our business. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nSecurities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention\nand resources.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of March 9,\n2021, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 71.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding 61.6% of\nsuch voting power in the aggregate. As of March 9, 2021, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric\nS. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 8.4% of our outstanding capital stock but controlled\napproximately 30.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have significant\ninfluence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election\nof directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or our assets, for the\nforeseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one share of Class A\ncommon stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or incapacity of Mr. Yuan,\n(ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his\nemployment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding\nshares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our\nIPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly\npublic companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected\nindices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the\nS&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for\ninclusion in any of these indices,\n37\nTable of Contents\nand as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track\nthese indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are new, and it is as of yet unclear what effect,\nif any, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible\nthat they may depress these valuations or depress our trading volume compared to those of other similar companies\nthat are included.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could\n38\nTable of Contents\nlimit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock and\ncould also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using legacy communication\nmethods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product feature that every\ncustomer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform does not provide. The\nvariables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no\nguarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates\nwill purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the markets in which\nwe compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons\noutside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm\nour business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted virtually every\ncountry in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an\nadverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service\ndisruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to\nsupport our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. We have removed the 40-minute time\nlimit from our free Basic accounts for customers in K-12 schools in certain countries. While we have seen increased\nusage of our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which\ndo not generate any revenue. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or\nthat new or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels after the COVID-19 pandemic has\ntapered. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has required and will\ncontinue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of\nequity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to\nthe rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have\n40\nTable of Contents\nexpended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs\nand significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The\nNasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\n41\nTable of Contents",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ZM.”\nHolders of Record\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had 58 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 21 holders of record of our\nClass B common stock. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held in street name by brokers and\nother nominees on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our\nClass A common stock represented by these holders of record.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash\ndividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on\na number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual\nrestrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC, for purposes of\nSection 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed\nto be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act.\nThe following graph compares (i) the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A common stock from April 18,\n2019 (the date our Class A common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market) through January 31,\n2021 with (ii) the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index (“RUT”) and the Nasdaq Computer Index (“IXCO”)\nover the same period, assuming the investment of $100 in our Class A common stock and in both of the other indices\non April 18, 2019 and the reinvestment of dividends. The graph uses the closing market price on April 18, 2019 of\n$62.00 per share as the initial value of our Class A common stock.

          "content": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nWe provide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how\npeople interact. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, voice, chat, and content sharing and\nenable face-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and\nlocations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video that is easy to use, manage, and deploy;\nprovides an attractive return on investment; is scalable; and easily integrates with applications and physical\nspaces. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust.\nWe strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that “just\nworks” while prioritizing their privacy and security. Our goal is to make Zoom Meetings better than in-person\nmeetings. Our 21 co-located data centers located worldwide and the public cloud enable us to provide both high-\nquality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth environments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications platform. Subscription revenue is\ndriven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products, including Zoom Rooms,\nZoom Video Webinars, Zoom Phone, and Hardware-as-a-Service (“HaaS”) for rooms and phones. A host is any user of our\nunified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join that\nmeeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We define a customer as a\nseparate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size (including a\ndistinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Basic offering is free and gives hosts access\nto Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that meetings with more than two endpoints time-out at\n40 minutes. Our paid offerings include our Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education, and Healthcare plans, which\nprovide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant limits, administrative controls, and\nreporting.\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in three specific markets (United States/Canada, United\nKingdom/Ireland, and Australia/New Zealand). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in over 40 countries and territories where\nZoom has local PSTN coverage. In addition, the Zoom United plan launched in December 2020 provides a single license\nfor customers to purchase Zoom Phone, Meetings and chat capabilities as a bundled offering.\nOur revenue was $2,651.4 million, $622.7 million, and $330.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021,\n2020, and 2019, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rate of 326% and 88% for fiscal year 2021 and\nfiscal year 2020,\n45\nTable of Contents\nrespectively. We had net income of $672.3 million, $25.3 million, and $7.6 million for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,471.2 million,\n$151.9 million, and $51.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of the COVID-19 disease was first identified and began to spread across the globe. In\nMarch 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, impacting many countries around the world.\nGovernments have instituted lockdown or other similar measures to slow infection rates. Many organizations have\nresorted to mandating employees to work from home, which has resulted in these organizations seeking out video\ncommunication solutions like ours to keep employees as productive as possible, even while working from home.\nSchools, colleges, and universities globally have also closed as a result of this pandemic. Many of these\ninstitutions are utilizing our platform to provide remote instruction to their students. To help teachers and\nstudents navigate this unprecedented situation, we have temporarily removed the 40-minute time limit for meetings\nwith more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 domains worldwide.\nWhile we have experienced a significant increase in paid hosts and revenue due to the pandemic, the aforementioned\nfactors have also driven increased usage of our services and have required us to expand our network, data storage,\nand processing capacity, both in our own co-located data centers as well as through third-party cloud hosting,\nwhich has resulted, and is continuing to result, in an increase in our operating costs. Furthermore, a significant\nportion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free Basic accounts and our removal of the time\nlimit for school domains, which do not generate any revenue, but still require us to incur these additional\noperating costs to expand our capacity. Therefore, the recent increase in usage of our platform has adversely\nimpacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our gross margin.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or that new or existing users\nwill continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has tapered. Moreover, the tapering of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, particularly as vaccinations become widely available, may result in a decline in paid hosts and\nusers once individuals are no longer working or attending school from home.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or\nthe future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and\nmarketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who\nare able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger enterprise customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or\ngeography, before rolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have\ndeployed our platform globally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in\nthe use of our platform also provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our\ncustomers, such as Zoom Phone, Zoom HaaS, Zoom for Home, Zoom Rooms at each office location, and Zoom Video\nWebinars. In order for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing\ncustomers, we will need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that\nare responsive to our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion\nrate includes the increase in user adoption within our customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven\nby the number of paid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our\nsubscription revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion\nrate as of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all customers with more than 10\nemployees as of 12 months prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of\nsubscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring\nrevenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription\nagreements from all customers for the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers\n46\nTable of Contents\nwho have not provided any indication that they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from\nthese customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and\nattrition. We divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For\nthe trailing 12-months calculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12\nmonths. Our net dollar expansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of\npenetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers.\nOur trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate in customers with more than 10 employees was greater than 130% as\nof January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, and Zoom Video\nWebinars. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of Zoom for Home, a solution designed for\nthe home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible hardware. We also expanded our geographic\nfootprint with Zoom Phone availability in 26 new countries and territories during fiscal year 2021, bringing the\ntotal to 44. Third-party developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it\neasier for customers and developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as\nmore developers and other third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will\nbecome the ubiquitous platform for communications. We will need to expend additional resources to continue\nintroducing new products, features, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the\nvalue of our platform with their own applications.\nAn End-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is now available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host\nmeetings with up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings\nby default, but with Zoom’s new E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography\nto distribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nWe recently announced two additions to the Zoom platform: OnZoom and Zoom Apps. OnZoom is an online event platform\nfor Zoom users to create and host free, paid, and fundraising events. OnZoom is currently offered as a public beta\nfor U.S. users to attend online events. Zoom Apps are a new app type coming soon to the Zoom App Marketplace. These\nin-product integrations will be accessible directly from Zoom Meetings and the Zoom Desktop client and are designed\nto facilitate collaboration and engagement during meetings.\nInternational Expansion\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 31%, 19%, and 18% of our total revenue\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in\nfurther select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in certain\ninternational markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for our\nplatform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nCustomers with More Than 10 Employees\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our\ncustomer base, which includes organizations of all sizes across industries. We define a customer as a separate and\ndistinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size (including a distinct unit\nof an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. To better distinguish business customers from our broader\ncustomer base, we review the number of customers with more than 10 employees. As of January 31, 2021, 2020, and\n2019, we had approximately 467,100, 81,900, and 50,800 customers, respectively, with more than 10 employees. When\ndisclosing the number of customers, we round down to the nearest hundred.\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic early this fiscal year, our customer cohort with 10 or fewer employees\nexpanded as business owners and individual users adopted Zoom for many personal, professional, and social events.\nAs a result, we have experienced a shift in the makeup of customer cohorts, with 36% of revenue attributable to\ncustomers with 10 or fewer employees during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to 18% for the prior\nfiscal year.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as a\nmeasure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from these\ncustomers represented 20%, 33%, and 30% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and\n2019, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had 1,644, 641, and 344 customers, respectively,\nthat contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger\norganizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of the customers with more than 10 employees.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”), a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metric, may calculate this metric differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP metric as\na comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021           2020          2019\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating           $               1,471,177    $   151,892    $   51,332\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                            -79,972        -38,084       -28,432\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                $               1,391,205    $   113,808    $   22,900\nNet cash used in investing activities    $              -1,562,420    $  -499,468    $  -39,719\nNet cash provided by financing           $               2,050,277    $   615,690    $   17,534\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications\nplatform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also provide\nservices, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are generally\nconsidered distinct from the access to our unified communications platform.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, third-\nparty cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized\nsoftware development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost\nof revenue to increase in absolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year, as we expand our data center capacity\ndue to increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue\nmay decrease over time as we scale our data centers to accommodate usage from our increased customer base and as\nthe ratio of free to paid users varies.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research\nand development for the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing research and development headcount, as we focus\non further developing our platform, enhancing its use cases, and strengthening security and privacy. As a result,\nwe expect our research and development expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total\nrevenue, during the upcoming fiscal year.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of deferred contract\nacquisition costs and credit card processing fees related to sales. We plan to increase our investment in sales and\nmarketing over the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing the headcount of our direct sales force and\nmarketing investments in demand generation. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase\nboth in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue, during the upcoming fiscal year.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance,\nlegal, and human resources organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting\nservices; expected credit losses; insurance; indirect taxes; and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the size\nof our general and administrative function to support the growth and complexity of our business. As a result, we\nexpect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively constant\nas a percentage of total revenue, during the upcoming fiscal year.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion earned on our marketable\nsecurities, effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestment.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions\nwhere we conduct business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such

D ue to the COVID-19 pandemic, t here was an increase in usage of our services, as\nmany organizations around the world started utilizing our platform to continue their operations remotely. As a\nresult, the increase in revenue was primarily due to subscription services provided to new customers, which\naccounted for approximately 73% of the increase, and to subscription services provided to existing customers, which\naccounted for approximately 27% of the increase.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021             2020           $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nCost of revenue    $                            821,989       $  115,396       $    706,593         612  %\nGross profit                                  1,829,379          507,262          1,322,117         261  %\nGross margin                                         69  %            81  %\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased by $706.6 million, or 612%, compared to the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily removed the 40-minute\ntime limit for meetings with more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 school\ndomains worldwide . We also experienced a significant increase in usage from paid users as more companies started\nutilizing our platform to allow their employees to work remotely. This increase in usage resulted in an increase of\n$619.2 million in costs related to third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, and our co-\nlocated data centers to support the increase in customers and expanded use of our unified communications platform\nby existing customers. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of $59.3 million in personnel-\nrelated expenses mainly driven by additional headcount, which includes a $27.1 million increase in stock-based\ncompensation expense; an increase of $18.4 million in professional services mainly for customer support, and an\nincrease of $5.8 million related to subscription to software-based services.\nGross margin decreased to 69% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 from 81% for the fiscal year ended January\n31, 2020. The decrease in gross margin was due to higher incremental cost from leveraging third-party cloud hosting\nproviders to meet the significant increase in usage as well as the higher percentage of usage from free users.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021         2020       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nResearch and development    $                            164,080    $  67,079    $    97,001         145  %\nResearch and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased by $97.0 million, or 145%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.

The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of $68.4 million in credit card processing fees as\na result of increased online payments, an increase of $16.0 million in professional services primarily to support\nthe increase in sales, and an increase of $6.2 million related to subscription to software-based services,\npartially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million in marketing and sales event-related costs mainly due to a decrease\nin digital and awareness programs and trade shows.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021         2020       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nGeneral and administrative    $                            320,547    $  86,841    $   233,706         269  %\nGeneral and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased by $233.7 million, or 269%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.

Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be\nsufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription\nrenewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and\nresearch and development efforts, as well as expenses associated with our international expansion, and the timing\nand extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces as well as data center\ninfrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,\nservices, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or\ndebt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to\nraise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021           2020          2019\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating           $               1,471,177    $   151,892    $   51,332\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $              -1,562,420    $  -499,468    $  -39,719\nNet cash provided by financing           $               2,050,277    $   615,690    $   17,534\nactivities\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscriptions to our platform. Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,471.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared\nto $151.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an\nincrease in net income of $647.0 million, the positive impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities of\n$332.1 million, and an increase in non-cash adjustments of $340.2 million, which is primarily a result of higher\nstock-based compensation expense, higher deferred contract acquisition cost amortization due to an increase in\ncapitalized commissions as we continue to grow and expand our customer base, higher provision for accounts\nreceivable allowances due to higher accounts receivable balances, and expenses related to a charitable donation of\ncommon stock in the current fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,562.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $1,438.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $80.0\nmillion, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $26.5 million, purchase of an equity investment of\n$8.0 million, purchases of intangible assets of $5.8 million, and purchase of a convertible note of $5.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $499.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $456.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $38.1\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2,050.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was due to\nproceeds from our follow-on offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, of\n$1,979.2\n53\nTable of Contents\nmillion, proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $38.4\nmillion, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $28.6 million, and proceeds from international employee\nstock sales to be remitted to employees and tax authorities of $4.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $615.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was due to\nproceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO and private placement, net of\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, of $542.5 million, proceeds from international\nemployee stock sales to be remitted to employees and tax authorities of $48.5 million, proceeds from issuance of\ncommon stock pursuant to our ESPP of $15.5 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of\nrepurchases, of $9.2 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $         121,980    $                 19,949    $   41,623    $  35,600    $     24,808\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         498,626                     219,217       271,721        7,688               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         620,606    $                239,166    $  313,344    $  43,288    $     24,808\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in\nthe table above. See the “Future minimum lease payments” table in Note 7 and “Non-cancelable Purchase Obligations”\nin Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and estimates that are both the most\nimportant to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective\nor complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates\nwhere the nature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account\nfor highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on\nfinancial condition or operating performance is material.\nThe critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue\nrecognition through the following steps:\n54\nTable of Contents\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications platform, which consists of one or more software-based services. Our customers do not\nhave the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we provide a series of\ndistinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a professional\nmanner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service-level\ncommitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those\ncustomers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form\nof variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications platform and\nrelated services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nContract Balances\nWe receive payments from customers based on a billing schedule as established in our customer contracts. Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the contract may occur before invoicing to the customer resulting in an\nunbilled accounts receivable.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances are recognized during\nthe following 12-month period.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is recognized based on the fair value of the awards\ngranted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nfair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of\nour common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions\nused to determine the fair value of the option awards\n56\nTable of Contents\nrepresent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years. We account for forfeitures as they occur\ninstead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nAs noted above, our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective\nassumptions. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be\nmaterially different for the current period and in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input\nfrom management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation specialists. Stock-based compensation for\nfinancial reporting purposes is measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as when\nadditional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available in a valuation report issued as of a\nsubsequent date. After our IPO, the fair value of common stock for each grant date was determined based on the\nclosing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the respective grant.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be\noutstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to\nestimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the\nexpected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of\nthe time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For stock options granted to non-employees, the\nexpected term equals the contractual term of the option.\nExpected Volatility. As we have a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was\nestimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public\ncompanies in our industry, which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a\nperiod equivalent to the expected term of the awards.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our IPO, the fair value of our business, or enterprise value, was determined\nusing either the market approach or a combination of the market and income approaches. The market approach\nestimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of\nbusiness and secondary transactions of our capital stock. From the comparable companies, a representative market\nvalue multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company’s financial results to estimate the value of\nthe subject company. The market approach also includes consideration of the transaction price of secondary sales of\nour capital stock by investors. The income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present\nvalue of our future estimated cash flows and our residual value beyond the forecast period. These future cash\nflows, including the cash flows beyond the forecast period for the residual value, are discounted to their present\nvalues using an appropriate discount rate, to reflect the risks inherent in us achieving these estimated cash\nflows.\nThe resulting equity value is then allocated to each class of stock using an Option Pricing Model (“OPM”). The OPM\ntreats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based\non the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common stock is modeled as a call option with\na claim on the equity value at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible\npreferred stock is liquidated. The exclusive reliance on the OPM through July 31, 2018 was appropriate when the\nrange of possible future outcomes was difficult to predict and resulted in a highly speculative forecast. Beginning\nin October 2018, we performed the equity allocation using a probability weighted expected return method (“PWERM”).\nThe PWERM involves the estimation of the value of our company under multiple future potential outcomes, and\nestimates the probability of each potential outcome. The per share value of our common stock when determined using\nthe PWERM was ultimately based upon probability-weighted per share values resulting from the various future\nscenarios, which include an IPO, merger or sale, or continued operation as a private company. After the equity\nvalue was determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”)\nwas applied to arrive at the fair value of common stock on a non-marketable basis. A DLOM is applied based on the\ntheory that as an owner of a private company stock, the stockholder has limited information and opportunities to\nsell this stock.\n57\nTable of Contents\nA market participant that would purchase this stock would recognize this risk and thereby require a higher rate of\nreturn, which would reduce the overall fair market value.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO on April 18, 2019, our assessments of the fair value of common stock for grant\ndates were based in part on the current available financial and operational information and the common stock value\nprovided in the most recent valuation as compared to the timing of each grant. For financial reporting purposes, we\nconsidered the amount of time between the valuation date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest\ncommon stock valuation or a straight-line interpolation between the two valuation dates. This determination\nincluded an evaluation of whether the subsequent valuation indicated that any significant change in valuation had\noccurred between the previous valuation and the grant date.\nFor valuation after our IPO, the fair value of common stock for each grant date was determined based on the closing\nprice of our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the respective\ngrant.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan Valuation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense related to our ESPP purchase rights based on the estimated grant\ndate fair value, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the aggregate number of\nshares of our common stock expected to be purchased under each offering. The assumptions used to determine the fair\nvalue of the ESPP purchase rights, including the expected term of the awards, the expected volatility of the price\nof our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, represent\nmanagement’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s\njudgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each\nESPP offering period, which is generally two years. We account for modifications to employee contributions as they\noccur.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. If factors\nchange and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for\nthe current period and in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the awards was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of the ESPP represents the period of time that purchase rights are expected to\nbe outstanding.\nExpected Volatility. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, as we\nhave a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average\nhistoric price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in our industry which are\neither similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term\nof the awards. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, expected\nvolatility was determined using a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock and\nhistorical volatility of our stock price.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.",

          "content": "Item 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a small amount\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in\nwhich we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, China, Europe, and Australia. Our\nresults of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates\napplicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. As the impact of\n58\nTable of Contents\nforeign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into\nderivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more\nsignificant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion and marketable securities of $2.0 billion as of January 31, 2021.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n59\nTable of Contents",

We also have audited the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting\nfor leases as of February 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases .\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions\n61\nTable of Contents\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $2,651\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2021.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts, and recalculated the amount of\nrevenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the arrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying\nperformance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by\nassessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nprovide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people\ninteract. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing and enable\nface-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and locations.\nWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2021.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, the allowance for credit\nlosses, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, stock-based\ncompensation expense, sales and other tax liabilities, the fair value of marketable securities, equity investment,\nconvertible promissory note, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and the valuation of deferred income tax\nassets and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions,\nand the extent of its impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments,\nincluding the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on our customers and our sales cycles. During the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and carried\na higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes\navailable, our estimates may change materially in future periods.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2021 or 2020. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases, corporate credit cards,\nand cash from proceeds from international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses\nand other current assets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $ 50.5million and $ 48.5million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe\n69\nTable of Contents\nemployees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January 31, 2021\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $                 331,547\nLess: Allowance for credit losses                      -20,500\nLess: Allowance for returns                            -16,344\nAccounts receivable, net             $                 294,703\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, our assessment considered business and market disruptions caused by\nCOVID-19 and estimates of credit and collectibility trends. The continued volatility in market conditions and\nevolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict, causing variability and volatility that may have a\nmaterial impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Below is a rollforward of our allowance for\ncredit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of January 31, 2020    $           5,150\nProvision for credit losses                  25,651\nWrite-offs                                  -10,301\nBalance as of January 31, 2021    $          20,500\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a component of stockholders’\nequity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair value were due\nto credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through allowance for credit\nlosses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized gains and losses from\nthe sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and\nlosses are reported in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n70\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications platform during the application\ndevelopment stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform\nthe function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net.\nCosts related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful\nlife, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of\noperations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We have capitalized $\n19.4million, $ 3.1million, and $ 2.5million of software development costs during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nLeases\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and applicable updates as of February 1,\n2019, using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the adoption date. Prior year\ncomparative financial information was not recast under the new standard and continues to be presented under\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840.\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present\nvalue of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as our leases generally do not\nprovide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a\ncollateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, less lease\n71\nTable of Contents\nincentives received. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs\nwithin our control. We currently do not have any finance leases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were no impairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have one reporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2021 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense of developed technology is recorded within cost of\nrevenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of\nour finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the\nremaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not\namortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine\nwhether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine\nthat the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and\namortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. There were no impairment charges to acquired\nintangible assets during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue\nrecognition through the following steps:\n72\nTable of Contents\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications platform, which consists of one or more software-based services. Our customers do not\nhave the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we provide a series of\ndistinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a professional\nmanner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service-level\ncommitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those\ncustomers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form\nof variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications platform and\nrelated services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 2% of total revenue during the periods presented.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located data center costs,\nthird-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of\ncapitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead\ncosts. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related depreciation is allocated to cost\nof revenue and operating expenses based on applicable headcount.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications platform,\ndepreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 34.8million, $\n42.0million, and $ 36.1million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), RSUs, and ESPP) is measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nfair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of\nour common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSA and RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant\ndate.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Foreign currency related gains and\nlosses have been immaterial during the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax\nliability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock,\n74\nTable of Contents\nwhich includes early exercised stock options and RSAs, to be participating securities as holders of such securities\nhave non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common stock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating\ndecision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below.

Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU No. 2019-10, and ASU\nNo. 2019-11 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard. ASU No. 2016-13 and the related updates\nreplace the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model, and requires a financial\nasset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. We adopted the\nstandard as of February 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the\nadoption date. Our adoption did not result in any cumulative effect adjustment in our consolidated financial\nstatements upon adoption as of February 1, 2020.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic\n350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service\nContract . The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting\narrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to\ndevelop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).\nWe adopted ASU No. 2018-15, prospectively, as of February 1, 2020, and our adoption did not have a material impact\non the consolidated financial statements.\n75\nTable of Contents\n2.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances in the consolidated balance sheets was $ 24.6million and $ 12.5million as of January 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 222.0million, $ 119.1million, and $\n50.3million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligation\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n1,750.9million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 883.5million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 867.4million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 70% of\nour remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded\nduring the periods presented.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition costs:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021          2020\n-in thousands\nBeginning balance                       $                  91,130    $   55,516\nAdditions to deferred contract                            307,068        72,715\nacquisition costs\nAmortization of deferred contract                        -104,306       -37,101\nacquisition costs\nEnding balance                          $                 293,892    $   91,130\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,\ncurrent (to be amortized in next 12     $                 136,630    $   44,885\nmonths)\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,                      157,262        46,245\nnoncurrent\nTotal deferred contract acquisition     $                 293,892    $   91,130\ncosts\n3.

We have elected to\nmeasure this investment, which does not have a readily determinable fair value, at its cost, minus impairment, if\nany, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a\nsimilar investment of the same issuer (i.e., using the measurement alternative). As of January 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe carrying amount of the equity investment was $ 13.5million and $ 3.0million, respectively. We classify the\nequity investment as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy only if an impairment or observable adjustment is\nrecognized during the period, as it is based on an observable transaction price at the transaction date and other\nunobservable inputs, such as volatility.\n5. Business Combinations\nOn May 7, 2020, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Keybase, Inc. (“Keybase”), a secure\nmessaging and file-sharing company, for purchase consideration of $ 42.9million in cash. The acquisition helps us\nstrengthen the security of our video communications platform by providing end-to-end encryption expertise. The\nacquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 24.3million was attributed to goodwill, $ 3.3million to intangible\nassets, and $ 15.3million to other net assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $\n16.4million. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing products expected to be realized from\nthe acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquired\nintangible assets consisted of developed technology with an estimated useful life of five years. The developed\ntechnology had a remaining useful life of 4.3years as of January 31, 2021, and is amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over its estimated useful life.\nNot included in the purchase consideration, we also entered into holdback agreements with certain employees for $\n20.0million in cash payments, which are subject to such employees’ continued service with us. The holdback amount\nof $ 20.0million will be treated as compensation for research and development over the required service period\nranging from oneto three years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial. The results of operations of Keybase\nhave been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Pro forma and\nhistorical results of operations of Keybase have not been presented, as the results do not have a material effect\non any of the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations.\n79\nTable of Contents\n6.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto 9years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our HaaS offering. As a practical\nexpedient, we account for HaaS with customers as a combined performance obligation with the right to access our\nunified communications platform under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our\nconsolidated financial statements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach\nmaturity, we consider various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist\nto determine whether we are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 14.5million and $ 9.7million , respectively, excluding\nshort-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was immaterial for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 . Rent expense was $ 7.2million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, u\nnder Topic 840.\n81\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\nReported as:                                               2021\nAssets:                                          (in thousands)                    2020\nOperating lease right-of-use assets        $             97,649               $  68,608\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other current         $             15,601               $   7,675\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent                  90,415                  64,792\nTotal operating lease liabilities          $            106,016               $  72,467\nWeighted average remaining lease term                            6.1 years               7.5 years\nWeighted average discount rate                              4.5  %                  5.1  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021         2020\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  13,717    $   9,774\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  39,918    $  34,993\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2021\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2022                                 $                  19,949\n2023                                                    21,313\n2024                                                    20,310\n2025                                                    20,216\n2026                                                    15,384\nThereafter                                              24,808\nTotal operating lease payments       $                 121,980\nLess: imputed interest                                 -15,964\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                 106,016\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of 12 months or longer of $ 498.6million.\nLicense Agreement\nIn May 2020, we entered into a license agreement with MPEGLA to obtain the rights for future use of licensed\nintellectual property in exchange for periodic royalty payments. In connection with the license agreement, we made\nan initial\n82\nTable of Contents\nroyalty payment of $ 9.8million to use the technology until December 31, 2020 and we made an additional payment of\n$ 9.8million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 to use the technology until December 31, 2021. Both payments\nwere amortized in cost of revenue on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statements of operations. For the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we recorded $ 10.6million of such costs. In addition, we made a one-time\npayment of $ 9.8million for past use, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated\nstatements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 85.6million and $ 37.7million, respectively, of which $ 27.5million and $ 3.7million\nare included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 58.1million and $ 34.0million\nare included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based on our best\nestimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of a probable\noutcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue subject to\nsales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant adjustments to the\nsales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for\nchanges to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in the future as\nwe obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nOther Contingencies\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s EAR and various economic and trade sanctions\nregulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). The U.S.\nexport control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of\ncertain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities, and\nalso require authorization for the export of certain encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the\nimport of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements and have\nenacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our hosts’\nability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in apparent violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently made\nour software products available to some customers, including users in embargoed or sanctioned countries, in\napparent violation of the EAR. As a result, we have submitted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures\nconcerning potential violations of U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to the OFAC and the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce’s BIS. In June 2019, OFAC and BIS issued us warning letters as their final enforcement\nresponses to these potential violations, but no fines or penalties were assessed. If we are found to be in\nviolation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result in fines and penalties.\nIn June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York “EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign\n83\nTable of Contents\npolitical parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user\ndata, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the\nTiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and\ninformation relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our\nstatements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition,\nthe NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the\nChinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies,\nprocedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional\nsubpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations\nand have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not\nknow when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or\nwhat actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a\nnegative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other\nfinancial exposure.\nLegal Proceedings\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions have been filed against us in various U.S. federal\ndistrict courts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data\nsharing with third parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). We have also been sued under the DC private attorney\ngeneral statute on behalf of members of the general public. The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state\nconsumer protection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims such as negligence\nand unjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs seek various forms of injunctive and\nmonetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\nfederal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the Northern District of California with our consent;\nlead plaintiffs’ counsel have been appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action\ncomplaint on October 28, 2020. We filed a motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated class action complaint\non December 2, 2020, which is pending ruling by the court, and the parties are presently engaged in discovery, with\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification due on June 25, 2021.\nOn April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our\nofficers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs are purported\nstockholders of the Company. The complaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of\nmaterial fact about our data privacy and security measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest,\nfees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead\nplaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The response to the complaint\nis currently stayed while the court considers a motion for reconsideration regarding its lead plaintiff\nappointment.\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is\nstayed pending resolution of a forthcoming motion to dismiss the securities class action.\nWe believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the\nuncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among\nother things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss that may result from these actions.\nIn September 2019, the FTC issued a CID to us requiring us to produce certain documents and materials and to answer\ncertain interrogatories relating to our privacy and security representations and practices. Since then, we have\nfully cooperated with the investigation. In October 2020, we reached a proposed settlement agreement with the FTC\nstaff, which would resolve the FTC’s allegations that certain of our statements and practices about our security\nconstituted deceptive and unfair acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. On November 10, 2020, the FTC\nCommissioners voted to approve the settlement and, on November 13, 2020, the FTC published the settlement in the\nFederal Register for a 30-day public comment period, which ended on December 13, 2020. On January 19, 2021, the FTC\nvoted to finalize the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement, we neither admit nor deny the FTC’s\nallegations, and the FTC does not impose any fine or penalty upon us. We are required to implement certain\ninjunctive provisions, including, among other things, refraining from making any misrepresentations\n84\nTable of Contents\nregarding the privacy and security of our services or how we collect, maintain, use, delete, disclose, allow access\nto, and protect user information. It also requires us to implement a detailed information security program and\nobtain third-party security assessments periodically.\nWe do not expect the settlement to have a material impact on our financial results. We will cooperate with the\nFTC’s requirements and work to ensure compliance. Any failure to comply with the settlement may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources, all of which could result in a material loss or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n9. Convertible Preferred Stock, Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit), and Equity Incentive Plans\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nUpon completion of the IPO in April 2019, all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding, totaling\n152,665,804shares, were automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock on a\none-to-one basis and their carrying value of $ 159.6million was reclassified into stockholders’ equity. As of\nJanuary 31, 2021 and 2020, there were noshares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nIn connection with the IPO, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which\nauthorized the issuance of 200,000,000shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001with rights\nand preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors.\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into one share of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that is authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nEquity Financing\nOn April 23, 2019, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 9,911,434shares of our Class A common stock at\n$ 36.00per share. On April 18, 2019, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional\n3,130,435shares of our Class A common stock at $ 36.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 447.9million,\nnet of underwriters’ discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO:\nall of the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of\n152,665,804shares of Class B common stock;\n85\nTable of Contents\noutstanding convertible promissory notes and accrued interest automatically converted into 426,223shares of Class\nA common stock based on the IPO price of $ 36.00per share; and\nSalesforce Ventures LLC purchased 2,777,777shares of Class A common stock from us at $ 36.00per share in a\nconcurrent private placement. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 100.0million and did not pay any underwriting\ndiscounts or commissions with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in this private\nplacement.\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees related to our IPO. Prior to the\nIPO, all deferred offering costs were capitalized in other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAfter the IPO, $ 6.4million of deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders’ equity (deficit) as a\nreduction of the IPO proceeds in the consolidated balance sheets. We capitalized $ 2.4million of deferred offering\ncosts within other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, which were\nreclassified into additional paid-in capital upon the completion of the IPO.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 5,882,353shares of our\nClass A common stock, including 735,294shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase\nadditional shares, at $ 340.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 1,980.0million, net of underwriters’\ndiscounts and commissions. The other related offering costs were immaterial.\nCommon Stock\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2021          2020\nStock options outstanding                        9,239,504    16,833,009\nRSUs outstanding                                 4,510,730     1,964,668\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                   724,883     1,323,662\nRemaining shares available for future           44,584,783    33,604,587\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future            9,648,574     7,186,070\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock            68,708,474    60,911,996\nreserved\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock that may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not\nexceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the sum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an\nadditional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of (A) shares that remain available for the\nissuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time our 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B)\nshares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or other stock awards granted under our 2011\nPlan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or expire prior to exercise or settlement; are\nnot issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because of the failure to vest; or are reacquired or\nwithheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or the purchase or exercise price, if any, as such\nshares become available from time to time. In addition, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under our 2019 Plan automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar year, starting on February\n1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock\n(both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase\nor (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors prior to the applicable February 1.\n86\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nStock Options\nOutstanding                    Weighted-\nStock       Weighted-    Average\nOptions         Average    Remaining               Aggregate\n(in thousands, except share,        Exercise    Contractual             Intrinsic\nlife and per share data)           Price    Life (Years)                Value\nBalance as of January 31,                       16,833,009    $       5.73                  7.6    $  1,191,881\n2020\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                       -7,378,477    $       3.87                         $  1,786,657\nCanceled/forfeited/expired                        -215,028    $       8.05\nBalance as of January 31,                        9,239,504    $       7.17                  7.0    $  3,371,457\n2021\nVested and exercisable as\nof January 31,                                   4,641,908    $       3.98                  6.6    $  1,708,663\n2021\nThere were nooptions granted for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.The weighted-average grant date fair value\nof options granted to employees during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 25.17and $ 6.28,\nrespectively. The intrinsic value of the options exercised, which represents the difference between the fair market\nvalue of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option, was $ 1,786.7million, $\n767.3million, and $ 60.8million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of\nJanuary 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options was $\n46.7million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4years.\nThe Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options at the grant dates are as follows:\nYear ended January\n31,                   2020            2019\nExpected term (years)                            5.0-6.1         5.0-6.2\nExpected volatility                              49.9% -53.2%    44.6% -48.2%\nRisk-free interest rate                          1.6% -2.5%      2.6% -3.1%\nExpected dividend yield                          —               —\nThese assumptions and estimates were determined as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input\nfrom management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation specialists. Stock-based compensation for\nfinancial reporting purposes is measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as when\nadditional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available in a valuation report issued as of a\nsubsequent date. After our initial public offering, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock was\nbased on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the grant.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be\noutstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to\nestimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the\nexpected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of\nthe time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock options. For stock options granted to nonemployees, the\nexpected term equals the contractual term of the stock option.\nExpected Volatility. As we have a short trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was\nestimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public\ncompanies in our industry that are similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period\nequivalent to the expected term of the awards.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\n87\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of RSU activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nRSUs\nUnvested                      Weighted-Average\nRSUs       Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nUnvested as of January 31, 2020    1,964,668    $                            79.11\nGranted                            3,351,979    $                           241.32\nVested                              -625,163    $                            86.29\nCanceled/forfeited                  -180,754    $                           181.18\nUnvested as of January 31, 2021    4,510,730    $                           194.57\nAs of January 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested RSUs was $\n734.6million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7years.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 ESPP, which became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, 923,553and\n490,268shares, respectively, of our Class A common stock were purchased under the ESPP.\nAs of January 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $ 31.9million, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.4years.\nWe estimated the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nYear ended January 31,\n2021                      2020\nExpected term (years)      0.5-2.1                   0.5-2.1\nExpected volatility        40.3% -75.0%              40.3% -56.2%\nRisk-free interest rate    0.1% -2.5%                1.5% -2.5%\nExpected dividend yield    —                         —\nShares Reserved for Charitable Donations\nDuring fiscal year 2020, our board of directors approved the issuance of 500,000shares of Class A common stock for\nthe sole purpose of being transferred to nonprofit organizations.

In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning\nstrategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations. If we determine\nthat we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we\nwould make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income\ntaxes. Management believes it is more likely than not that some deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAccordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded on U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2021\nand 2020. The valuation allowance increased $ 298.7million and $ 35.5million during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was primarily attributable to net operating losses generated as a result of\nstock-based compensation windfall benefits. The valuation allowance decreased $ 2.3million during the fiscal year\nended January 31, 2019 and was primarily attributable to deferred tax liabilities generated from the capitalization\nof commissions for GAAP purposes.\n90\nTable of Contents\nWe intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and U.K. until\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. In our valuation\nallowance evaluation, we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified than to evidence that cannot\nbe objectively verified. Our consideration of the evidence requires management to make a number of significant\njudgments, estimates, and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters. Given our current\nearnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that in the foreseeable\nfuture, sufficient positive evidence may become available that results in a conclusion that a portion of the\nvaluation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of\ncertain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However,\nthe exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of\nprofitability (pretax income adjusted for permanent differences) that we are able to actually achieve.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1,264.3million for federal\nincome tax purposes, a small portion of which will begin to expire in 2032 if unused. We had net operating loss\ncarryforwards of approximately $ 797.0million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year\n2027 if unused. We also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 34.1million, which have an\nindefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 13.6million\nfor federal income tax and $ 11.4million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development tax\ncredit will begin to expire in 2036 if unused. State research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382\nand Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. The Tax Reform Act of\n1986 contains provisions that limit the federal net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year\nin the event of special occurrences, including significant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382\nreview and determined that none of our operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n(in thousands)\nBalance - January 31, 2018                 $                      1,976\nIncreases related to current year’s tax                             802\npositions\nBalance - January 31, 2019                                        2,778\nIncreases related to current year’s tax                           5,328\npositions\nBalance - January 31, 2020                                        8,106\nIncreases related to current year’s tax                           6,001\npositions\nIncreases related to prior year’s tax                               314\npositions\nCurrent year acquisitions                                           885\nLapse of statute of limitations                                    -422\nBalance - January 31, 2021                 $                     14,884\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, are $ 2.0million, $\n2.0million, and $ 1.0million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax\nrate.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. During the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2021, we recognized interest and penalties of $ 0.1million, and had a cumulative liability\nof $ 0.2million as of January 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, we recognized interest and\npenalties of $ 0.3million, and had a cumulative liability of $ 0.3million as of January 31, 2020. During the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2019, we recognized nointerest and penalties.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2021, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\n91\nTable of Contents\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was passed into law. On December 27,\n2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (2021) was passed into law. Both amended portions of relevant tax law and\ndid not have a significant impact on the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. We\nwill continue to monitor future guidance regarding these acts and other similar stimulus measures to determine any\nfuture impacts.\n11.

          "content": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2021 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n93\nTable of Contents\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The\ndesign of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future\nevents, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all\npotential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the\ndegree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
