                                 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                 
                                                                                                                   
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other
than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding
our future results of operations or financial condition; business strategy and plans; and objectives of management
for future operations, including our statements regarding the benefits and timing of the roll out of new
technology, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they
contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these
words or other similar terms or expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: our future financial performance, including our revenue,
cost of revenue, gross profit, margins, and operating expenses; trends in our key business metrics; the sufficiency
of our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash provided by sales of our products and services to meet our
liquidity needs; market trends; our market position and opportunity; our growth strategy and business aspirations
for our communications platform; our product strategy; our efforts to enhance the security and privacy of our
platform; the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic recovery and related public health measures on our
business, the business of our customers, suppliers and channel partners, and the economy; our ability to become the
ubiquitous platform for communications; our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers; our
ability to successfully expand into our existing markets and into new markets; our ability to effectively manage
our growth and future expenses; and the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-
looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and
projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and
operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks,
uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and
uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that
could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The
results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and
actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant
subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may
be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive
inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are
cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.

The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on
which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not
actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should
not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the
potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments.

You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and events and
circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

Investing in our Class A common stock involves numerous risks, including the risks described in “Part II—Other
Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Below are some of these risks, any one
of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

• Our business depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and upsell additional products and new
product categories to existing customers, and upgrade free users to our paid offerings. Any decline in new
customers, renewals, or upgrades would harm our business.

• While we continue to add paid users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or
decline as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to taper, particularly as users return to work or school
or are otherwise no longer subject to limitations on in-person meetings.

• Our revenue growth rate has begun to decline, and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in
future periods.

• Interruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors
would impair the delivery of our services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.

• We operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively. Many of our actual and potential
competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating
histories; more varied products and services; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing relationships;
more third-party integration; greater accessibility across devices or applications; greater access to larger user
bases; major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical,
and other resources. In addition, as we introduce new products and services, and with the introduction of new
technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.

• Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users
to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors,
or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform.

• As we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater
deployment challenges.

• We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or
for communications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.

• We expect to continue to increase our expenses in the future, which could decrease our profitability or prevent
us from maintaining profitability.

• We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform or develop new features.

• Our security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security
measures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,
expose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products
and services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or
ceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.

• We have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our prospects and future results of operations.

• The actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners, or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving
privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual
obligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.

• If we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we
may not be able to execute our business strategy.

• We have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased
business, regulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.

• We may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws
that could result in claims, increase the cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the
laws,
                                                         4

changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with
the laws.

• Zoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the
future may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to
comply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.

• The dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to
our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates,
limiting your ability to influence corporate matters.

If we are unable to adequately address these and other risks we face, our business may be harmed.

Description of Business

Zoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
connect people through our core unified communications offering, which frictionlessly brings together video, phone,
chat, webinars events, and contact center, and enables meaningful experiences across disparate devices and
locations. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose,
California.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2023.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and applicable regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting, and include the accounts of Zoom
Video Communications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and variable interest entities for which we are the primary
beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2022 included herein was derived from the audited
financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by
GAAP on an annual reporting basis. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal
recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of
comprehensive income, statements of stockholders’ equity, and statements of cash flows for the interim periods, but
are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for the full fiscal year or any
future period.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January
31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2022.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions
include, but are not limited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, the
useful lives of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, stock-based compensation
expense, sales and other tax liabilities, the fair value of marketable securities and strategic investments,
acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions,
and accruals and contingencies. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1. “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting
Policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended January 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2022. There have been no significant changes to these
policies during the three months ended April 30, 2022.

Contract Balances

We receive payments from customers based on a billing schedule as established in our customer contracts. Accounts
receivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to
consideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting
in an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,
net of allowances on the condensed consolidated balance sheets was $ 68.6million and $ 59.7million as of April 30,
2022 and January 31, 2022, respectively.

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance
of performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the
next 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each
period was $ 541.6million and $ 419.1million during the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Remaining Performance Obligations

The terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear, and we may bill for the full term in
advance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of April
30, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $
2,990.0million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,331.0million and unbilled
consideration in the amount of $ 1,659.0million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 63%
of our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.

Unrealized losses for securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months were $
58.2million as of April 30, 2022 and $ 23.3million as of January 31, 2022. Unrealized losses for securities that
have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer were immaterial as of April 30, 2022 and January
31, 2022. We review the individual securities that have unrealized losses on a regular basis to evaluate whether or
not any security has experienced, or is expected to experience, credit losses resulting in the decline in fair
value. We evaluate, among other factors, whether we have the intention to sell any of these marketable securities
and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any of them before recovery of the
amortized cost basis. We have not recorded an allowance for credit losses, as we believe any such losses would be
immaterial based on the high-grade credit rating for each of our marketable securities as of the end of each
period. There were no material realized gains or losses from available-for-sale securities that were reclassified
out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021.

We classify our highly liquid money market funds and publicly held equity securities within Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy because they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. We classify our commercial
paper, agency bonds, corporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills, and
certificates of deposit within Level 2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted prices that are
directly or indirectly observable in the market, including readily available pricing sources for the identical
underlying security, which may not be actively traded. We classify our privately held debt securities as Level 3
due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, such as the probability weighting of the
various scenarios that can impact settlement of the arrangement.

Non-cancelable Purchase Obligations

During the three months ended April 30, 2022, there have been no material changes to our non-cancelable purchase
obligations from those disclosed in Note 8. “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on
March 7, 2022.

Other Contingencies

In June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern
District of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and
foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access
to user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to
the Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and
information relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our
statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition,
the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the
Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies,
procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional
subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations
and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not
know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or
what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a
negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other
financial exposure.

Legal Proceedings

On April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our
officers in the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of the
Company. The complaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
and Rule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about our data privacy and
security measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions
were consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead
plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on May 20, 2021.
Plaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the motion to
dismiss was filed on August 9, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our
motion to dismiss. On March 14, 2022, we moved for reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss.
On March 22, 2022, the court ordered plaintiff to respond to our motion, which Plaintiff did on March 29, 2022. On
April 22, 2022, we answered the complaint.

On June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and
directors, and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal
claims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits
accuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,
policies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as
well as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is
stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On October 27, 2021, a third
substantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified
monetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated and
remain stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action.

We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the
uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among
other things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss that may result from these actions.

Beginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in various U.S. federal district
courts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with
third parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state consumer
protection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims, such as negligence and
unjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of
individuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs seek various forms of injunctive and
monetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. The
federal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the NDCA with our consent; lead plaintiffs’ counsel have
been appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint on October 28, 2020.
On March 11, 2021, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss, and gave plaintiffs leave
to amend. On July 30, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs to settle the action on a
classwide basis, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the court on July
31, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement,
we have paid $ 85.0million into an escrow account that will be used to pay claims filed by settlement class
members, attorneys’ fees and expenses, administrative costs, and service payments to plaintiffs. On April 21, 2022,
the Court granted final approval of the settlement. On May 19, 2022, two objectors to the settlement appealed the
Court's final approval order.

In addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course
of business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,
if determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can
impose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings
in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.

We compute our provision for income taxes by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date
ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the period. In each quarter, we update
the estimated annual effective tax rate and make a year-to-date adjustment to the provision. The estimated annual
effective tax rate is subject to significant volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately
predict the proportion of our pretax income in multiple jurisdictions and certain book-tax differences.
The following table provides details of the provision for income taxes:

The provision for income taxes was $ 30.0million and $ 1.4million for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and
2021, respectively. The year-over-year increase in effective tax rate for the three-month period ended April 30,
2022 was due primarily to the valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2021, which was
released in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. For the three months ended April 30, 2022, the effective tax
rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to stock-based compensation for tax purposes,
offset by research credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. For the three months ended April
30, 2021, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the valuation
allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets.

The realization of tax benefits of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon future levels of taxable income, of an
appropriate character, in the periods the items are expected to be deductible or taxable. Based on the available
objective evidence during the three months ended April 30, 2022, we continue to believe that it is more likely than
not that the tax benefits of the U.K. net deferred tax assets may not be realized. Accordingly, we maintained a
full valuation allowance against the tax benefits of these net deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain the full
valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the
valuation allowance.

During the three months ended April 30, 2022, there were no material changes to the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits and we do not expect any significant changes in the next 12 months.

As required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are capitalizing research and development expenses incurred in
fiscal year 2023. These expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic research and fifteen
years for international research. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities but
also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The cash
flow impact will decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together
with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these
forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk
Factors” and in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

   Overview                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.

Zoom enables people to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their
imagination. Our frictionless communications platform started with video as its foundation, and we have set the
standard for innovation ever since. We connect people through our core unified communications offering, which
frictionlessly brings together phone, chat, video, whiteboarding, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences
across disparate devices and locations. Our Developer Platform enables customers, developers, and service providers
to easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-leading video communications platform, with
opportunities for global discovery and distribution. Our virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to
seamlessly create and manage engaging events. Our Contact Center is an omnichannel contact center solution that is
optimized for video and integrated right into the Zoom client.

We believe that face-to-face communications build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our
customers place in us by delivering a communications solution while prioritizing their privacy and security. Our 27
co-located data centers worldwide and the public cloud in conjunction with our proprietary adaptive rate codec
enable us to provide both high-quality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth
environments.

We generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications platform. Subscription revenue is
driven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products, including Rooms,
Webinars, Phone, Events, Contact Center, and Hardware-as-a-Service (“HaaS”) for rooms and phones. A host is any
user of our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to
join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We define a
customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid user or host or an organization of
any size (including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Basic offering is free
and gives hosts access to Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that meetings time-out at 40
minutes. Our paid offerings include our Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education, and Healthcare plans, which provide
incremental features and functionality, such as different participant limits, administrative controls, and
reporting.

For Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the
Bring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer
Regional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in three specific markets (United States/Canada, United
Kingdom/Ireland, and Australia/New Zealand). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,
which allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in more than 45 countries and territories
where Zoom has local public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) coverage.

Our revenue was $1,073.8 million and $956.2 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, representing period-over-period growth of 12%. We had net income of $113.7 million and $227.5 million
for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$526.2 million and $533.3 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
                                                                                                                   
  Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
We continue to monitor the actual and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across our business. The extent
and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments including the
duration and spread of the virus and its variant strains; the availability; distribution and adoption of effective
vaccines; the severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and the timing, nature and
sustainability of economic recovery; and government responses, including vaccination or testing mandates, all of
which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.

During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations resorted to mandating employees to work from home,
which has resulted in these organizations seeking out video communication solutions like ours to keep employees as
productive as possible, even while working from home. There is no assurance that we will experience an increase in
paid hosts or that new or existing users will continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has
tapered globally. Moreover, the tapering of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in a decline in paid hosts and users
once individuals are no longer working or attending school from home.

As of April 30, 2022, many of our employees have returned to our offices for at least part of the week. Our return
to work approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols, and may change at any time
depending on the severity of or spikes in COVID-19 cases. The impact, if any, of these and any additional
operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but changes we have implemented have not affected and are not
expected to affect our ability to

We are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its global impacts, including
various sanctions and export restrictions on Russia and Belarus by the United States, the United Kingdom, the
European Union, and other governmental authorities. While the war is still evolving and the outcome remains highly
uncertain, we believe the Russia-Ukraine war may have some impact on our business and results of operations.
However, if the Russia-Ukraine war continues or worsens, leading to additional sanctions, tightened export
restrictions, and greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of operations could
be materially impacted. Our customers in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine represented an immaterial portion of our net
assets and total consolidated revenue as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2022.

  Acquiring New Customers                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
We are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and
growth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a
significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or
the future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and
marketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who
are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.

Expansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers

We believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have
increased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.
Some of our larger customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or geography, before
rolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have deployed our platform
globally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of our platform
also provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers, such as Phone, HaaS,
Zoom for Home, Rooms at each office location, Developer Platform solutions, Events, Contact Center, and Webinars.
In order for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing customers, we will
need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that are responsive to
our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.

We quantify our expansion across existing Enterprise customers through our net dollar expansion rate. We define
Enterprise customers as distinct business units who have been engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers,
or strategic partners. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the increase in user adoption within our Enterprise
customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven by the number of paid hosts within a customer and the
purchase of additional products, and compares our subscription revenue from the same set of Enterprise customers
across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion rate as of a period end by starting with the annual
recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all Enterprise customers as of 12 months prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR
as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate
ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring
revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all Enterprise customers for the last month of the period,
including revenue from monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication that they intend to cancel their
subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these Enterprise customers as of the current period end (“Current
Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and attrition. We divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior
Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For the trailing 12-months calculation, we take an average
of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12 months. Our net dollar expansion rate may fluctuate as a
result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of products
and features, and our ability to retain our Enterprise customers. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate
for Enterprise customers was 123% as of April 30, 2022 and greater than 130% as of April 30, 2021.
                                                                                                                   
  Innovation and Expansion of Our Platform                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
We continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently
introduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Phone, Meetings, Webinars, and Events and
launched Zoom Contact Center and Whiteboard. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of
Zoom for Home, a solution designed for the home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible
hardware. We also

expanded our geographic footprint with Zoom Phone availability to more than 45 countries and territories as of
April 30, 2022. Third-party developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it
easier for customers and developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as
more developers and other third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will
become the ubiquitous platform for communications. We will need to expend additional resources to continue
introducing new products, features, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the
value of our platform with their own applications.

An end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings
with up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by
default, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to
distribute these keys to the other meeting participants.

In February 2022, we launched Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for
video and integrated right into the Zoom client. Currently, Zoom Contact Center is available in the U.S. and
Canada, with plans to introduce international availability later in 2022. In April 2022, we released Zoom
Whiteboard, a persistent whiteboard tool for team collaboration in and outside of meetings, and Zoom IQ for Sales,
a conversation intelligence software for Zoom Meetings, which provides sales teams with meaningful and actionable
insights from their customer interactions to improve seller performance and enhance customer experiences.
                                                                                                                   
  International Expansion                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
Our platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major
opportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 32% and 34% of our total revenue for
the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in further select
international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in certain international markets
where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for our platform will continue to
increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally
will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the particular challenges of
supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and
regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.
                                                                                                                   
   Key Business Metrics                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
We have historically reviewed the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends,
formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions.
                                                                                                                   
  Number of Enterprise Customers                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
We believe that our ability to increase the number of Enterprise customers is an indicator of our potential future
business opportunities, the growth of our business, and an indicator of our market penetration. Increasing
awareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of our technology, has expanded
the diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, we
expect Enterprise customers to represent a larger share of our business. As of April 30, 2022 and 2021, we had
approximately 198,900 and 160,300 Enterprise customers, respectively.

Customers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue

We focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it
is a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from
these customers represented 24% and 19% of total revenue for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. As of April 30, 2022 and 2021, we had 2,916 and 1,999 customers, respectively, that contributed more
than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger organizations, including
enterprises. These customers are a subset of Enterprise customers.
                                                                                                                   
   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) and adjusted
free cash flow (“Adjusted FCF”), a non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in evaluating our liquidity.
                                                                                                                   
  Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
We define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We define
Adjusted FCF as FCF plus litigation settlement payments, net. We add back litigation settlement payments, net
because they are not part of our ongoing operating activities, and the consideration of measures that exclude such
payments can assist in the comparison of cash generated from operations in different periods which may or may not
include such payments and assist in
                                                        24

the comparison with the results of other companies in the industry. We believe that FCF and Adjusted FCF are useful
indicators of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated
from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for future growth. FCF and
Adjusted FCF are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as an analytical tool,
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as
net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including companies in our
industry, may not use these metrics, may calculate these metrics differently, or may use other financial measures
to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP metrics as a comparative
measure.

The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented and a reconciliation of FCF and
Adjusted FCF to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

We derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications
platform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also provide
services, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are generally
considered distinct from the access to our unified communications platform.
                                                                                                                   
  Cost of Revenue                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing
general operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, third-
party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized
software development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost
of revenue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center capacity. We
expect, however, that our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively flat for the rest of
the current fiscal year.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our
research and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated
overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research
and development for the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing research and development headcount, as we focus
on further developing our platform, enhancing its use cases, and strengthening security and privacy. As a result,
we expect our research and development expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue
for the rest of the current fiscal year.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and
marketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote
our brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,
Zoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to
sales and amortization of deferred

contract acquisition costs. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future,
primarily by increasing the headcount of our direct sales force and marketing investments in demand generation. As
a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
revenue for the rest of the current fiscal year.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and
legal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected
credit losses; insurance; indirect taxes; litigation settlements, and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the
size of our general and administrative function to support the growth and complexity of our business. As a result,
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
revenue for the rest of the current fiscal year.

Cost of revenue for the three months ended April 30, 2022 decreased by $3.2 million, or 1%, compared to the three
months ended April 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $44.0 million related to cloud hosting
expenses as we expanded our internal data center capacity to replace third-party hosting services, as well as lower
rates from third-party hosting providers. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $29.9 million in
personnel-related expenses, which includes an increase of $17.1 million in stock-based compensation expense, mainly
driven by additional headcount and expanded equity programs; and an increase of $9.9 million in costs related to
subscription to software-based services.

Gross margin increased to 76% for the three months ended April 30, 2022 from 72% for the three months ended April

center capacity as well as lower rates from third-party cloud hosting providers.

Research and development expense for the three months ended April 30, 2022 increased by $79.1 million, or 121%,
compared to the three months ended April 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related
expenses of $72.1 million, which includes a $34.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, mainly
driven by additional headcount and expanded equity programs .

Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended April 30, 2022 increased by $117.1 million, or 48%, compared
to the three months ended April 30, 2021. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher

global expansion, which includes a $42.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $19.0 million
increase in amortization of deferred

General and administrative expense for the three months ended April 30, 2022 decreased by $36.2 million, or 24%,
compared to the three months ended April 30, 2021. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily
due to a decrease of $71.1 million in prior year litigation settlement expense, net of amounts estimated to be
covered by insurance; partially offset by an increase of $29.8 million in personnel-related expenses, which
includes a $16.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, mainly driven by additional headcount and

As of April 30, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of
$5.7 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our
marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate
and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.

We have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from
operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of
the COVID-19

pandemic, including timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in the section titled
“Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our existing cash,
cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to
meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We believe we
will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from
operating activities and available cash balances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,
including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of
spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses
associated with our international expansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest
in existing and new office spaces as well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into
arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual
property rights. We may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that
additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or
at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and
financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

There have been no material changes to our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations
from those disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 7,

Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscriptions to our platform. Our
primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our
platform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted
for certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as
well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $526.2 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022, compared to
$533.3 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to a decrease
in net income of $113.9 million and the negative impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $84.4
million, offset by an increase in non-cash adjustments of $191.1 million, which is primarily a result of higher
stock-based compensation expense, higher losses on strategic investments, net, and higher deferred contract
acquisition cost amortization due to an increase in capitalized commissions as we continue to grow and expand our
customer base.

Net cash used in investing activities of $42.3 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022 was due to
purchases of property and equipment of $25.0 million, purchases of strategic investments of $11.8 million,
purchases of intangible assets of $3.2 million, and net purchases of marketable securities of $2.3 million.

Net cash used in investing activities of $1,220.0 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021 was primarily
due to net purchases of marketable securities of $1,134.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $79.1

Net cash used in financing activities of $133.2 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022 was due to cash
paid for repurchases of common stock of $132.4 million , proceeds from employee equity transactions remitted to
employees and tax authorities, net, of $4.1 million, offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.3
million.

Net cash used in financing activities of $6.3 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021 was primarily due
to proceeds from employee equity transactions to be remitted to employees and tax authorities, net, of $10.0
million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.4 million.
                                                                                                                   
  Critical Accounting Estimates                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
Critical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the
nature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly
uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial
condition or operating performance is material.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting
estimates described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 7,
2022.

  Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a small amount
denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in
which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, China, Europe, and Australia. Our
results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates
applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has
not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions,
but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.
                                                                                                                   
  Interest Rate Risk                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
We had cash and cash equivalents of $1,407.3 million and marketable securities of $4,319.0 million as of April 30,
2022. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds, and high-grade commercial paper, and
agency bonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate
and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of
interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing
income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes
and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-
term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks
due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented
would not have had a material impact on our historical condensed consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and
15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2022 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is
also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and
uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to
invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of
the risks actually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price
of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
                                                                                                                   
   Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
Our business depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and upsell additional products and new product
categories to existing customers, and upgrade free users to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers,
renewals, or upgrades would harm our business.

Our business depends upon our ability to attract new customers, and maintain and expand our relationships with our
existing customers, including upselling additional products and new product categories to our existing customers
and upgrading hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications platform who
initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe
to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.”

Our business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their
subscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers
will renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,
or purchase additional products, if they renew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or
fluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no
longer having a need for our products, including any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services
during the COVID-19 pandemic that may subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic
has tapered, or the perception that competitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In
addition, some customers downgrade their Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a
result of the increased usage of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted largely
from businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could result
in higher non-renewal rates than we have experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and hosts
to grow our business beyond our current user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to continue to
use our platform. Finally, any decrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand,
word-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.

We encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by
recommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand
within organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of
Zoom into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we encourage hosts that subscribe
to our free Zoom Meeting plan to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including
those that initially subscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and
work-from-home mandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or
upgrade hosts of our free Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within
organizations, our business would be harmed.

In addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase. If we
are not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline. While
we continue to add paid users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or decline
as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to taper, particularly as users return to work or school or are
otherwise no longer subject to limitations on in-person meetings.

Our revenue growth rate has begun to decline and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in future
periods.

We have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any
prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue growth rate has begun to
decline and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute
to declines in our growth rate, including higher market penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our
platform, especially as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic tapers, particularly as users return to work or school
or are otherwise no longer subject to limitations on in-person meetings, a failure by us to continue capitalizing
on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business, among others. Declines in our growth rate could
adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be
adversely affected.

Interruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors,
including increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, would impair the delivery of our services, require
us to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.

We currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize
Amazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as
Microsoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,
we establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers.
Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in
interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, other
interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to,
infrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber
extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage, and denial of service issues. In some
instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these problems within an acceptable period of
time. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that impacted a subset of our users for a
limited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or
consolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or transfer our data and our
users’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite precautions that we take during
this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and
we may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer. Interruptions, delays, or outages in
our services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay penalties; may subject us to claims
and litigation; and may cause customers and hosts to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability
to attract new customers and hosts. Our ability to attract and retain customers and hosts depends on our ability to
provide customers and hosts with a highly reliable platform and even minor interruptions or delays in our services
could harm our business.

Additionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, including increased
usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek
to obtain additional capacity, which could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications
platform because of its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers
to meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner,
including as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term
capacity needs, we may need to rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and
Oracle Cloud, which may result in higher variable costs, harming our business, financial condition, and operating
results.

We do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center
facilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;
earthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;
telecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and similar events, any of which could disrupt
our service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant
period of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for
all eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of
terrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other
unanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.

We operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.

The market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain
features of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products
offered by:

• legacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;

• UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and

• consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and
Facebook.

Other large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we
introduce new products and services, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect
competition to intensify in the future. For example, we recently introduced Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel
contact center solution that is optimized for video, which, as we build out our offering, may result in increased
competition against companies that offer similar services, such as Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact, and new
competitors that may enter that market in the future. Also, in connection with the travel restrictions and stay-in-
place policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from
smaller customers, many of whom are consumers or small and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller
customers, we face competition from more consumer-oriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the
consumer market than we do. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive
advantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and
services; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing relationships; more third-party integration; greater
accessibility across devices or applications; greater access to larger user bases; major distribution agreements
with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical, and other resources. Some of our
competitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and
services than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these
trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.

Demand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and
technology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly
affect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free
products, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and
services than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire
customers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on
open source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform
provides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative
products to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be
forced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to
attract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on
occasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in
deferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts
receivable.

Our quarterly results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the
underlying performance of our business.

Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-
period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter
should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate
as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully
reflect the underlying performance of our business. For example, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30,
2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our unified communications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a
significant portion of which is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet
this increased demand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading
our infrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on
public cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the
value of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include,
without limitation, those listed below:

• our ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;

• our ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our
paid Zoom Meeting plans;

• our ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our
platform;

• our ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity
levels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and
marketing efforts;

• changes in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;

• the timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;

Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to
believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or
to cancel their subscriptions to our platform.

Unlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed
broadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.
Increasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due
to capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users has grown and their
usage of communications capacity has increased, we have been required to make additional investments in network
capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of
which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity does not continue to be available to us as our user
base grows in the future, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission
capacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third parties providing
internet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not have access to our
platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new
technologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased
demand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential
users to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid
our platform, which could permanently harm our business.

In addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a
high-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.
Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband
and internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and
wireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own
offerings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that
degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by
restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by
charging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform
less attractive to users and reduce our revenue.

On January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband
internet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The
order requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management
practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient
to enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and
other small businesses to develop,
                                                        36

market, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11, 2018. Numerous parties filed
judicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to the new rules, but reversed the
FCC’s decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet service, requiring case-
by-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC’s rules. The court also
required the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to remain in effect, while the FCC
conducts that review. On February 6, 2020, the court denied requests for rehearing of the original decision, and
the deadline for petitions requesting the Supreme Court to review the decision has passed without the filing of any
such petitions. On February 19, 2020, the FCC released a public notice asking for comment on the three issues the
court required it to reexamine. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that the three issues
remanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order. Petitions for
reconsideration of this decision are pending. Democratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC
following the 2020 elections increases the likelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or
adopt new network neutrality rules. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering
legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A federal court judge
denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network neutrality law, and as a
result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. On March 10, 2021, trade associations representing
internet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction, and the appeal
was denied on January 28, 2022. The trade associations have sought rehearing with the full court of appeal, and on
April 20, 2022 it declined to rehear the case. The appellants will not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. A number
of other states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate
the conduct of broadband providers. For instance, a temporary injunction preventing implementation of a similar law
in Vermont expired on April 20, 2022, but the challenge to that law remains pending. We cannot predict whether the
FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the
court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s new rules, broadband internet access providers may be able
to charge web-based services such as ours for priority access or favor services offered by our competitors or by
the internet access providers themselves, which could result in increased costs and a loss of existing customers
and hosts, impair our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and harm our business.

If there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in
infrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were
repealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on
our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater
deployment challenges.

We have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a
significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval
requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face unexpected deployment challenges with
large organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large organizations may demand additional
features, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional security management or control features.
We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that
our efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their
organization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large
organizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.

We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for
communications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.

We generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a
result, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform
in particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies
market fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if any new customers or hosts that have
subscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the
impact of the pandemic has tapered, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.

Changes in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater
impact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and
collaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of
which are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:

• general awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;

• availability of products and services that compete with ours;
                                                        37                                                         
Table of Contents
• new modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;

• ease of adoption and use;

• features and platform experience;

• reliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;

• performance;

• brand;

• user support; and

• pricing.

The communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in
preferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve
more widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.

We expect to continue to increase our expenses in the future, which could decrease our profitability or prevent us
from maintaining profitability.

We have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend
significant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing efforts to attract new customers and hosts and to
develop and enhance our products and for general corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional
personnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses, upgrading our infrastructure, and addressing
security and privacy issues, including those stemming from the unprecedented numbers of first-time users during the
COVID-19 pandemic who may not have full IT support or established protocols like our larger customers, and
expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we are successful in increasing our user base, we may also
incur increased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated with acquiring customers and
hosts are generally incurred up front, while the subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the
subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear basis. Our efforts to grow our business may be
costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating
expenses, which may result in decreased profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number
of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties,
complications, delays, and other unknown events. For example, we have faced unprecedented usage during the COVID-19
pandemic and, to meet this increased demand, have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs
associated with upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the
extent we have to rely on public cloud providers rather than our own data centers. While free users continue to be
a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing programs focused on converting free users to paid
subscriptions. Some of these new hosts using our platform on a free Basic account have upgraded to a paid Zoom
Meeting plan but the remainder have not and may never do so. If we are unable to increase or sustain our
profitability, the value of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it is
difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our platform, user adoption and
renewal of our platform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive
products and services. As a result, we may not increase or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to
grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.

The experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,
and third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our
relationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.

One of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,
operating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running
Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,
Salesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We
are dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and
applications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other
productivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors
own, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other
software, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute
operating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform
requires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and
services that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business
partners.
                                                        38

Third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure
its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our
competitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,
or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.
For example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely
on to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products
evolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or
standards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to
competitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the
interoperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.

In addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform
with our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by
companies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and
expand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are
quality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’
solutions, our business will be harmed.

We are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change
their technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners
collect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its
iOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising
identifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains
uncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app
store and users, and our business would be harmed.

We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.

The communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and
frequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from
customers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and
products; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.
Our customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest
significantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality
and ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic user demand for our platform. There is no
assurance that new additions or other future enhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or
capabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If
our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand or if we fail to develop our
platform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may
fail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.

The introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to
replace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of
operations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing
that could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,
or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and
capabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released
according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or
claims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to
our platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.
If customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not
perform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,
license, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such
enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.

The failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to
increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.

Our ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and
services will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan
to continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are
unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and
business could be adversely impacted.

Identifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource
intensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to
dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.
All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to
acquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and
                                                        39

sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in
revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire,
develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity
levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.

Our security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security
measures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,
expose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products
and services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or
ceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.

Our operations involve the storage and transmission of customer and user information. Security incidents have
occurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or unauthorized
disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of, this information, interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations
and services, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, and other
possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales, and harm
our business.

Cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase, and cloud-based platform providers
of products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. In addition to traditional computer
“hackers,” we face security risks from sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced
persistent threat intrusions. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks,
including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military
conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon
which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including cyberattacks, that could
materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to provide our services. We may be subject
to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through
phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced
persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or
error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or
other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other
similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-
states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to
significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds.
Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to
make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.

If our security measures are compromised, our reputation could be damaged; our data, information or intellectual
property, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised; our business may be harmed;
and we could incur significant liability. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future
to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our services or
software or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems, because such threats
and techniques change frequently and are generally not detected until after an incident has occurred. In addition,
security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to actively search for
and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may increase because of
increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications platform, and can lead
to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats, business and operational interruptions,
security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory investigations and actions, and substantial harm to
our business, some of which we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security
researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the Zoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on
features. We were able to release updates to the software addressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of
any customers being affected or meetings compromised by these vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are
responsible for installing this update to the software, and their software is subject to these vulnerabilities
until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security researcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to
our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized person to gain root access to a user’s system.

Given the nature of our business and operations, our products and services will inevitably contain vulnerabilities
or critical security defects that have not been identified or remediated and cannot be disclosed without
compromising security. We have identified vulnerabilities in our products and services in the past, and we expect
that we will continue to identify vulnerabilities in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to
address any vulnerabilities in our software products and services that we may become aware of in the future, or
there may be delays in developing patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. We expect
security issues to arise in the future as our products and services are more widely adopted, and as we continue to
expand the features and functionality of existing products and introduce new products.
                                                        40                                                         
Table of Contents
We will continue to make prioritization decisions to determine which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and
the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security. Further, in many cases,
customers are responsible for installing our software updates, and until they do so, their service remains subject
to the vulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, errors in
remediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remediate vulnerabilities or
security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to install software updates could
result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.

Security incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security
may also cause some of our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their
subscriptions. Further, as we rely on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, we depend in part on third-party
security measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and the mishandling of data and
information. Failures to meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality of
their data and information could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and hosts,
attract new customers and hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or security
vulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including class
action litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs for
remediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in
customer, host, and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to
address cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and
settlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because of any such incident.

Many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving
certain types of personal data. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach
is costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches. Security
compromises experienced by our competitors, our customers, or us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to
widespread negative publicity. In addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States,
like many similarly situated technology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel
in China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and
media scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.

Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence
in the effectiveness of our security measures; negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts;
cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions; or subject us to third-party lawsuits,
regulatory investigations, proceedings, and fines, or other action or liability, which could harm our business and
reputation. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our
brand could lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our information
security and potential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For example, in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading to challenges for users who
did not have full IT support or established protocols for security and privacy like our larger customers. As a
result, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and security and privacy issues,
including on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in material reputational harm, a loss
of customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure, additional expenses, and other harm
to our business.

There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use
or other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or
damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance
coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms
or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny
coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are not
covered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including
premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our business.

Our business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to
expand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers, hosts, and
users and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications
platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users view the Zoom brand primarily as a video
conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform that connects people through video, voice, chat
and content sharing, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market position may be
detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and
enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or perception of our
platform, including any delays or interruptions in service due to
                                                        41

capacity constraints stemming from increased usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or of our privacy or security
features, or of the providers of communication and collaboration technologies generally, could adversely affect our
reputation and our ability to attract and retain hosts. Similarly, any unfavorable perception of our company,
including due to any actual or perceived violation by our employees of our policies, such as our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics, could cause us reputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us
to litigation, and harm our business, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand,
including consumer and public perception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this
effort, our business will be harmed.

We may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.

Since our founding in 2011, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our headcount has grown from 5,059 full-
time employees as of April 30, 2021, to 7,155 full-time employees as of April 30, 2022, with employees located both
in the United States and internationally. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous, significant
strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to support our
user base, our expanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our internal controls
and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to grow, we face
challenges integrating, developing, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various countries around the
world. For example, a significant number of our employees were hired in the last two years and have never been to
one of our office locations. Certain members of our management have not previously worked together for an extended
period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a public company, which may affect how they manage
our growth. Managing our growth will also require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management
resources.

In addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our
future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for
and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties
frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary
level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth,
our business would be harmed.

Our business may be significantly affected by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer
or business spending.

Our business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
any resulting effect on spending by our customers, and inflation. Some customers may view a subscription to our
platform as a discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their discretionary spending on our platform
during an economic downturn. Given current economic conditions, including inflation, we could experience a
reduction in demand and loss of customers, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a
prolonged impact on various industries that our unified communications platform addresses. We would lose customers
as a result of customers ceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer payment
cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. While we have seen
increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the increase in usage of our platform
is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. Moreover, while we continue to add paid
users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or decline as the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to taper, particularly in light of a potential economic downturn.

Our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors
in our platform.

The software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,
particularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from
time to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new
products may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and
new products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our
platform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,
access, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in
correcting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our
reputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.

We also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our
platform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause
interruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:

• cause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;

• require us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;
                                                        42                                                         
Table of Contents
• cause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;

• divert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase
our expenses;

• increase our technical support costs; and

• harm our reputation and brand.

If we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we
may not be able to execute our business strategy.

Our success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In
particular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall
management, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our
strategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,
Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,
and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in
particular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. Such changes may result in
a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to
work together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover
or otherwise, our business could be harmed.

The failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company
culture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.

To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for
executives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In
particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in
designing, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for
skilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,
difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill
positions in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need
to be altered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such
changes in a timely manner. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience employee turnover as a
result of the ongoing “great resignation” occurring throughout the U.S. economy. New hires require training and
take time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we
may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If we fail to attract new personnel or
fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business could be harmed.

Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some
of these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job
candidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with
their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash
compensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly
skilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing
employers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and
resources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to
recruit internationally. Moreover, as we plan to reopen our offices, vaccine mandates and similar government orders
and restrictions could result in employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting. We must also continue to retain
and motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development
opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be
harmed.

We believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we
continue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-
centric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.
As we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need
to address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.

In addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our IPO, employees joining us at different times could have
significant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which could create disparities
in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees and our business. Further,
the volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less attractive to current and potential
employees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in hiring.

We have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,
regulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.

Our platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major
opportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 32% and 34% of our revenue for the three
months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in further select
international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with global users, and we expect
to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions and
providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any new
markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our
platform may not be receptive. For example, if we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-specific
requirements, we may experience service outages or other adverse consequences which would impair our ability to
expand further into certain markets. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations
internationally in the future may require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the
particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,
customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international
expansion will require investment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to
recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex
employment- and compensation-related laws, regulations, and practices in these international jurisdictions, and
maintaining our company culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to
employees in certain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations.
This may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash
compensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees
in these jurisdictions.

Operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks
associated with:

• providing our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among
different cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are
culturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;

• compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to
privacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, and
unsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our
practices are deemed to be out of compliance;

• operating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our
services;

• management of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention
flexibility as does the United States;

• operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as does the United
States and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;

• foreign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United
States, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual
property outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;

• integration with partners outside of the United States;

• compliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,
trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in
certain international markets;

• foreign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic
territories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;

• political and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”) withdrawal from the
European Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade
protection measures, import or export requirements, trade embargoes, and other trade barriers;

• generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may
increase as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a
timely basis;
                                                        44

• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the
income and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including
the imposition of digital services taxes; and

• higher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal
compliance costs.

In addition, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, European Union,
and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and Belarus.
Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian financial
institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or the SWIFT,
payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be taken in
future, by the U.S., NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could result in a
regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could
adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new business
opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.

Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing
business in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as
they occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and
regulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,
contractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and
criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and
regulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease
operations in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, while our engineering team is headquartered in the
United States, we employ a product development team that has a relatively significant footprint in China today,
where personnel costs are less expensive than in many other geographies. This product development team carries out
the design and architecture decisions made by our U.S. engineering team. We also intend to expand our research and
development presence in Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as in Singapore and India. As a
result of this expansion, we could experience, among other things, difficulty in attracting and retaining talent in
these locations and higher operating expenses, which would adversely impact our operating margins and harm our
business.

At the same time, our operations in China have caused and may in the future cause us to be subject to regulatory
scrutiny both in China and in the United States. For example, in September 2019, the Chinese government turned off
our service in China without warning and requested that we take certain steps prior to restoring our service,
including designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests and transferring China-based user data
housed in the United States to a data center in China. Also, in June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the
Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of
Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas
requested information about (among other things) our interactions with foreign governments and/or foreign political
parties, including the Chinese government, as well as about storage of and access to user data, including the use
of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY subpoena requested information about the actions we took relating
to the Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. The NDCA subpoena also requested documents and information about (among
other things) contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or
successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate
to users in the United States. We are fully cooperating with these investigations and have been conducting our own
thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed,
which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or
may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these
matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material
reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our
business.

We recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,
increases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be
difficult to discern.

We recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a
portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to
subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any
single quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a
decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in
sales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully
reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is
expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the
number of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower
                                                        45

revenue in the earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it
difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new
customers or from existing customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of
Zoom Meeting plan must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.

Any failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers
and hosts and, consequently, our business.

Increased user demand for support may result in increased costs that may harm our results of operations. Surging
demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to allocate additional resources to support our expanded user
base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time. In addition, as we continue
to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide efficient
support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. As the number of our hosts has grown
significantly, it has put additional pressure on our support organization. If we are unable to provide efficient
user support globally at scale or if we need to hire additional support personnel, including as a result of
increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, our business may be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are
highly dependent on our business reputation and on recommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any
failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for
our customers and hosts, would harm our business.

We utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,
manage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.

Our future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,
and we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small
portion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as
resellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from
other communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce
our revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor
their products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining
qualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant
time and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to
scale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and
training. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to
effectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop
relationships with new resellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to
manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of
new customers and hosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our
business.

Our results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange
rates fluctuate substantially in the future.

We sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we
continue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a
small amount is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of
the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, 21.2% and
23.0% of our revenue, respectively, and 10.9% and 12.2% of our expenses, respectively, were denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report
our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could materially impact our
results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.

Our sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges
and risks.

We expect to continue selling our products and services to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency
customers, which may occur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers
and/or through direct sales to government entities. While we are a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management
Program (“FedRAMP”) authorized SaaS service, selling to government entities and other government contractors
presents a number of unique challenges and risks including the following:
                                                        46                                                         
Table of Contents
• selling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private
entities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance
that these efforts will generate a sale;

• government certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more
government certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector
until we have attained such certificates;

• contracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government
market, contain terms that differ less favorably from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,
including, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;

• non-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made
in connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically
would expect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability
under the civil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;

• government demand and payment for our products may be influenced, among other things, by public sector budgetary
cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector
demand for our products; and

• government-imposed vaccine mandates could result in increased attrition and difficulties in recruiting, and non-
compliance with any such mandates could restrict our ability to do business with governmental entities.

To the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors
in the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our
business.

In May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional
information technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor
authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records
laws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development
practices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure
practices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be
required to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive
Order, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our
compliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the
U.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.

Our current products, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not
be widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or
reimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.

Our ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend
on our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together
with third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and
unproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating
experience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase
our base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially
suffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products
to new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our products, or
the introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,
retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate
sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may
harm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current products, as well as products,
features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third
parties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate
carriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that
will use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our
margins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the future
may similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third parties, all of which would lower our profit margins for
any such new products. If this trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could
harm our business.

If we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,
we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our
customer and paid host base to decline significantly.
                                                        47

A large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If
customers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs
for which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online
or over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our
risk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit
card companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,
something that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions
becomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to
accept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data
protection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to
maintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations
could fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for
our products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing
customer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can
result in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and
expenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no
reimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.
Although we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls
will be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card
payments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our
effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with
differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses;
changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to
use, deferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions.

The provision for taxes on our condensed consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in
accounting principles; changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals,
other fundamental changes in tax law currently being considered by many countries; and changes in taxing
jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to
review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with
tax positions we take, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business
could be adversely impacted.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses
effective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. Absent a change in legislation, we expect it will have a
material impact on our cash flows beginning in this current fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. Although Congress
is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, we have no assurance that
the provision will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified.

We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from
changes in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative
interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial
decisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as
the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other
countries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have
proposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue derived from digital
services. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of the OECD's
Inclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing
our future tax obligations.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require
significant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.

We have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We
have limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not
be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not
ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be
viewed negatively by users, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired
businesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to
successfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our
company, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any
                                                        48

integration process will require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management and
disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which
could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and
accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.

We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which
could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such
acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased
fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to
flexibly operate our business.

We have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our
prospects and future results of operations.

Beginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our unified communications
platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we
have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our
future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for
and model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our
future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could continue to slow or our revenue could
decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;
contraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for
capacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic
has also made it difficult to forecast revenue, costs, and expenses, as our platform has recently faced
unprecedented usage from free users and new and existing customers, requiring us to devote significant resources to
bolster our capacity and infrastructure. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently
experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described
herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are
incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be harmed.

We rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such
metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.

We track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have
limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in
unexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track
these metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our
understanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.

We are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our
processes to assess potential improvements.
                                                                                                                   
  Risks Related to Laws and Regulations                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving
privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual
obligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.

We receive, store, process, generate, use, and share personal information and other customer and user content
necessary to provide our service and ensure it is delivered effectively, to operate our business, for legal and
marketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. There are numerous federal, state, local, and
international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the collection,
storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content,
the scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among
countries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual
obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. Although we endeavor to
comply with applicable laws and our policies, publications, certifications, and documentation, and other
obligations, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, we may not be
successful in achieving compliance if our employees, vendors or business partners do not comply with our policies,
certifications, and documentation. Any actual or perceived compliance failure, as well as greater public scrutiny
of our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, could result in increased governmental and
regulatory scrutiny and litigation exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user
confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.
                                                        49

For example, in June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign
political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user
data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the
Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various
security, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as
well as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks
information relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any
attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as
they relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking
related information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own
thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed,
which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or
may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these
matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material
reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our
business.

We also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, industry standards, guidance and
contractual obligations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in
various jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect
in the EU, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) implemented the U.K. GDPR. The GDPR and the U.K. GDPR impose more
stringent data protection requirements and provide greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data
protection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions on data processing, and
fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers’,
partners’, or vendors’ failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or
restrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our product and services. We may
also be obligated to assist our customers, partners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the
GDPR, which could require expenditure of significant resources. Additionally, Brazil recently enacted the General
Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), which broadly
regulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance obligations and penalties comparable to
those of the GDPR. Additionally, in August 2021, China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”),
which took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL introduces a legal framework similar to the GDPR and is viewed as
the beginning of a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China, although numerous
aspects of the law remain uncertain and developing and the impact that PIPL will have on businesses remains
uncertain. We also target customers in Asia and have operations in Japan and Singapore, and may be subject to new
and emerging privacy, data protection, and information security regimes in Asia, including Japan’s Act on the
Protection of Personal Information and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act.

Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border data transfer laws. For example, absent
appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal information to
countries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, which the European Commission does not consider to provide
an adequate level of data privacy and security. The European Commission released a set of Standard Contractual
Clauses that are designed to be a lawful mechanism by which entities can transfer personal information out of the
EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. The
Standard Contractual Clauses require parties that rely upon them to comply with additional obligations, such as
conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect
the at-issue personal information. Moreover, due to potential legal challenges, there exists some uncertainty
regarding whether the Standard Contractual Clauses will remain a valid mechanism for transfers of personal
information out of the EEA. In addition, laws in Switzerland and the U.K. similarly restrict transfers of personal
information outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the United States that do not provide an adequate
level of personal information protection.

In addition to European restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information, other jurisdictions (e.g.,
Russia, China, and Brazil) have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal information transfer laws
and local personal information residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing
business. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border transfers, we may face increased
exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal
information from Europe or elsewhere. The inability to import personal information to the United States could
significantly and negatively impact our business operations; limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that
are subject to European and other privacy, data protection, and information security laws; or requiring us to
increase our personal information processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.

We are also subject to evolving EU and U.K. privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. European regulators are
increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current
national
                                                        50                                                         
Table of Contents
laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are likely to be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation, which could lead
to substantial costs, limit the effectiveness of our marketing and personalization activities, and subject us to
additional liabilities.

States have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. For example, the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy
protections. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). The CCPA will be
expanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), which was
approved by California voters in November 2020, becomes fully operative. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA, and their
interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are far-reaching and
may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in
an effort to comply.

The CCPA appears to mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States,
as other states have followed California’s lead and increase protections for their residents. The CCPA has already
prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our
potential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective
October 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among
other things, that businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from
consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal information. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have
similarly enacted comprehensive privacy, data protection and information security laws, that emulate the CCPA and
CPRA in many respects and take effect in 2023.

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a U.S. Federal law that applies to operators of
commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal
information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are
collecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications services to
schools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid classrooms, distance
learning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these services, Zoom may be used
by students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information from such students on
behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s information practices on
behalf of students, prior to students using the services. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain processing of the
personal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on the country) without parental consent. If we
fail to accurately anticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and
CCPA, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions, litigation, fines and
penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such failures, we could be in
breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us, which could harm our
reputation and business.

With laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and UK GDPR in the EU as well as the CCPA, SPI Law, HIPAA, and COPPA in
the United States imposing relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the
interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we have faced and may face additional
challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices. Additional
uses of our services arising out of increased demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require us to
address additional privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and
contractual obligations.

We have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and
international government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information
security practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary
remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of
management from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face
litigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in
various jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.

We were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and
practices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,
2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other
orders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and
security practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the
possibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,
or monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the
diversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens
imposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our
users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could
have an adverse impact on our business.

Additionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain
the necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured
correctly for their
                                                        51                                                         
Table of Contents
compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third parties we work with, such
as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and regulations, or our policies, such
misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect
on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding the
collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or regarding the manner in which the
express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or disclosure of such content is obtained,
could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, which
we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and process user data or provide or develop new
services and features.

Increased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic
has led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,
disclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and
customers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their
own IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with
control over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by
malicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory
scrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user
confidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.

Changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our
ability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of
operations.

The U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially
interfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our
products directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened
tougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future
imposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In
response, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The direct and indirect effects of
tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China
economic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of
governmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions
and further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China,
could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade
restrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken
by the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or
other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries
in retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between the United States and China could exacerbate
these actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law
in Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with
the business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy
or operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and
certain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or react to these changes.

Further, in recent years, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and
communications technology and services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions.
In May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to
implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national
security risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to
contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce
issued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS transactions that pose a national
security risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as China. Several aspects of this rule
remain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule will be implemented and enforced in
practice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement
further restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty
regarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will
successfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the
executive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business,
including in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced
sales.

We may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.

We currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a
presence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform
are classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations which are
subject to varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as
ours, uncertain and complex. We believe that we
                                                        52                                                         
Table of Contents
are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional taxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and
local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical presence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing
jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales of our platform in the relevant taxing
jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus for sales made over the Internet and,
after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may require an e-commerce business with no
in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it is possible that we could face future
audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our
estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in the U.S. or internationally, could harm our
business.

We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international
markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.

Our platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions
laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and
various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions
or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned
countries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption
items. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through
import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to
distribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.

Although we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in
violation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used
by some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently
made our software products available to some customers in potential violation of the EAR. As a result, we have
submitted and from time to time will continue to submit as warranted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures
regarding compliance with U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of
Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”). For instance, in March 2022, we submitted a voluntary self-
disclosure to BIS regarding compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and regulations.

If we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result
in fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,
reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional
controls designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully
effective.

Changes in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of
subscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from
using our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,
governments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic
sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,
governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or
in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international
operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would
likely harm our business.

We may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that
could result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,
changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with
the laws.

We may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering
copyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and
similar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,
subpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy
or comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or
illegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of
policy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,
violent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such
activity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the
host or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful
behavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety
team may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or
referral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as
a result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area
                                                        53

are currently in a state of flux and vary widely between jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the
future we and our competitors may be subject to legal actions along with the users who shared such content. In
addition, regardless of any legal liability we may face, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident
generating extensive negative publicity about the content shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our
business.

We are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws
related to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could
adversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract
new customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future
become the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,
including our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or
applied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur
fines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.

Our platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has
been blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,
or fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we
could be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.

We are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-
bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their
employees and intermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or
benefits to government officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public
companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation
and to device and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to
prevent violations of anti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to
expand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Zoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the
future may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to
comply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.

Federal Regulation

Zoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by
the FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is
subject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,
disability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory
assessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law
enforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In
addition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in
additional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state
regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to
restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could
ultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public
process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers
and harm our business.

Changes in FCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations
on our other services. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that three issues remanded by the
U.S. Court of Appeals following the appeal of its 2018 decision to eliminate its network neutrality rules did not
provide a basis to alter its conclusions in that order. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending.
Democratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the
likelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. Such
action could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the
ones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to
modify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation
could result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.

There have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the
Communications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many
Members of Congress from both parties support the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of
Congressional action remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to
adopt rules interpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that
is transmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of
                                                        54                                                         
Table of Contents
offensive content. No date has been set for a vote on that proposal and the FCC has not released any document
describing the rules that would be proposed. The Democratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed
to the petition and now control the agenda of the FCC. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition.
If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or the FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of
protection offered by Section 230. In addition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in
changes to the protections afforded to internet platforms, including a lawsuit by former President Trump that, if
successful, would greatly limit the scope of Section 230. These various efforts to limit the protections provided
by Section 230 would increase the risks faced by internet-based businesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party
content. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in
investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for our customers’ or other users’ activities, we
could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any
damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.

State Regulation

State telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to
assess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to
state USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their
programs to include the products we offer and the California Public Utilities Commission is now taking the position
that it can require VoIP providers like Zoom Phone to obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass
USF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in
our products becoming more expensive. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts
to apply state telecommunications regulations to services like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or
future state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may
have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which
could harm our business.

A federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network
neutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. Trade associations
representing internet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction,
and the appeal was denied on January 28, 2022. On April 20, 2022 the Ninth Circuit declined to rehear the case and
the appellants have since announced that they will not file for an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot
predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.

Legislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas that is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses
operating on the Internet to moderate user-generated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections
granted under Section 230. Similar legislation has been introduced in other states in 2022, including a bill that
has passed the Georgia State Senate and is pending before the Georgia House. In response to challenges from
industry groups, a federal court enjoined enforcement of the Florida law, and on May 23, 2022, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the lower court ruling preventing enforcement of restrictions on
moderation. Florida recently amended its legislation in an effort to address the issues that led to the injunction
barring enforcement of its statute. The Texas law initially was enjoined by a federal district court in response to
a challenge from industry groups, but on May 11, 2022, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
stayed the district court decision pending full review of the district court decision. As a result, the Texas law
is now in effect. On May 13, 2022, the industry groups asked the Supreme Court of the United to temporarily vacate
the Fifth Circuit’s stay while it considers the request in full and for an order permanently vacating the Fifth
Circuit’s stay, which would reinstate the district court’s decision. It is likely that any other such state
legislation also would be challenged under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it
is preempted by Section 230. We cannot predict whether any such state legislation will be adopted, enforced,
modified, overturned, or vacated.

International Regulation

As we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data
protection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not
comply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to
substantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise
the price of our products, any of which could harm our business.
                                                                                                                   
  Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
We are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation
matters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.

We protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,
from time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other
violations of intellectual
                                                        55                                                         
Table of Contents
property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,
copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face increasing competition and
gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims, commercial claims, and
other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may from time to time in the future
become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property, our business practices, and our
platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we have valid defenses to these
claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from
our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our services, which would harm our
business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be
obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be subject
to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The terms of any settlement or judgment may
require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, our
agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying them against liabilities if
our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, which could require us to make payments to our
customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may make announcements regarding the results of
hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these
announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. With respect to any
intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of
third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating
expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at all, and we may be required to develop
alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative,
non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense. Our business could be harmed
as a result.

Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and
other intangible assets.

We primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and
domain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our
employees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make
business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright
or trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where
we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every
significant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an
important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately
protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in
those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may
knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third parties may challenge our proprietary right;
pending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to
prevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the
development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies
and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants,
and third parties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not
provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others
may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or
develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same
level of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks,
trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain
countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other
intellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending
our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of
theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including
technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our
intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial
advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary
to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is
inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible
assets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features.
Any of these events would harm our business.

Our use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to
our platform and subject us to possible litigation.

We have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open
source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time
to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open
source software and
                                                        56                                                         
Table of Contents
requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be subject to suits by
parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with the
applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users who use, distribute or
make available across a network software and services that include open source software to offer aspects of the
technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to make publicly
available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for modifications or
derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to license such
modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally, if a third-
party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we
could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our licensed
software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open source
software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source
software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims
of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an
increasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law
to provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the
terms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our
proprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of
our software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.

In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of
third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on
the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks
because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to
determine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our
competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject
to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in the usage of our unified communications platform,
and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly increased, while at the same time,
the broader market has experienced significant declines and volatility. There are no assurances that the trading
price of our Class A common stock will continue at this level for any period of time. Moreover, the trading price
of our Class A common stock could experience a significant decrease once the scope and impact of the COVID-19
pandemic is better understood. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our
Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock
include the following:

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;

• volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;

• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in
our industry in particular;

• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;

• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts
who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet
those projections;

• announcements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;

• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;

• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;

• actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;

• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape
generally;
                                                        57                                                         
Table of Contents
• litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of
our competitors;

• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;

• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;

• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;

• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;

• any significant change in our management; and

• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.

In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a
particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these
companies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020 and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and
directors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging
violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our
data privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert
our management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the
target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.

The dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,
including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence
corporate matters.

Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of April
30, 2022, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 64.9% of the voting power of our outstanding
capital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding
57.5% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of April 30, 2022, our founder, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.5% of our outstanding capital stock but
controlled approximately 31.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have
significant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or
our assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one
share of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or
incapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing
services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of
the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary
of the closing of our IPO.

In addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters
submitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the
outstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate
matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be
adversely affected.

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A
common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of
Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant
portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a
majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a
fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best
interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his
shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.

In addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly
public companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected
indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the
S&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for
inclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment
vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies may
depress the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, or depress our trading volume
compared to those of other similar companies that are included.

Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional
dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.
                                                        58

Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial
dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity
securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell
any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such
subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A
common stock.

Substantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market
price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically
converting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could
depress the market price of our Class A common stock.

In addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by
them for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved
for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable
exercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise
of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available
for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.

Sales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities
in the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A
common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.

Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our
stockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market
price of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.

There are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to
acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our
stockholders.

Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:

• establishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one
time;

• permitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created
directorships;

• providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

• prohibiting cumulative voting for directors;

• requiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;

• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a
stockholder rights plan;

• eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a
meeting of our stockholders; and

• our dual-class common stock structure as described above.

Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging
or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in
excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
Any provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or
deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their
shares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our
Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us
and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us
or our directors, officers, or employees.
                                                        59

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection
of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under
Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or
our stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or
the certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim
that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all
cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would
not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of
the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act
actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having
to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different
courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal
district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a
cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of
forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than
those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the
validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other
jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other
jurisdictions.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s
ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or
other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a
court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be
inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with
resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.

We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future
earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any
dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock
after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.
                                                                                                                   
  General Risk Factors                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Estimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the
market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at
all.

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have
generated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not
prove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video
communications platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using legacy communication
methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product feature that every
customer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform does not provide. The
variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no
guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates
will purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the markets in which
we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons
outside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm
our business and prospects.
                                                                                                                   
   Our business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
Occurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power
loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,
or health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and
some of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,
and our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other
significant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy
as a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our
                                                        60

service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a
natural disaster or other event, our ability to deliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose
critical data. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate
during and after a disaster and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our
business would be harmed.

We also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted virtually every
country in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an
adverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service
disruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to
support our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. While we have seen increased usage
of our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do
not generate any revenue. For example, we have removed the 40-minute time limit from our free Basic accounts for
customers in K-12 schools in certain countries. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase
in paid hosts or that new or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels after the
COVID-19 pandemic has tapered. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has
required and will continue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.

We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested
capital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial
results.

We have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our
investments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,
acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In
addition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market
data. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an
exit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public
offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have
invested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex
due to the lack of readily available market data.

We record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through
the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our
statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the
valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities.
Our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold
securities for a set period of time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of
investment capital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual
companies could be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.

Our reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,
and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even
affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also
difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which
could harm our business.

We may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable
terms, or at all.

Historically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash
generated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and
cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require
additional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing
will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition
of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be
available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of
equity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to
the rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
                                                        61

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,
our ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations
could be impaired.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-
Oxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect
that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial
compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on
our personnel, systems, and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal
control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to
expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in
our business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal
controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.
We have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public
company, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant
regulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do
not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial
reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with
any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-
implementation issues that may arise.

Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in
the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may
result in a restatement of our condensed consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to
implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results
of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports
regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to
include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.
In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The
Nasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting.

Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report
that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial
reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal
control over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our
Class A common stock.

Our Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not
publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.

The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or
industry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and
are often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our
Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities
would likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us
regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A
common stock to decline.

We incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public
companies in the United States, which may harm our business.
                                                        62                                                         
Table of Contents
As a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other
expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and
financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are
subject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new
guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving
laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses
and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,
notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities
may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.

Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,
including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and
coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events
would also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of
directors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.

(1) In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our
Class A common stock, which expires in February 2024. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected from
time to time, either on the open market (including preset trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and
other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program does not obligate the Company to
repurchase any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. See Note 8 "Stockholders’ Equity and
Equity Incentive Plans" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to share
repurchases.
