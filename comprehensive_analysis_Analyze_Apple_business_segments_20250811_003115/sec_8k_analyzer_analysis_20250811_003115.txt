Based on a meticulous analysis of the provided SEC Form 8-K data for Apple Inc., the following is a summary of events related to financial results.

### **Executive Summary**

The provided 8-K filings for the years 2020 through 2025 consistently announce the issuance of press releases for quarterly financial results under Item 2.02. However, the filings themselves do not contain the specific quantitative data from these releases, such as revenue, net income, growth metrics, or performance breakdowns by business segment. The detailed financial information is consistently referenced as being contained within an "Exhibit 99.1" (Press Release), the contents of which were not provided in the source documents for this analysis.

Therefore, a detailed summary of reported performance, growth metrics, and management commentary for each business segment cannot be constructed.

The filings do indicate the dates of these announcements and the corresponding fiscal periods. A notable financial disclosure appears in a 2024 filing under Item 7.01, related to a one-time tax charge.
