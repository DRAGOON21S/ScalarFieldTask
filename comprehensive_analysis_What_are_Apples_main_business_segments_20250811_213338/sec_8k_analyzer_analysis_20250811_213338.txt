Based on a meticulous analysis of the provided SEC Form 8-K filings for Apple Inc., the following is a summary of the quarterly performance updates.

### **Executive Summary**

The provided Form 8-K filings for the years 2020 through 2025 consistently announce the issuance of press releases concerning quarterly and annual financial results under Item 2.02. However, the filings themselves do not contain the detailed financial data, such as revenue growth or decline for specific business segments. This information is referenced as being contained within the press releases, which are attached as Exhibit 99.1 to each respective filing. **The content of these Exhibit 99.1 press releases was not provided in the analysis data.**

Therefore, a quantitative analysis of revenue by business segment cannot be conducted. The analysis is limited to identifying the dates of these announcements and the fiscal periods they cover.

**Timeline of Earnings Announcements (as per Item 2.02 filings):**
*   **October 29, 2020:** Press release issued for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 26, 2020.
*   **October 28, 2021:** Press release issued for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 25, 2021.
*   **October 27, 2022:** Press release issued for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 24, 2022.

*   **July 31, 2025:** Press release issued for the third fiscal quarter ended June 28, 2025.

The only specific financial impact figure noted in the provided documents is a prospective tax charge disclosed in a 2024 filing under Item 7.01, unrelated to segment operating performance.

This disclosure, dated September 10, 2024, notes that due to a European Court of Justice ruling, "the Company expects to record a one-time income tax charge in its fourth fiscal quarter ending September 28, 2024, of up to approximately $10 billion."
