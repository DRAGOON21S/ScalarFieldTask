============================================================

Based on the provided SEC Form 8-K filing data for Johnson & Johnson, here is a comprehensive analysis focused on legal matters, regulatory inquiries, and other events impacting the company's risk profile.

### **Executive Summary**

The provided 8-K filings from 2021 through 2025 disclose a significant and evolving legal strategy to address extensive cosmetic talc litigation. Johnson & Johnson has utilized a series of subsidiary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings as its primary tool. This strategy involved the creation of new, separate subsidiaries—first LTL Management LLC and later Red River Talc LLC—to hold and manage the talc-related claims.

These bankruptcy proceedings have been accompanied by substantial financial commitments and charges. Key events include an initial $2 billion trust and a $1.4 billion litigation charge in 2021, a subsequent agreement to contribute up to $8.9 billion (present value) leading to a $6.9 billion charge in 2023, and a revised settlement contribution of approximately $8 billion (present value) in 2024. A major development occurred in 2025 when a U.S. Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the proposed prepackaged plan by the Red River Talc subsidiary, leading the company to announce a reversal of an approximately $7 billion reserve.

**Timeline of Key Legal Events (Based on Filing Disclosures):**
*   **Post-Q3 2021:** LTL Management LLC, a newly created subsidiary, files for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy to resolve cosmetic talc claims. Johnson & Johnson establishes a $2 billion trust and records an incremental $1.4 billion litigation charge.
