PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Dimon’s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics, amounting to 85% of his total variable incentive compensation. The amounts of base salary, cash incentive and PSUs remain unchanged from last year.

In 2022 the Firm reported record revenue for the 5th consecutive year of $132.3 billion and net income of $37.7 billion, or $12.09 per share, with ROTCE of 18%.

During 2022 the Firm raised over $2.4 trillion of credit and capital for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which includes individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. The Firm continued its investments in technology, people, systems and products, as well as its inclusive efforts to help grow economies and advance cities and neighborhoods around the world, positioning the Firm for future success.",
                "Board_Considerations": "As part of determining Mr. Dimon’s compensation, the Board considered his holistic performance across financial and non-financial performance dimensions, as well as feedback from investors at the 2022 Annual Meeting and the Firm’s ongoing shareholder engagement. In addition to the Firm’s strong financial performance in 2022 and its continued momentum over the long-term, the Board considered the stability and strength of the Firm’s operating performance during the three years marked by the pandemic and subsequent reopening of the global economy, which introduced volatility to the Firm’s reported financial performance primarily as a function of large reserve builds in 2020, followed by subsequent releases in 2021.",
                "Leadership_Acknowledgement": "The Board also took into account Mr. Dimon’s continued exemplary leadership of the Firm, which continues to be one of the largest financial services firms in the world and is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Company serves millions of customers, predominantly in the United States, and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients globally. The Board continues to recognize that the Firm is in a uniquely fortunate position to be led by such a highly talented and experienced executive who continues to grow the company, maintain market leadership positions, strengthen the Firm’s reputation, invest at the cutting edge in opportunities for the future, promote diversity and best practices, manage risk and develop great leaders, while also maintaining his focus on the Firm’s clients.",

Equity incentives are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy which applies in the event of a material restatement of the Firm's financial results. In addition, all equity awards granted in 2023 contain recapture provisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the value of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In addition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards awarded to the CEO are also subject to additional Protection-based Vesting provisions under which awards may be cancelled as determined by the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by the Board of Directors.\n3.
