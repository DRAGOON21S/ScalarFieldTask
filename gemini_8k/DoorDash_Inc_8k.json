Adjusted EBITDA is a measure that DoorDash uses to assess its operating performance and the operating leverage in its business. DoorDash defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs, (iv) impairment expenses, (v) provision for income taxes, (vi) interest income and expense, (vii) other income (expense), net, (viii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (ix) depreciation and amortization expense. DoorDash’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in DoorDash’s consolidated statements of operations. Thus, DoorDash’s Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP."

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance.

These risks and uncertainties include the possibility that: there are impediments to our ability to execute the Plan or related initiatives as currently contemplated; the actual charges in implementing the Plan or related initiatives are higher than anticipated; there are changes to the assumptions on which the estimated charges associated with the Plan or related initiatives are based; we are unable to achieve projected cost savings in connection with the Plan or related initiatives; there are unintended consequences from the Plan or related initiatives that impact our business; there are changes in the macroeconomic environment that impact our business; or we are unable to make accurate predictions about our future performance due to our limited operating history. The forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted, including those more fully described in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

The Company used approximately $338.5 million of the net proceeds to fund convertible note hedge transactions and intends to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and share repurchases.

Before November 15, 2029, conversion is limited to certain events; thereafter, noteholders may convert at any time.
