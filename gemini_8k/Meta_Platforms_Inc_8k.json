As of today, we expect our full-year 2023 total expenses to be in the range of $86-92 billion, lowered from $89-95 billion previously. This includes the anticipated impact of these layoffs and other cost reduction measures, and is inclusive of restructuring costs of approximately $3-5 billion related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. The information furnished with this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors, including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; potential adverse outcomes in litigation and government inquiries, including settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and the impact of our cost-reduction initiatives, including the planned layoff. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond Meta's control, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
