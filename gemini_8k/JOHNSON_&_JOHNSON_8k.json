This filing is intended to resolve all claims related to cosmetic talc in a manner that is equitable to all parties, including any current and future claimants. Johnson & Johnson and its other affiliates did not file for bankruptcy protection and will continue to operate their businesses as usual. To demonstrate its commitment to resolving the cosmetic talc cases and remove any financial objections to the process, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and will also establish a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The $2 billion trust resulted in an incremental $1.4 billion litigation charge (recorded in Other income & expense) in the third fiscal quarter. While LTL pursues this equitable resolution, all pending cosmetic talc cases will be stayed. The press release further discussing this announcement is attached below as Exhibit 99.3.",

All conditions to the Offer having been satisfied, Purchaser subsequently irrevocably accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time, and will promptly pay for such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Following the completion of the Offer, on December 22, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, Purchaser merged with and into ABIOMED (the “ Merger”), with ABIOMED continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and thereby becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.",
