                "content": "BUSINESS\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and\nMedical Devices.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other\ncompanies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedical Devices\nThe Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics,\nSurgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products\n(Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and\nischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees,\nTrauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios (Ethicon) include advanced and general surgery offerings,\nsolutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson &\nJohnson Vision products such as ACUVUE ® Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to\ncataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and\nused predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products\nand methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold\nin international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other\nintellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n2\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.3% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA ®. The latest expiring United States patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European patent expires\nin 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and\nhyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 5.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns\npatents related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The latest\nexpiring licensed United States patent expires in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in\n2031. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO™.\nSales of the Company’s third largest product, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), accounted for approximately 5.0% of the\nCompany's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, patents related to this product are believed to be material\nto the Company. Pharmacyclics LLC (an AbbVie company) owns the patents related to IMBRUVICA ® , and Janssen\nBiotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The Pharmacyclics patents and their expiration dates are\nlisted in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). Pharmacyclics LLC and\nJanssen Biotech, Inc. have entered into confidential settlement agreements with certain generic companies granting\nlicenses to market their generic ibrutinib products in the United States before the expiration of certain patents.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the\nfourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for\nadvertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\nCompany’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a\nmaterial effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a\ncorresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets\noutside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in\nother countries are examples of such increased regulation.\n3\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\nmedical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain\nor seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products,\nrefuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for\nexports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks\nof substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our\nofficers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain\nconduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department\nof Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing\nand selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a\nsubstantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in\ndifferent countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write\nprescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and\nregulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in\nthe healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare\ncompanies and health care providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and\nother transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to\ncertain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require\nstrict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign\ngovernment official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being\npaid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs\nof health care generally.\nU.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual\nmandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid\nexpansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not\noffering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being\nchallenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to\njudicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which challenges the\nconstitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to\nbuy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the\nMedicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of\nthe benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the\nstate level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape\nhas both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how\nvarious provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry.\nIn addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the\nCompany's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nThe global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and\nglobal economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many\nchallenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of\nregulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and\ndevices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\n4\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the number of employees were approximately:\n2020       2019\nEmployees1                               136,400    133,200\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    134,500    132,200\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\nworldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business\nconduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide\nadditional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global\nsurveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential\nhuman resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2020, 93% of global employees across 78 countries\nparticipated in Our Credo Survey which is offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and\nretain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and\nbe provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs\nand educational resources\n5\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2020, 44.6% of employees in Manager and above\njob categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines\n(including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development\norganizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 5.2%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's\ncontinued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses\non three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges\nand opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:\nAccelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation\nBuild a diverse workforce for the future\nEnhance business results and reputation\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\neverywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial,\nphysical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement\nsavings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee\nassistance programs.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals. The programs and practices\nthe Company advances covers three core dimensions: Healthy Eating, Healthy Movement and Healthy Mind.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

                "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company's control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and\ntechnologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\nretailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name\nconsumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nhundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather\nevents, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and\ndifficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as\nsignificant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party\nmanufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties, including the Company’s strategic partnership with Jabil\nin the Medical Devices segment, to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory\ncompliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to\nmanage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible\ntermination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or\ninconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose\nbenefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to\nsecure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may\n7\nexperience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and\nsource other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which\ncould affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions\nor future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics, including the global outbreak of the\nnovel coronavirus and its mutations (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to\ncontinue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of\nCOVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the\nCompany's employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as\nthe Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The\nCompany continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our\nglobal supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our\nbusiness from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19\nwill impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence,\nincluding the duration of the outbreak . Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of\nnew mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The\ncontinued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things,\nour manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial\noperations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global\neconomic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including uncertainties\nrelated to the risk that our development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval or\nEmergency Use Authorization from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial data, including\nfurther analyses of existing preclinical or clinical trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for\nselection of the JNJ-78436735 vaccine candidate and dose level for the Phase 3 (ENSEMBLE) trial; the risk that\nclinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer\nreview/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; disruptions in\nthe relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies\nmay produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer\nexist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may\nnot be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes\nin the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19;\nthe risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may\nexperience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply\nchannels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would\nnegatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine candidate within the\nprojected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine\ndevelopment program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and those\nincorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of\nchanges in consumption as well as changes in\n8\nlaws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have\nbeen constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently\nknown to the Company.\nRisk Related to the Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in\nadditional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom and Japan,\nhave pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose\nprice controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its\nintellectual property protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company's more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSONS ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however the Company utilizes a\nwholly-owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\nsignificant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\nlegal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they\noperate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable\nquality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to\nfines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product\napprovals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to\nregulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid\nRebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection\nlaws. Scrutiny of health care industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the\nU.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties\nincluding, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant\ncurrent investigations and\n9\nlitigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings”\nunder Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and\nresults of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the\nCompany’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the\nnew tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it\noperates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may\nbe material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8 on income taxes for additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with the 2015 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities\non operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The\nCompany regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of\nits tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the\nCompany’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the\ncompetitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the\nCompany can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current\nlegal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19,\n“Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\nof this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and\nindications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\n10\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. The Company cannot be certain\nwhen or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies,\nwhether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products\nwill be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nRisk Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally .\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2020, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 23% in Europe, 7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in\nthe fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative\ninflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost\nreduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as\na result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high\ninflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;\n11\ntherefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the\nFCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company\noperates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt\nand anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal\nsanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs.\nOther Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:\nprotective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\nrequirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing\ncosts and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of\nthird parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business\nplans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and\nensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats,\nwhich affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses\nthese threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well\nas ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To\ndate, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information\nor cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased\nvolume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This\nimpact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and\n12\nregulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber\nincident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational\nlosses.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition"

                "content": "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOrganization and Business Segments\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer),\nPharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby\ncare, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These\nproducts are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors\nthroughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology,\ninfectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nProducts in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care\nprofessionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the\northopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These\nproducts are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields\nby physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the\nworld. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies\ninvolved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and\nprocesses, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the\nunderlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all\nareas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In\naddition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves\nsignificant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nManagement’s Objectives\nWith “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly\nchange the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to\nensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is\npoised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it\ncompetes.\nThe Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high\nquality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for\napproximately 25% of 2020 sales. In 2020, $12.2 billion was invested in research and development and $7.3 billion\nspent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value\nthrough partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nA critical driver of the Company’s success is the 134,500 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and\ninspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the\nCompany’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging\nthe extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This\nensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an\nenduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees,\ncommunities and shareholders.\n19\nResults of Operations\nAnalysis of Consolidated Sales\nFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 see\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, Item 7. Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIn 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales\nchanges consisted of the following:\nSales increase/(decrease) due to:    2020       2019\nVolume                                3.5  %     3.7  %\nPrice                                -2.3       -0.9\nCurrency                             -0.6       -2.2\nTotal                                 0.6  %     0.6  %\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020\nand a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019.\nSales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in\n2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This\nrepresents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019.\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%,\nrespectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9%\nand 2.1%, respectively.\nIn 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included\noperational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere\n(excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational\ngrowth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region\nexperienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1%\npartially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%.\nThe 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by\napproximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of\noperating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\nIn 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented\napproximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers\ndistributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total\nconsolidated revenues.\nNote: values may have been rounded\n20\nAnalysis of Sales by Business Segments\nConsumer Health Segment\nConsumer Health segment sales in 2020 were $14.1 billion, an increase of 1.1% from 2019, which included 3.0%\noperational growth and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.4 billion, an\nincrease of 9.0%. International sales were $7.7 billion, a decrease of 4.6%, which included an operational decline\nof 1.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.3%.

Growth was primarily\nattributable to sales from TYLENOL ® driven by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTEC ® due to competitor product out of\nstock and PEPCID ® due to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S., and increased consumption in anti-\nsmoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu.\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year.\nThe decline was primarily due to negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by\ngrowth in eCommerce and new product innovation.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable\nto sales of LISTERINE ® mouthwash due to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related\nto COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline\nwas primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S.\npartially offset by strength in AVEENO ® baby.\nThe Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The\ndecline was primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts.\nThe Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year.\nGrowth was due to strong performance of NEOSPORIN ® and BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related\ndemand in the Asia Pacific region.\n21\nPharmaceutical Segment\nPharmaceutical segment sales in 2020 were $45.6 billion, an increase of 8.0% from 2019, which included operational\ngrowth of 8.2% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%.

This was partially offset by COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of\nREMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.\nThe patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar\nversions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction\nin sales of REMICADE ® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further\nreduction in sales of REMICADE ® in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version\nof REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab\nbiosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® .\nInfectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the\nprior year primarily due to strong sales of SYMTUZA ® and JULUCA ® . This was partially offset by lower sales of\nPREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in\ncertain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year.\nPaliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone\npalmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence. The growth was partially offset\nby migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA ® (methylphenidate) due to competitive\nentrants.\nOncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the\nprior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in\nall lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and E.U.; IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due\nto market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of\nERLEADA ® (apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA ®\n(abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE ® (bortezomib) due to generic competition.\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to\nthe prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains\nand market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration\nto OPSUMIT ® .\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year.\nSales growth of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix\ndynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive\npressures. The growth of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates.

The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of\nstrategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness,\nenhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and\nare subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects\nthese actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be\nsubstantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9\nto $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash\noutlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines\nof the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense\nand $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded\nsince the restructuring was announced.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During\nthe fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the\nrequirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion\nin the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional\npre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.0 billion at the end of 2020 as compared to $17.3 billion at the end of 2019.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.3 billion decrease were:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$                   17.3    Q4 2019 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n23.5    cash generated from operating activities\n-20.8    net cash used by investing activities\n-6.1    net cash used by financing activities\n0.1    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$                   14.0    Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $11.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $2.0 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2019.

As of January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year\nof $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third\nquarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019.\nConsidering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash\nflows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that\noperating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed\ncredit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund\noperating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the\nmajority may be paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets\non an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal\n30\nthird quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8\nbillion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for\na total of $7.5 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on\nOctober 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes . Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA),\nthe Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nJanuary 3, 2021: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nTax Legislation                             Interest on\n(Dollars in Millions)                (TCJA)    Debt Obligations    Debt Obligations     Total\n2021                     $              812               1,799                 949     3,560\n2022                                    812               2,226                 908     3,946\n2023                                  1,522               1,552                 880     3,954\n2024                                  2,029               1,598                 842     4,469\n2025                                  2,536               1,744                 789     5,069\nAfter 2025                                —              25,515               9,503    35,018\nTotal                    $            7,711              34,434              13,871    56,016\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related\nto business combinations or the Company’s approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated\nwith its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $121 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3,\n2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $148 million. In either\nscenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario,\nat maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which\nexpires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either\nbids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve\nor other applicable market\nrate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\n31\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in\nborrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and\ncurrent marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total\ndebt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in\n2019. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share\nin 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9,\n2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3,\n2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 3, 2021,\nthe Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result\nin material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as\nvariable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the\nfiscal years 2020 and 2019.\n32\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share\npayments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29,\n2019.\nConsumer Health Segment\n(Dollars in Millions)                        Balance at                                           Balance at\n2020                                Beginning of

Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation\nwould be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange\nrates.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the\nrequirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion\nin fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax\n$1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealth care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market\nvalue was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance\nshare units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share\ngoal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at\nthe time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the\nvesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was\nestimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 3, 2021.\n35\nEconomic and Market Factors\nCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity\nThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on\nits business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:\nOperating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility\ndesigned into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.\nSupply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities\nwhile closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas\nto ensure adequate and effective distribution.\nBusiness Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been\ninstrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and\nconsumer needs remains uninterrupted.\nWorkforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing,\ndistribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been\nestablished for other employees.\nLiquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital\nmarkets for the foreseeable future. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5\nbillion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition on\nOctober 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes.\nDomestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global\nlegislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently,\nthe recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production\nwith third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future\nsupplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if\ncapacity is not required. Amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing\norganizations of approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued\nliabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each\nagreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with\ngovernment related organizations.\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2010 - 2020, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's\nresults in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through\ncost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union\n(E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, however, there\nwas a transition period to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade deal. On December 30, 2020, the U.K., E.U.\nand the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Over the\nlast few years, Brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange\nrates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. While the\nUK and EU have now agreed on a future trade and cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate\nfinancial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. However,\nthe Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 3, 2021, the business of the\nCompany’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the Company’s consolidated assets and less than 3% of the\nCompany's fiscal twelve months revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $384 million and net income by approximately $115\nmillion.\n36\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the\nrevaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including\ndelaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and\nforegoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to\nimpact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal\nproceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is\ndetermined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 16, 2021,\nthere were 132,376 record holders of Common Stock of the Company."

Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 134,500employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all\ncountries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into threebusiness segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer),\nPharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby\ncare, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These\nproducts are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors\nthroughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology,\ninfectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nProducts in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care\nprofessionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the\northopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields, which are\ndistributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians,\nnurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements\nThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update clarifies the\ninteraction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The\nupdate clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted\nfor under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting\nconsideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer\nfor that transaction. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\nThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update introduces the current\nexpected credit loss (CECL) model, which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial\ninstruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at\neach reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate\nof credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard\ndid not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2018-14: Compensation - Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company adopted this standard in the fiscal year ended 2020. This standard revised the financial statement note\ndisclosure requirements of ASC 715-20 for defined benefit plan sponsors. The adoption of this standard had no\nimpact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\ndefined benefit plan disclosures.\n45\nAccounting Standards adopted in the fiscal 2018 with a cumulative effect to the 2018 opening balance of Retained\nEarnings\nThe following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained\nearnings upon adoption of these accounting standards in 2018:\nCumulative Effect Adjustment Increase (Decrease) to\n(Dollars in Millions)                                                            Retained Earnings\nASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts        $                                                  -47\nwith Customers\nASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments                                                            232\nASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity                                                      -439\nTransfers\nTotal                                       $                                                 -254\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 3, 2021\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any,\nfrom the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no new\nmaterial accounting standards issued in fiscal 2020 that impacted the Company.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are\nclassified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity\nsecurities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company\nreviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment    20-30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between\n46\nthe asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate\nfair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and\nrecorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on\nthe consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 7.2billion and $ 7.0billion as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each\nof the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share\npayments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.0billion, $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019\nand 2018, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2020 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived\nintangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\n47\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.0billion and $ 1.0billion in 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The lease liability was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating\nlease costs were $ 0.3billion, $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash paid for\namounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development.\n48\nAmounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of\nresearch and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the\nCompany’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n*    Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful\nlife.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® ,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses.Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet\nadvertising, were $ 2.1billion, $ 2.2billion and $ 2.6billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will\ncontinue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2020 was approximately $ 7.7billion, of which $\n6.9billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next\n12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In 2018, the Company elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company\n49\nintends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later\ndate to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on\nthese amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $\n0.7billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3,\n2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 3,\n2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could\nresult in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n50\n2.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of January 3, 2021, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted\nto $ 1.1billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors\ncounter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company\nprimarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\nRefer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $\n37.8billion and $ 30.6billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional amounts outstanding\nfor forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $ 45.3billion and $ 20.1billion,\nrespectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which\nare immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019. Gains and losses on net investment\nhedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The\nportion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On\nan ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting\nchanges of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 3, 2021, the balance of deferred net gain on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 652million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may\ndiffer as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange\nrates at maturity of the derivative.\n54\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, net of tax:\nJanua…                                             Decem…\n3,                                                29,\n2021                                               2019\n(Dol…                   Cost              Inter…      Other              Cost of              Intere…     Other\nin           Sales        of       R&D    (Inco…    (Incom…     Sales    Produc…       R&D    (Incom…    (Inco…\nMill…                 Produ…    Expen…    Expen…    Expense                 Sold    Expen…    Expense    Expen…\nSold\nThe\neffe…\nof\nfair\nvalu…\nnet\ninve…\nand\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nnet\ninve…\nhedg…\nrela…\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…\nreco…\nin\ninco…    $       —         —         —       153          —         —          —         —        159         —\non\nderi…\namou…\nexcl…\nfrom\neffe…\ntest…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               —         —         —       153          —         —          —         —        159         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nGain\n(Los…\non\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nrela…\nForw…\nfore…\nexch…\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…           12      -329      -137         —        -16       -54       -321      -105          —        22\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor              44       298      -191         —        -52       -20       -606       -94          —        39\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…            —         —         —       370          —         —          —         —        292         —\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor       $       —         —         —       748          —         —          —         —        417         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nThe following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\nGain/(Loss)\n(Dollars in Millions)            Location of Gain /(Loss)                    Recognized In\nDerivatives Not Designated as    Recognized in Income                 Income on Derivative\nHedging Instruments              on Derivative                             January 3, 2021    December 29, 2019\nForeign Exchange Contracts       Other (income) expense            $                    24                 -144\n55\nThe following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December\n29, 2019:\nLocation of\nGain or (Loss)\nReclassified\nfrom               Gain/(Loss)\nAccumulated        Reclassified\nGain/(Loss)                       Other              From\nRecognized In                       Comprehensive      Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in          Accumulated OCI       December 29,    Income Into        Into Income        December 29,\nMillions)            January 3, 2021               2019    Income             January 3, 2021    2019\nInterest\nDebt              $             -473                121    (income)           —                  —\nexpense\nCross Currency                                             Interest\ninterest rate     $               65                488    (income)           —                  —\nswaps                                                      expense\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values.

There were $ 21million and $ 19million, respectively, of changes in fair\nvalue reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or\n56\nthat the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or\nfinancial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities\nwhich are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain\nregulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant\njudgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:          2020                                        2019\nAssets:                                              Level 1    Level 2    Level 3     Total    Total(1)\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —        849          —       849         209\nInterest rate contracts(2)(3)                              —        240          —       240         693\nTotal                                             $        —      1,089          —     1,089         902\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —        702          —       702         426\nInterest rate contracts(3)                                 —      1,569          —     1,569         193\nTotal                                             $        —      2,271          —     2,271         619\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —         49          —        49          23\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —         38          —        38          33\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(4)                                  1,481          —          —     1,481       1,148\nDebt securities(5)                                         —     14,042          —    14,042       4,368\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(6)                                $                   633       633       1,715\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\n(Dollars in Millions)                          2020    2019\nTotal Gross Assets                        $   1,138     925\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -1,107    -841\nTotal Net Asset                                  31      84\nTotal Gross Liabilities                       2,309     652\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -2,172    -586\nTotal Net Liabilities                     $     137      66\n57\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                      2020     2019    2018\nBeginning Balance                     $   1,715      397     600\nChanges in estimated fair value(7)       -1,089      151    -156\nAdditions                                   106    1,246     125\nPayments                                    -99      -79    -172\nEnding Balance                        $     633    1,715     397\n(1) 2019 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,148million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 1,715million, classified as Level\n3.\n(2) Includes $ 1million of non-current assets as of December 29, 2019.\n(3) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(4) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(5) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(6) Includes $ 594million, $ 1,631million (primarily related to Auris Health) and $ 397million, classified as non-\ncurrent other liabilities as of January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.

Further information provided below.\n(4) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate, which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV\nFinancing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow\ncompanies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to\nbe depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research\nand development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1)\ntax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not\nto exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year\n2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that\nperiod.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\nremaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\nadditional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss\nTax Reform of approximately $ 0.4billion or 2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this\nbenefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 450million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates\nrelated to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by\napproximately 1.2% which is\n61\nreflected as a “Tax Benefits on Capital Loss” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition in the fiscal\nyear 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to Talc for $ 4.0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\nbefore taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0billion associated with a revised agreement\nin principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also generated additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or\nvested; reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18); and\nreversal of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in\ncertain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\nThe fiscal year 2019 tax rate decreased by 2.3% compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the\nimpact of TRAF discussed in more detail below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows:\nThe Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal\nfourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously\nrecognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized\nin the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local\nauthorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6billion and a related deferred tax asset of $\n0.2billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4billion decreasing the annual\neffective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4billion (see Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%\nand decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1%.\nIn December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in\nthe Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part\nof the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to\nthese foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its\nunrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately\n1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to\nuncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International\nOperations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company\nreceived and agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately\nreserved for potential exposures.\nThere were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual\neffective tax rate of 1.2%. These items included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional\nTCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part of the 2017 tax return.\nMore income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018.\nAs described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense\nof $ 0.1billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax\nexpense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following\nprovisions:\napproximately $ 0.6billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense\nhas been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 0.9billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 450million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the\nFederal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective\ntax rate reconciliation.\n62\nIn the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of\nthe TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $\n0.2billion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as\napplying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that\nexisted as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for\nforeign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31,\n2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge.\nAs described in Note 1, in the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the\ndeferred method and recorded a deferred tax cost of approximately $ 1.4billion in the fiscal year 2018 related to\nfacts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. During 2018, the Company reorganized the\nownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding\ntaxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following\nthe completion of this restructuring and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the\napplicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability\nof $ 2.8billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.9billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred\ntax benefit of $ 1.9billion. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n2020 Deferred Tax                 2019 Deferred Tax*\n(Dollars in Millions)                                   Asset    Liability                 Asset    Liability\nEmployee related obligations             $              2,434                              2,473\nStock based compensation                                  627                                595\nDepreciation & amortization                               721                              1,122\nNon-deductible intangibles                                          -6,567                             -5,835\nInternational R&D capitalized for tax                   1,517                              1,189\nReserves & liabilities                                  3,466                              2,337\nIncome reported for tax purposes                        1,705                              1,605\nNet operating loss carryforward                           990                                838\ninternational\nUndistributed foreign earnings                            812       -1,435                   765       -1,289\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income                                  -3,606                             -2,965\nMiscellaneous international                               854         -211                   696          -81\nMiscellaneous U.S.                                         12                                411\nTotal deferred income taxes              $             13,138      -11,819                12,031      -10,170\n* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that\nit is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these\ndeferred tax assets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:\n(Dollars in Millions)                        2020     2019     2018\nBeginning of year                        $  3,853    3,326    3,151\nIncreases related to current year tax         265      249      242\npositions\nIncreases related to prior period tax         668      408      145\npositions\nDecreases related to prior period tax        -551     -105     -137\npositions\nSettlements                                  -839       -9      -40\nLapse of statute of limitations               -23      -16      -35\nEnd of year                              $  3,373    3,853    3,326\nThe unrecognized tax benefits of $ 3.4billion at January 3, 2021, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual\neffective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax\naudits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012. As of December 29, 2019, the Company\nclassified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest\n63\nof approximately $ 0.9billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $ 0.7billion to the\nU.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized\nafter tax interest expense of $ 32million, $ 50million and $ 53million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 468million and $ 559million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\nAt the end of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nwere:\n(Dollars in Millions)                  2020      2019\nPension benefits                  $   5,761     5,538\nPostretirement benefits               2,229     2,297\nPostemployment benefits               3,078     3,004\nDeferred compensation                   250       338\nTotal employee obligations           11,318    11,177\nLess current benefits payable           547       514\nEmployee related obligations —    $  10,771    10,663\nnon-current\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $ 656million and $ 551million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included\nin Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n64\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases\nthe\nPBO as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $ 1.8billion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in\nBenefit Obligation.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2020 and 2019 the Company used December 31, 2020and December 31, 2019, respectively, as the measurement date for\nall U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2020,\n2019 and 2018 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans                        Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions)                           2020      2019      2018                   2020    2019    2018\nService cost                     $             1,380     1,163     1,283                    287     274     269\nInterest cost                                    955     1,096       996                    133     185     148\nExpected return on plan                       -2,461    -2,322    -2,212                     -7      -6      -7\nassets\nAmortization of prior service                      2         4         3                    -31     -31     -31\ncost\nRecognized actuarial losses                      891       579       852                    142     129     123\n(gains)\nCurtailments and settlements                      23        73         1                      —       —       —\nNet periodic benefit cost        $               790       593       923                    524     551     502\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\n65\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement Plans                       Other Benefit Plans\nWorldwide Benefit Plans                          2020       2019    2018                   2020    2019    2018\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nService cost discount rate                       2.82  %    3.63    3.20                   3.04    4.45    3.85\nInterest cost discount rate                      3.13  %    4.13    3.60                   3.08    4.25    3.62\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.00  %    3.99    3.98                   4.25    4.29    4.29\nlevels\nExpected long-term rate of return\non                                               8.12  %    8.31    8.46\nplan assets\nBenefit Obligation\nDiscount rate                                    2.14  %    2.91    3.76                   2.23    3.39    4.40\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.00  %    4.01    3.97                   4.27    4.29    4.29\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board\nconsiders factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment\nvehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of\nactives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of\nlocal markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants\nand are expected to be on-going plans.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator.

The other current and non current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance\nsheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 209million, $\n267million and $ 265million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n15.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal\nyears ended January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018:\n(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)            2020       2019       2018\nBasic net earnings per share                $     5.59       5.72       5.70\nAverage shares outstanding — basic             2,632.8    2,645.1    2,681.5\nPotential shares exercisable under stock         118.3      136.3      139.0\noption plans\nLess: shares repurchased under treasury          -80.4      -97.8      -92.5\nstock method\nConvertible debt shares                              —        0.7        0.7\nAdjusted average shares outstanding —          2,670.7    2,684.3    2,728.7\ndiluted\nDiluted net earnings per share              $     5.51       5.63       5.61\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18million shares related to stock\noptions, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. As of January 3, 2021,\nthe Company did not have convertible debt.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares\nrelated to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the\nCompany’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect\nof convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1million after-tax.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included all shares related to stock options,\nas the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. The diluted net\nearnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was\noffset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1million after-tax.\n16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 3, 2021, the Company had 2stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under\nthe Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive\nPlan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012\nLong-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650million shares of\ncommon stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nsubsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were\n277million at the end of fiscal year 2020.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,005million, $ 977million and $\n978million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 210million, $ 227million and $ 192million for fiscal\nyears 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n248million, $ 209million and $ 264million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total\n72\nunrecognized compensation cost was $ 804million, $ 823million and $ 827million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and\n2018, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.76years, 1.71years and\n1.73years for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part\nof inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2020, 2019 and 2018 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option.

The\nCompany also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the\nend of a three-yearperformance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is\ntied to the completion of service periods that range from 6months to 3years and the achievement, over a three-\nyearperiod, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder\nreturn: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return.\nBeginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with\nor help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-yearperiod will vary, based only\non actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted .\nA summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 3, 2021\nis presented below:\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Restricted Share Units    Outstanding Performance Share Units\nShares at December 29, 2019                                16,769                                  2,174\nGranted                                                     5,051                                    816\nIssued                                                     -6,042                                   -702\nCanceled/forfeited/adjusted                                  -780                                    -52\nShares at January 3, 2021                                  14,998                                  2,236\nThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 139.58, $ 121.31and $ 119.67in fiscal years\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant.

For additional details on the global supply\nchain restructuring see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nDue to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company\ncontinues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation evolves.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is\ndetermined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as\nestimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent\nprojected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and\nwith different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information\nbecomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing\nSystem; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing\ntalc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of\nJanuary 3, 2021, in the United States there were approximately 560plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits\nregarding\n84\ninjuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 7,800with\nrespect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 14,900with respect to pelvic meshes; 9,300with respect to\nRISPERDAL ® ; 12,600with respect to XARELTO ® ; 25,000with respect to body powders containing talc; 300with respect\nto INVOKANA ® ; and 4,200with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh.\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been\nmade against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain\nlawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United\nStates have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United\nKingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a\nCourt-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims\nwith eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision\nsurgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further\nextended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and\nprior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, therefore bringing to\nresolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States\nremain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class\naction settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In\nCanada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country . The Company\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a\nworldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement\nprogram and DePuy ASR ™ Hip-related product liability litigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson\n(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product\nliability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential\ncosts and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized\nas a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation\nhas also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts\nhave been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first\nquarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the\nsettlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product\nliability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of\nEthicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal\ncourts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions\nwhere the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the\nMDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs\nassociated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition,\nclass actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of\nthe United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and class actions in Israel,\nAustralia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In November\n2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation\nto the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments\nand testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and\npelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company is\nappealing the decision. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process\nwhich will require proof of use and causally related loss. The form of the individual case assessment process has\nnot yet been determined by the Court. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a\nsettlement of a group of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation\nassociated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh product s.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for\npersonal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of\nthe use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-\ncounty litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases\npending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh\ndevices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States. Discovery is proceeding in\nthese cases and certain of the cases are in preparation for trials.\n85\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the\nPROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court\nentered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.\nAdditional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the\nUS. Discovery is underway in these cases.\nIn September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized\nmanagement of 107 PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System (“PHS”) cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court granted\nplaintiffs application in January 2020 and those cases have also been transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court. Discovery is underway in these cases.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\nPHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia\nSystem products.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out\nof the use of RISPERDAL ® , and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or\nmixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits have been\nprimarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various\ncourts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues\nto receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has\nsuccessfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict\nin October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced\nin January 2020 to $ 6.8million by the trial judge. The Company and plaintiff are each appealing this judgment. The\nCompany has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these\nsettlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO ® , Bayer\nAG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition,\ncases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state\nmass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California.\nClass action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an agreement in\nprinciple to the settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May\n2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved\nthe majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated\nwith the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation.\nPersonal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and\nJohnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. The\nnumber of pending personal injury lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information\nwith respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state\ncourts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, and suits have also been filed outside the United States. The\nmajority of cases are pending in federal court, organized into a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United\nStates District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, the parties sought to exclude experts through\nDaubert motions. In April 2020, the Court issued rulings that limit the scope of testimony, including some theories\nand testing methods, for certain plaintiff expert witnesses and denied plaintiffs’ attempt to limit the scope of\ntestimony of certain of the Company’s witnesses. With this ruling made, case-specific discovery has begun per the\nCourt’s directive.\nIn talc cases that have previously gone to trial, the Company has obtained defense verdicts in a number of them,\nbut there have also been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020,\nthe Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham\nv. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion and, with\nadditional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $ 2.5billion (the\nIngham decision). An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied,\nand the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. The Company continues to believe\nthat it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts that it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company\nhas and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for the resolution\nof certain cases and claims, including the Ingham decision currently on appeal , in connection with product\nliability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing\na reorganization under\n86\nthe United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys\nBankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to\ntalcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has\nagainst the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. The Company previously proposed to\nresolve Imerys' (and the Company’s) obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of\nlitigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, waiving the Company’s indemnification claims\nagainst Imerys, and lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the bankruptcy forum\nwith the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys. In May 2020, Imerys and the asbestos\nclaimants’ committee (Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement\nrelated thereto agreeing to put its North American operations up for auction which was subsequently amended. The\nCompany has objected to the Disclosure Statement and intends to object to the Plan of Reorganization as currently\nstructured. Additionally, in June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (Cyprus) filed an adversary\nproceeding against the Company as well as Imerys seeking a declaration of indemnity under certain contractual\nagreements. The Company denies such indemnification is owed and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint\narguing, among other things, that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Cyprus’s claims against\nthe Company. The Plan Proponents filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement to which the\nCompany objected. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court\nentered an order approving the Disclosure Statement for the Ninth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization\nof Imerys Talc America, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates allowing Debtors to proceed with soliciting votes on the\nPlan. The Company intends to continue to object to the Plan. A hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan has\nbeen scheduled for June 2021.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers\nin the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the\nfederal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc,\nprimarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.\nPlaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion\nwas complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020,\nDefendants answered the complaint. Discovery is underway.\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books\nand records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a\ncross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. The Court has not\nyet ruled in the books and records action. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders\nfiled four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current\ndirectors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,\nalleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing\ntalc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those\nalleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re\nJohnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation .\nIn July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the\nBoard to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the\nBoard received raising similar issues. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in th e In re\nJohnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The independent counsel recommended that the Company\nreject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the\nderivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In\nOctober 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to\ndismiss the consolidated complaint.\nIn January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan\nagainst Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by\noffering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do\nso because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed\na motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020,\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.

In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide\nrequired Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter.\nIn October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019,\nthe Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs\nfiled a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth\nAmended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued\nan Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice.\n87\nIn January 2020, the Abtahi Law Group filed an action under Proposition 65 against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson &\nJohnson Consumer Inc. as well as a number of other alleged talcum powder manufacturers and distributors, including\none California company. In that action, the plaintiff alleges contamination of talcum powder products with unsafe\nlevels of arsenic, hexavalent chromium and lead. The plaintiff seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.\nDefendants filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2021, and a hearing has been scheduled for April 2021.\nLimited informal discovery is continuing.\nIn addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these\nmatters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the\nDepartment of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on\nEconomic and Consumer Policy. The Company produced documents as required in response and will continue to cooperate\nwith government inquiries. In November 2020, the SEC terminated its investigation.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA ® , a prescription medication\nindicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal\ncourts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for\nthe District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in\nCanada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases.

Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedical Devices\nIn November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE ® Knee\nSystem.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents.\nIn the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires\nbefore the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the\nability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the\npotential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a\nnon-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may\nsettle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products\nat issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.

Such regulation has been the basis of government\ninvestigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nJohnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous\nother pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts\ninvolving allegations\n93\nthat the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable\nconduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for\nthe drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The\nplaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the\npurchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the\ndrugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court,\nwere consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP\nDefendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved\nthrough court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative\nclass action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen\nBiotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along\nwith other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 3,100lawsuits related to the marketing of\nopioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously\nowned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both\nsubsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments.\nSimilar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the\nfollowing: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and\nhealth insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI,\nhave been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nMississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas,\nWashington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court\nby city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,\nConnecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi,\nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more than\n370 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,800 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-\nDistrict Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In\naddition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019, an anti-trust complaint was filed\nby private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a\nvariety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public\nnuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits\ngenerally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are\nseeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result\nin the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of\nabatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nThe trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and\nJPI in the amount of $ 572million, subject to a final order to be issued by the Court. The Court issued a final\njudgment reducing the amount to $ 465million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have appealed the judgment. The Company\nbelieves that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced\na settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio.\nJohnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information\nrelated to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New\nHampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were\ncontacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a\nmulti-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in\nprinciple that would include the Company paying $ 4billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the\nCompany agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve\nopioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $\n5billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in\nprinciple is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims\nby states, cities and counties. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and\nindividual cases are ongoing.\nIn August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and\ndistribution of its\n94\nopioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and\ndistributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson &\nJohnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-\nwide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n101\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.2 billion as of January\n3, 2021. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate\nprograms, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,\npatient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments\nabout future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. There have been\nverdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion, which was reversed\nin part and affirmed in part by the Missouri Court of Appeals in June 2020, reducing the overall award to $2.1\nbillion and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently\n$2.5 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and\nthe Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. As described by management, the Company\ncontinues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts it\nhas appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances\nthe Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for\nsettlement of certain cases and claims, as well as one case currently on appeal, in connection with product\nliability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred and when\n102\ndetermining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made, which in turn\nled to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\nmanagement’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual\nand potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed\nnecessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for\nsignificant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an\nunfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency\nof the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\nLitigation – Opioids\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered\nagainst the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond\nthe amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present\nlegal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty\nand unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has\nbeen named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The\ntrial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company in the amount\nof $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has appealed the judgment and, as\ndescribed by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019,\nthe Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as\nsettlement of the lawsuits. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an\nall-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and\ntribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an\nagreement being finalized. As described by management, this agreement in principle is not an admission of liability\nor wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is\na critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the\nrange of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led\nto a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s\nassessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether\na loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known\nactual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 22, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n103\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of January 3, 2021. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January\n3, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021 has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which\nappears herein.\n/s/ Alex Gorsky                 /s/ Joseph J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated\nin this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs.

The Company has not\nexperienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of its\nemployees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate\nand refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment."

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with\nstrategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedical Devices\nThe Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics,\nSurgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products\n(Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and\nischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees,\nTrauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon),\nsolutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson &\nJohnson Vision products such as ACUVUE ® Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to\ncataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and\nused predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nBeginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech\nsegment.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products\nand methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold\nin international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings and\n2\nclaims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—\nIntellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA ® . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring\nEuropean composition of matter patent expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO ®\n(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal\n2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns\ntwo patent families related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent\nfamilies. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European\npatent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO ® .\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the\nfourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for\nadvertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\nCompany’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital\nexpenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a\ncorresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets\noutside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in\nother countries are examples of such increased regulation.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\nmedical\n3\ndevices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize\nadulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to\ngrant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports,\nand/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of\nsubstantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our\nofficers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain\nconduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively\nmarketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result\nin a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in\ndifferent countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write\nprescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and\nregulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in\nthe healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare\ncompanies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and\nother transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to\ncertain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require\nstrict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign\ngovernment official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being\npaid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs\nof healthcare generally.\nU.S. government actors continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual\nmandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid\nexpansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not\noffering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being\nchallenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to\njudicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which challenges the\nconstitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to\nbuy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the\nMedicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of\nthe benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the\nstate level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape\nhas both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how\nvarious provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the\nCompany's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nThe global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and\nglobal economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many\nchallenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of\nregulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and\ndevices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\n4\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the number of employees were approximately:\n2021       2020\nEmployees1                               144,300    136,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    141,700    134,500\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\nworldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business\nconduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide\nadditional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global\nsurveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential\nhuman resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2021, 91% of global employees across 77 countries\nparticipated in Our Voice Survey which was offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and\nretain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and\nbe provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs\nand educational resources\n5\n5\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2021, 45.8% of employees in Manager and above\njob categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines\n(including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development\norganizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 8%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's\ncontinued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses\non three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges\nand opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:\nAccelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation\nBuild a diverse workforce for the future\nEnhance business results and reputation\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\neverywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial,\nphysical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement\nsavings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee\nassistance programs.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company\nadvances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—help ensure employee health protection from\nemerging health risks.\nSafety and COVID-19 Pandemic Response\nProtecting and supporting our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a top priority and our\napproach includes: keeping employees informed of local COVID-19 transmission rates and corresponding risk levels;\npromoting the health and safety of our employees in the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced\ncleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees with pay\ncontinuity, benefits and well-being tools; and recognizing extraordinary employee contributions at work and in our\ncommunities. In 2021, in recognition of the new way of working, we initiated J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers\nour office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work. This model\nallows for work to happen seamlessly across a variety of workplaces and is enabled by an array of enhanced\ncollaboration tools and technology to optimize productivity and connection. J&J Flex rolled out in fourth quarter\n2021 globally, and will continue deployment through 2022 as protocol and requirements related to the COVID-19\npandemic allow. The Company is evaluating flexible work strategies for its on-site workforce, such as virtual on-\nboarding and training, to help our employees balance their personal and professional lives. Also, we continued to\nenhance our benefits offerings with access to wellness tools, on-site vaccine clinics, mental health support\nresources and delivery of at-home testing kits. In addition, as COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and\nadministered in 2021, including the one developed by Johnson & Johnson, we adopted policies in the U.S., Puerto\nRico, and certain other countries to require proof of vaccination from Johnson & Johnson employees and contingent\nworkers, in order to return to our sites, where permitted by local law and regulation. In the U.S. and Puerto Rico,\nthis requirement took effect on October 4, 2021, with processes established for granting accommodations to those\nwith medical or religious needs. Select manufacturing and distribution employees and contractors in the U.S. and\nPuerto Rico, as well as certain additional countries, are adopting similar policies through early 2022.\n6\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

                "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s Medical Devices businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service\nare especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes\nand technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\nretailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name\nconsumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such\ndelays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact\nas well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party\nmanufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the\n8\nCompany would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays\nand increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions\nor future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global\noutbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected\nto continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of\nCOVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the\nCompany’s employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as\nthe Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The\nCompany continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our\nglobal supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our\nbusiness from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19\nwill impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence,\nincluding the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the\nimposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the\ndisease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among\nother things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and\nclinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results,\nand global economic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our\ncontinued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory\nauthorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy,\nsafety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including\nduring the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization\ntechnical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our\nthird-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive\nproducts; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the\navailability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs\nassociated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or\nprovide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be\nable to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience\nmanufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels\ncommensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively\nimpact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods\nindicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing\nand access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and those\nincorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of\nchanges in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that\ndevelopments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may\narise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.\n9\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in\nadditional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and\nChina, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly\nimpose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its\nintellectual property protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a\nwholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\nsignificant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\nlegal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates.\nRegulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality\nregulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and\npenalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and\nlitigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation,\ninvestigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate\nProgram, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws.\nScrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S.,\nand any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties\nincluding, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant\ncurrent investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal\nProceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n10\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of\noperations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report\nfor additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and\nindications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful\n11\nproducts and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose\nmarket share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced\nwithin the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or\nwhether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether\nparticular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be\ncommercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally .\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela\nas highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives\nto maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic\nprice increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact\nof currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange\nfluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;\n12\ntherefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the\nFCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company\noperates have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt\nand anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal\nsanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\nrequirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing\ncosts and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\nThe planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline\ncurrently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a new, publicly traded company. The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in\n18 to 24 months after initial announcement. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee\nrepresentative bodies, as required, final approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable\nopinion and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the\nreceipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned\nseparation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise\nadversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market\nconditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances.\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsome or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the\nCompany’s Consumer Health business.\nThe Company will incur significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may\nnot be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned\nseparation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which\nmay prove incorrect.\n13\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock,\nand the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of\nshares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock\nmay be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company intends to obtain an opinion from its U.S. tax advisors and a ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free\nnature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion and ruling\nwill be based on, among other things, various factual assumptions and representations that the Company and the New\nConsumer Health Company will make regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and\nother matters. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on\nthe opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. If subsequent to the planned separation it is determined that the\ntransaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax\nliability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for\ntax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to\nthe Company.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and\ncybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these\nsystems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The\nCompany continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and\nresponse capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and\ncontrols, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or\noperations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely\n14\nimpacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as\nfinancial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information\nsecurity or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or\nreputational losses.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance\nobligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such\nrequirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy\nenforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international\ndata flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are\nrequired to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company\nand involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border\ndata flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact\nour business operations and research activities."

                "content": "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOrganization and Business Segments\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The\nConsumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty,\nOver-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general\npublic and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical\nsegment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional\nSolutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,\nhospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the\nworld. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies\ninvolved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and\nprocesses, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the\nunderlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all\nareas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In\naddition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves\nsignificant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nManagement’s Objectives\nWith “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly\nchange the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to\nensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is\npoised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it\ncompetes.\nThe Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high\nquality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for\napproximately 25% of 2021 sales. In 2021, $14.7 billion was invested in research and development reflecting\nmanagement’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will\nprofoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nA critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 141,700 employees worldwide. Employees are\nempowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to\nuse the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency.\nLeveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with\nexcellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and\ninvest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals,\nemployees, communities and shareholders.\n21\nResults of Operations\nAnalysis of Consolidated Sales\nFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 see\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, Item 7. Management's Discussion\nand Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIn 2021, worldwide sales increased 13.6% to $93.8 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2020. These sales\nchanges consisted of the following:\nSales increase/(decrease) due to:    2021       2020\nVolume                               12.9  %     3.5  %\nPrice                                -0.7       -2.3\nCurrency                              1.4       -0.6\nTotal                                13.6  %     0.6  %\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.6% in 2021\nand a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020.\nSales by U.S. companies were $47.2 billion in 2021 and $43.1 billion in 2020. This represents increases of 9.3% in\n2021 and 2.5% in 2020. Sales by international companies were $46.6 billion in 2021 and $39.5 billion in 2020. This\nrepresents an increase of 18.2% in 2021 and a decrease of 1.3% in 2020.\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 5.5%, 4.5% and 6.5%,\nrespectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.7%, 5.0%\nand 2.6%, respectively.\nIn 2021, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 24.3% as compared to the prior year, which included\noperational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere\n(excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of\n7.3% and a positive currency impact of 0.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth\nof 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of\n2.7%.\nThe Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the\n2021 comparative sales growth by approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nAnnual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's\nworth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\nIn 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented\napproximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers\ndistributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total\nconsolidated revenues.\nNote: values may have been rounded\n22\nAnalysis of Sales by Business Segments\nConsumer Health Segment\nConsumer Health segment sales in 2021 were $14.6 billion, an increase of 4.1% from 2020, which included 2.8%\noperational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.3%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.5 billion, an\nincrease of 2.4%. International sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 5.6%, which included 3.1% operational\ngrowth and a positive currency impact of 2.5%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of\n1.0% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer Health segment.\nMajor Consumer Health Franchise Sales:\n% Change\n(Dollars in Millions)                2021      2020    ’21 vs. ’20\nOTC                             $   5,227     4,824            8.4  %\nSkin Health/Beauty                  4,541     4,450            2.0\nOral Care                           1,645     1,641            0.2\nBaby Care                           1,566     1,517            3.2\nWomen’s Health                        917       901            1.8\nWound Care/Other                      739       720            2.6\nTotal Consumer Health  Sales    $  14,635    14,053            4.1  %\nThe OTC franchise sales of $5.2 billion increased 8.4% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily\nattributable to Analgesics, TYLENOL ® and MOTRIN ® , digestive health and the hydration benefit offering (ORSL).\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.5 billion increased 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was\nprimarily due to COVID-19 recovery, strong performance of NEUTROGENA ® and AVEENO ® , and eCommerce acceleration\npartially offset by the divestiture of DR. CI:LABO - Sedona business in Asia Pacific and external supply\nconstraints.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Market growth in the\nU.S. along with strong performance in the Asia Pacific region due to successful brand building and promotional\ncampaigns and the positive impact of currency offset the negative impact of the floss divestiture and U.S. external\nsupply constraints.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 3.2% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by\nAVEENO ® Asia Pacific eCommerce strength, innovation and COVID-19 recovery.\nThe Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion increased 1.8% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by\nCOVID-19 market recovery, favorable price and strong brand building in Asia Pacific partially offset by disruptions\nin Europe due to flooding.\nThe Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion increased 2.6% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due\nto strong performance of BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages in the U.S. partially offset by product\ndiscontinuations and competitive pressures in Asia Pacific.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation\nin 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n23\nPharmaceutical Segment\nPharmaceutical segment sales in 2021 were $52.1 billion, an increase of 14.3% from 2020, which included operational\ngrowth of 13.1% and a positive currency impact of 1.2%. U.S. sales were $28.0 billion, an increase of 8.6%.\nInternational sales were $24.1 billion, an increase of 21.6%, which included 18.8% operational growth and a\npositive currency impact of 2.8%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.5% on the\noperational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous sales reserve estimates\nwere approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nMajor Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales*:\n% Change\n(Dollars in Millions)                            2021      2020    ’21 vs. ’20\nTotal Immunology                            $  16,750    15,055           11.3  %\nREMICADE®                                       3,190     3,747          -14.9\nSIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA®                          2,276     2,243            1.4\nSTELARA®                                        9,134     7,707           18.5\nTREMFYA®                                        2,127     1,347           57.9\nOther Immunology                                   24        11                 **\nTotal Infectious Diseases                       5,861     3,574           64.0\nCOVID-19 VACCINE                                2,385         —                 **\nEDURANT®/rilpivirine                              994       964            3.1\nPREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA®/SYMTUZA®        2,083     2,184           -4.6\nOther Infectious Diseases                         399       427           -6.5\nTotal Neuroscience                              7,011     6,548            7.1\nCONCERTA®/methylphenidate                         667       622            7.3\nINVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA                4,022     3,653           10.1\nTRINZA®/TREVICTA®\nRISPERDAL CONSTA®                                 592       642           -7.7\nOther Neuroscience                              1,729     1,632            6.0\nTotal Oncology                                 14,548    12,367           17.6\nDARZALEX®                                       6,023     4,190           43.8\nERLEADA®                                        1,291       760           70.0\nIMBRUVICA®                                      4,369     4,128            5.8\nZYTIGA®/abiraterone acetate                     2,297     2,470           -7.0\nOther Oncology(1)                                 568       821          -30.8\nTotal Pulmonary Hypertension                    3,450     3,148            9.6\nOPSUMIT®                                        1,819     1,639           11.0\nUPTRAVI®                                        1,237     1,093           13.1\nOther Pulmonary Hypertension                      395       416           -5.0\nTotal Cardiovascular / Metabolism /             4,460     4,878           -8.6\nOther\nXARELTO®                                        2,438     2,345            4.0\nINVOKANA®/ INVOKAMET®                             563       795          -29.3\nPROCRIT®/EPREX®                                   479       552          -13.3\nOther                                             981     1,186          -17.3\nTotal Pharmaceutical Sales                  $  52,080    45,572           14.3  %\n*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n** Percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful\n(1) Inclusive of VELCADE ® which was previously disclosed separately\n24\nImmunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the\nprior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA ® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and\nstrength in TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by\nlower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE ® .\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA ® (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA ®\n(ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss\nof market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales.\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared\nto the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially\noffset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition\nand loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior\nyear. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone\npalmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA\nHAFYERA™.\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the\nprior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by continued strong\nmarket growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the\ncontinued global launch uptake of ERLEADA ® (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by\nmarket and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive\npressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts.\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the\nprior year.

As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year\nof $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash,\ncash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was\n$33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19\ncrisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any\nsignificant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from\nexternal sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper\nmarkets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate\n$1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid\nlitigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities\n(See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors\nthe global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are\nfavorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company\nto deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead\nof in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the\nU.S Treasury of an incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a\ndeferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes and\ntherefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this change. The\nrequirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is\nnot affected by this provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has\naccess to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. During the fiscal third quarter of\n32\n2021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement associated with the acquisition of Actelion, the Company's\nundrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nJanuary 2, 2022: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nTax Legislation                             Interest on\n(Dollars in Millions)                (TCJA)    Debt Obligations    Debt Obligations     Total\n2022                     $              812               2,131                 909     3,852\n2023                                  1,522               1,551                 893     3,966\n2024                                  2,029               1,518                 843     4,390\n2025                                  2,536               1,732                 789     5,057\n2026                                      —               1,995                 744     2,739\nAfter 2026                                —              23,189               8,786    31,975\nTotal                    $            6,899              32,116              12,964    51,979\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related\nto business combinations or the Company’s approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated\nwith its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2,\n2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either\nscenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $2.2 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $0.1 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which\nexpires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable\nmargins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $33.8 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in\nborrowings was due to the repayment of debt. In 2021, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of\ndebt) was $2.1 billion compared to net debt of $10.1 billion in 2020. Total debt represented 31.3% of total capital\n(shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2021 and 35.8% of total capital in 2020. Shareholders’ equity per share at\nthe end of 2021 was $28.16 compared to $24.04 at year-end 2020.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n33\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share\nin 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8,\n2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2,\n2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022,\nthe Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result\nin material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the\nfiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements of certain products, which are included in\n34\nsales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and\nare included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3,\n2021.\nConsumer Health Segment\n(Dollars in Millions)                        Balance at                                           Balance at\n2021                                Beginning of

Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market\nvalue was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance\nshare units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share\ngoal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at\nthe time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the\nvesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was\nestimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 2, 2022.\n37\nEconomic and Market Factors\nCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity\nThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on\nits business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:\nOperating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility\ndesigned into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.\nSupply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities\nwhile closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas\nto help ensure adequate and effective distribution.\nBusiness Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been\ninstrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and\nconsumer needs remains uninterrupted.\nWorkforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing,\ndistribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been\nestablished for other employees.\nLiquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital\nmarkets for the foreseeable future.\nDomestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global\nlegislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently,\nthe recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations.\nIn fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine\nproduction with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with\nfuture supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such\nproduction if capacity is not required. Amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be\npaid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected in the prepaid\nexpenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated\nbalance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine\ndevelopment cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations.\nThe Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements, including its\ncontract with Emergent BioSolutions and related production activities at its Bayview, Maryland facility. The\nCompany has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in\nLeiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across\ndifferent countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site,\nor the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or\nresults.\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2011 - 2021, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate\nsurpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of\nincreasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity\nimprovements and periodic price increases.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2021 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.2\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealthcare products.\n38\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2022,\nthere were 127,899 record holders of Common Stock of the Company."

include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 141,700employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into threebusiness segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The\nConsumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty,\nOver-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general\npublic and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical\nsegment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional\nSolutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,\nhospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation\nin 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 2, 2022\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any,\nfrom the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material\naccounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\nASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates\nfor the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to\nalternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of\n2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and\nother market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of\nobservable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial\nreporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any\nhedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to\napply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate “SOFR” where applicable). The company\nalso applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that\npreviously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform\nprovisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have\n47\nat least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and\nobligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are\nclassified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity\nsecurities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company\nreviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nBuilding and building equipment    20-30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates,\nReturns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 7.7billion and $ 7.2billion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the\n48\nMedical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products\nfrom inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0%\nof annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share\npayments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1billion, $ 1.0billion and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020\nand 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived\nintangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach\n49\non leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not\nseparating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 0.9billion and $ 1.0billion in 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The lease liability was $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating\nlease costs were $ 0.3billion, $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for\namounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3billion, $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n*    Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful\nlife.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® ,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 2.7billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 2.2billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n50\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will\ncontinue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2021 was approximately $ 6.9billion, of which $\n6.1billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next\n12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.7billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2,\n2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets along with the Company’s\non-going vaccine development and distribution efforts. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future\nassessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n51\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n52\n2.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of January 2, 2022, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted\nto $ 570million net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors\ncounter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company\nprimarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\nRefer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 45.8billion, $ 37.4billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of January 3, 2021, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate\nswaps of $ 37.8billion and $ 30.6billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 336million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings\nmay differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange\nrates at maturity of the derivative.\n56\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, net of tax:\nJanua…                                             Janua…\n2,                                                 3,\n2022                                               2021\n(Dol…                   Cost              Inter…      Other              Cost of              Intere…     Other\nin           Sales        of       R&D    (Inco…    (Incom…     Sales    Produc…       R&D    (Incom…    (Inco…\nMill…                 Produ…    Expen…    Expen…    Expense                 Sold    Expen…    Expense    Expen…\nSold\nThe\neffe…\nof\nfair\nvalu…\nnet\ninve…\nand\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nfair\nvalue\nhedg…\nrela…\nInte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nHedg…    $       —         —         —      -109          —         —          —         —          —         —\nitems\nDeri…\ndesi…\nas               —         —         —       109          —         —          —         —          —         —\nhedg…\ninst…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nnet\ninve…\nhedg…\nrela…\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…\nreco…\nin\ninco…    $       —         —         —       174          —         —          —         —        153         —\non\nderi…\namou…\nexcl…\nfrom\neffe…\ntest…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               —         —         —       174          —         —          —         —        153         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nGain\n(Los…\non\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nrela…\nForw…\nfore…\nexch…\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…           17       119        30         —         47        12       -329      -137          —       -16\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor             -94      -557       123         —        146        44        298       -91          —       -52\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…            —         —         —       402          —         —          —         —        370         —\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor       $       —         —         —         9          —         —          —         —        748         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nAs of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges\nLine item\nin the                                                              Cumulative\nConsolida…                                                           Amount of\nBalance                                                             Fair Value\nSheet in                                                               Hedging\nwhich the                                                           Adjustment\nhedged                                                                Included\nitem is                                                                 in the\nincluded            Carrying                                          Carrying\n(Dollars           Amount of                                         Amount of\nin                the Hedged  January 2,          January 3,        the Hedged  January 2,           January 3,\nMillions)          Liability  2022                2021               Liability  2022                 2021\nLong-term     $        9,793                $  —                 $        -142                 $  —\nDebt\n57\nGain/(Loss)\n(Dollars in Millions)             Location of Gain /(Loss)                     Recognized In\nDerivatives Not Designated as     Recognized in Income                  Income on Derivative\nHedging Instruments               on Derivative                              January 2, 2022    January 3, 2021\nForeign Exchange Contracts        Other (income) expense             $                   -70                 24\nLocation of\nGain or (Loss)\nReclassified\nfrom               Gain/(Loss)\nAccumulated        Reclassified\nGain/(Loss)                       Other              From\nRecognized In                       Comprehensive      Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in          Accumulated OCI                       Income Into        Into Income        January 3,\nMillions)            January 2, 2022    January 3, 2021    Income             January 2, 2022    2021\nInterest\nDebt              $              387               -473    (income)           —                  —\nexpense\nCross Currency                                             Interest\ninterest rate     $              548                 65    (income)           —                  —\nswaps                                                      expense\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values.

There were offsetting impacts of $ 422million and $ 21million, respectively, of changes\nin fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments.\nThe impact in fiscal 2021 was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:          2021                                        2020\nAssets:                                              Level 1    Level 2    Level 3     Total    Total(1)\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —        540          —       540         849\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —        796          —       796         240\nTotal                                             $        —      1,336          —     1,336       1,089\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —        881          —       881         702\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —        979          —       979       1,569\nTotal                                             $        —      1,860          —     1,860       2,271\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —         24          —        24          49\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —         28          —        28          38\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(3)                                  1,884          —          —     1,884       1,481\nDebt securities(4)                                         —     19,727          —    19,727      14,042\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(5)                                $                   533       533         633\n59\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\n(Dollars in Millions)                          2021      2020\nTotal Gross Assets                        $   1,360     1,138\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -1,285    -1,107\nTotal Net Asset                                  75        31\nTotal Gross Liabilities                       1,888     2,309\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -1,855    -2,172\nTotal Net Liabilities                     $      33       137\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                    2021      2020     2019\nBeginning Balance                     $   633     1,715      397\nChanges in estimated fair value(6)        -52    -1,089      151\nAdditions                                   —       106    1,246\nPayments                                  -48       -99      -79\nEnding Balance                        $   533       633    1,715\n(1) 2020 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,481million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 633million, classified as Level 3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 520million, $ 594million and $ 1,631million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of\nJanuary 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively.

Further information provided below.\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain\nwholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of\ncertain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring\nwas approximately $ 0.6billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these\nassets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international\nincome” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally\nother fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an effective tax rate of\n23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the\nAuris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4% (See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for more details).\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate. which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV\nFinancing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow\ncompanies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to\nbe depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research\nand development\n63\ntax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up\nsimilar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years.\nThe Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in\nfurther detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\nremaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\nadditional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss\nTax Reform of approximately $ 0.4billion or 2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this\nbenefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 450million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition,\nin the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\nbefore taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0billion associated with a revised agreement\nin principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note\n18) and reversed of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax\nexaminations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international\nsubsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local\ntaxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the\nfiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval\nby the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6billion and a related\ndeferred tax asset of $ 0.2billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4billion\ndecreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on\nthe Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The following items also impacted the fiscal year 2019 effective\ntax rate:\nThe impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4billion (see Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%\nand decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1%.\nIn December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in\nthe Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part\nof the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to\nthese foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its\nunrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately\n1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to\nuncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International\nOperations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n64\nAs described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense\nof $ 0.1billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax\nexpense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following\nprovisions:\napproximately $ 0.6billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense\nhas been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 0.9billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 450million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the\nFederal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective\ntax rate reconciliation.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n2021 Deferred Tax                       2020 Deferred Tax(1)\n(Dollars in Millions)                             Asset    Liability                         Asset    Liability\nEmployee related obligations       $              1,244                                      2,434\nStock based compensation                            679                                        627\nDepreciation of property, plant\nand                                                             -876                                       -823\nequipment\nGoodwill and intangibles                                      -2,659    -2                               -5,023\nR&D capitalized for tax                           1,664                                      1,517\nReserves & liabilities                            2,882                                      3,466\nIncome reported for tax                           2,566                                      1,777\npurposes\nNet realizable operating loss                     1,073                                        990\ncarryforward\nUndistributed foreign earnings                    1,015       -1,461                           812       -1,435\nGlobal intangible low-taxed                                   -4,853                                     -3,606\nincome\nMiscellaneous international                       1,006          -39                           854         -211\nMiscellaneous U.S.                                  495                                                     -59\nTotal deferred income taxes        $             12,624       -9,888                        12,477      -11,157\n( 1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n(2) Amount is inclusive of the $ 2.3billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership\nstructure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described.\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax\naudits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year\n2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately$ 0.7billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final\nsettlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized\nafter tax interest expense of $ 44million, $ 32million and $ 50million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 512million and $ 468million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\n(Dollars in Millions)                 2021      2020\nPension benefits                  $  4,088     5,761\nPostretirement benefits              2,069     2,229\nPostemployment benefits              3,117     3,078\nDeferred compensation                  181       250\nTotal employee obligations           9,455    11,318\nLess current benefits payable          557       547\nEmployee related obligations —    $  8,898    10,771\nnon-current\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $ 4,436million and $ 656million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, are\nincluded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n66\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases\nthe\nProjected Benefit Obligation as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $ 1.8billion and is included in the\n“Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit Obligation.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2021 and 2020 the Company used December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nRetirement Plans                        Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions)                           2021      2020      2019                   2021    2020    2019\nService cost                     $             1,421     1,380     1,163                    309     287     274\nInterest cost                                    770       955     1,096                     81     133     185\nExpected return on plan                       -2,645    -2,461    -2,322                     -7      -7      -6\nassets\nAmortization of prior service                   -181         2         4                    -31     -31     -31\ncost\nRecognized actuarial losses                    1,257       891       579                    151     142     129\n(gains)\nCurtailments and settlements                       1        23        73                      —       —       —\nNet periodic benefit cost        $               623       790       593                    503     524     551\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net\nperiodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings.\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator.

The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance\nsheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 236million, $\n209million and $ 267million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n15.\nEarnings Per Share\n(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)            2021       2020       2019\nBasic net earnings per share                $     7.93       5.59       5.72\nAverage shares outstanding — basic             2,632.1    2,632.8    2,645.1\nPotential shares exercisable under stock         138.0      118.3      136.3\noption plans\nLess: shares repurchased under treasury          -96.1      -80.4      -97.8\nstock method\nConvertible debt shares                              —          —        0.7\nAdjusted average shares outstanding —          2,674.0    2,670.7    2,684.3\ndiluted\nDiluted net earnings per share              $     7.81       5.51       5.63\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2021 included all shares related to stock options,\nas the exercise price of these options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock.

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect\nof convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1million after-tax.\n16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 2, 2022, the Company had 2stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under\nthe Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive\nPlan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012\nLong-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650million shares of\ncommon stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nsubsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were\n240million at the end of fiscal year 2021.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,135million, $ 1,005million and $\n977million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 218million, $ 210million and $ 227million for fiscal\nyears 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n223million, $ 248million and $ 209million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 862million, $\n804million and $ 823million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\n74\nrespectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.78years, 1.76years and 1.71years for\nfiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory\nwere insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n2021          2020          2019\nRisk-free rate               0.83    %     1.47    %     2.56    %\nExpected volatility         18.59    %    15.33    %    16.27    %\nExpected life (in years)           7.0           7.0           7.0\nExpected dividend yield      2.50    %     2.60    %     2.80    %\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nWeighted                       Value\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Shares       Average Exercise Price       (Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 30, 2018               109,652    $                   98.29    $                  3,214\nOptions granted                            19,745                       131.94\nOptions exercised                         -14,785                        82.43\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,975                       125.11\nShares at December 29, 2019               111,637                       105.63                       4,478\nOptions granted                            20,723                       151.41\nOptions exercised                         -16,275                        86.05\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -1,835                       137.62\nShares at January 3, 2021                 114,250                       116.22                       4,703\nOptions granted                            18,525                       164.62\nOptions exercised                         -13,248                        97.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,166                       149.75\nShares at January 2, 2022                 117,361    $                  125.36    $                  5,364\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 919million, $ 1,021million and $ 807million in fiscal years\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n75\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 2, 2022:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                 Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise           Options    Average              Average                     Options    Average\nPrice Range                   Life(1)              Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$65.08-$90…         16,007                  1.6                  $81.92         16,007                   $81.92\n$100.06-$1…         22,647                  3.6                 $101.07         22,647                  $101.07\n$115.67-$1…         24,543                  5.6                 $122.59         23,972                  $122.43\n$131.94-$1…         36,304                  7.6                 $142.23            100                  $140.72\n$151.42-$1…         17,860                  9.1                 $164.62             16                  $164.62\n117,361                  5.8                 $125.36         62,742                  $104.42\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were 114,250and an average life of 6.0years and\n111,637and an average life of 6.0years, respectively.

The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-yearperiod will vary, based only\non actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted .\nA summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 2, 2022\nis presented below:\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Restricted Share Units    Outstanding Performance Share Units\nShares at January 3, 2021                                  14,998                                  2,236\nGranted                                                     4,981                                    741\nIssued                                                     -5,101                                   -610\nCanceled/forfeited/adjusted                                  -756                                    -55\nShares at January 2, 2022                                  14,122                                  2,312\nThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 152.62, $ 139.58and $ 121.31in fiscal years\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted\nshare units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting\nperiod. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $ 611million, $ 650million and $ 586million in 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 179.35, $ 160.54and $ 124.67in fiscal\nyears 2021, 2020 and 2019, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals\nat the date of grant.\nThe fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the\ndate of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which\nare not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $ 83million, $ 91million and $ 119million in\nfiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n76\n17.\nSegments of Business* and Geographic

These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations\nhave been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5billion and\nhas been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which\nhas multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases\nand the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science\ncapabilities.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational\ncompound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech\nInc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8billion applying a probability of success factor that\nranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different\nindications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional\npayments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a\nbusiness combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year\n2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate\nthe development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment\ncharge of approximately $ 0.6billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab\n(JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment\ncharge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first\nquarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year\n2020.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares\nin Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares\npreviously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical\nDevices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets,\nprimarily IPR&D, for $ 0.4billion, goodwill for $ 0.2billion, other assets of $ 0.2billion and liabilities assumed\nof $ 0.3billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $\n0.4billion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $\n6.1billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable\nintangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0billion, goodwill of $ 1.2billion, other assets of $ 0.5billion and liabilities\nof $ 1.6billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal\ndisorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the\nasset, probability of success factors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect\ninherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The\ngoodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected\nto be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the\nPharmaceutical segment.\nDuring fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $ 5.8billion in cash and $ 1.4billion of liabilities\nassumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations\nhave been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 6.8billion and\nhas been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing,\ndevelopment and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health,\nInc. a\n84\nprivately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an U.S. FDA-cleared\nplatform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\nOn January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and\ndistribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of\napproximately ¥ 230billion, which equates to approximately $ 2.1billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06Japanese\nYen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company\nrecognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.3billion related to the\nCompany's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO.\nThe Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value\nof the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $ 1.5billion, goodwill for $\n1.2billion and liabilities of $ 0.4billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks\nand customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to\nsynergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $ 3.4billion, net of\ncash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $ 2.35billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon\nreaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies,\ninitially focused in lung cancer, with a U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and\ntherapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the\nMedical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $ 3.0billion, goodwill for $ 2.0billion, marketable securities\nof $ 0.2billion and liabilities assumed of $ 1.8billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments\nmentioned above. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business\nacquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the\nCompany finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of\napproximately $ 1.1billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain\ndevelopmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $ 0.1billion\nrelated to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. In the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the\nCompany recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion primarily related to expected development delays in the\ngeneral surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava). A probability of success factor ranging from 18% to 66% across\nOttava sub-platforms, was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of\nthe contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 9.5%.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or\nfinancial position.\nDivestitures\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\nPharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the\ncompany at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337million ($ 357million)\nbased on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the\nCompany had rights to approximately 38.7million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF\n445million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110million ($ 120million) of this\nloan into approximately 9.6million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of\napproximately $ 2.8billion, consisting of $ 2.7billion of cash proceeds and $ 0.1billion of retained net\nreceivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $\n2.0billion.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor\nits legal proceedings as the situation evolves and in person trials resume.\n85\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as\nestimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent\nprojected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and\nwith different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information\nbecomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing\nSystem; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing\ntalc, primarily JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of\nJanuary 2, 2022, in the United States there were approximately 250plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits\nregarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System;\n5,300with respect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 10,100with respect to pelvic meshes; 8,800with respect\nto RISPERDAL ® ; 5,500with respect to XARELTO ® ; 40,400with respect to body powders containing talc; 100with\nrespect to INVOKANA ® ; and 4,700with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. The number of\npending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are\nfiled.\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country . The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional\n86\ncosts associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs\nassociated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson\n(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product\nliability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential\ncosts and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized\nas a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation\nalso has been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts\nhave been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first\nquarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the\nsettlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product\nliability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal\ncourts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL.\nThe MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional\npelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved\nthe majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands\nand class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a\njudgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in\nrelation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the\ndevices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court\nissued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the\nintermediate appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full\nCourt entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An application for special leave to the High Court of Australia was\nfiled in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on the application in November 2021. Special leave was\nrefused. While this brings an end to the appellate process, there will now be an individual case assessment process\nfor the remaining group member claims. The parties currently are in discussions with the Court to determine the\nform and mechanism of that individual case assessment process. The next hearing is scheduled for late February\n2022. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an\nagreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are\ncurrently negotiating the wording and some of the terms thereof and once finalized, the settlement will be subject\nto court approval. The parties are due to update the court on the status of the finalization of the settlement\nnegotiations by the end of February 2022. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability\nlitigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal\ninjury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have\nbeen organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in Oklahoma\nstate court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the\nplaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately\n4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in\nSeptember 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings\nare currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. The deadline for issuance of Individual\nAllocation amounts by the Special Master is March 2022. The costs associated with this proposed settlement are\nreflected in the Company’s accruals. Post-Settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket\ncontrol orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of February 2022, there are\napproximately 90active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the\nPROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court\nentered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.\nAdditional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions\noutside the United States. Discovery is underway in the MCL proceedings.\n87\nEthicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE™\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\nPHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia\nSystem products.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out\nof the use of RISPERDAL ® , and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or\nmixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have\nbeen filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts\nin the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has\nsuccessfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict\nin October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $\n6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel\nrepresenting plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The\ncosts associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO ® , Bayer\nHealthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nIn addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated\ninto a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson & Johnson\nannounced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement\nwas executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January\n2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for\nits costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation.\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson\nConsumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ®\nBaby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States\nas well as outside of the United States, continued to increase through fiscal year 2021.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &\nJohnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer\nof the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari,\nseeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company\npaid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances,\nincluding the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought\nagainst the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc\nverdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in\ncertain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI.\nOn November 15, 2021, the North\n88\nCarolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and\nenjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson &\nJohnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties.\nThe LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in\nNovember 2021, and that court subsequently extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants have filed a\nmotion to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion\nto dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. While the PI effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-\nrelated personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the automatic stay on a small number of appeals where\nappeal bonds have been filed.\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are\nowed by LTL through the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has\nestablished a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. Subsequent to the\nfiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party, as a result of the\nbankruptcy filing. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet been\nable to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have\nrecently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate\nthe possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of\nthe United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware\n(Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from\nexposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the\nCompany for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A.,\nthe Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan\nProponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan\nProponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan\nProponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure\nStatement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the Company voted to reject\nthe Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the\nPlan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain\nimproprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the\nBankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn as improperly voted. In October 2021,\nImerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of Imerys’s insurers\n(the Mediation Parties) have since agreed to engage in mediation.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys\nadversary proceeding). The Imerys adversary proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with\nrespect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously\nfiled a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from\nundergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The\nBankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The\nBankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys adversary proceeding.\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc\nmines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration\nof indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus adversary proceeding). The Company denies such\nindemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a\nvoluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan.\nThe Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution\nto a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against Talc Claims asserted against it.\nCyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR\nappointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In\nOctober 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic\nstay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus adversary proceeding.\nIn February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the\nCoverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the\nautomatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic\nstay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a\nlimited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying\nthe stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action.\n89\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers\nin the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the\nfederal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc,\nprimarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.\nPlaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion\nwas complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020,\nthe Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was\ncompleted. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion\nfor class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement\nthe class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. Discovery is ongoing.\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books\nand records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a\ncross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. In February 2022,\nthe Court granted Johnson & Johnson's cross motion to dismiss. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020,\nfour shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and\nits current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders\ncontaining talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of\nthose alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption\nIn re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, a report was delivered to the\nCompany’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the\nderivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and\ndemanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs\nin th e In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The independent counsel recommended that\nthe Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal\nof the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report.\nIn October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to\ndismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily\nterminated Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss pending a decision on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In\nNovember 2021, at the Court’s request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for\ndiscovery.\nIn January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan\nagainst Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by\noffering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do\nso because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed\na motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020,\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of\nOctober 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion,\nand granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to\nfile an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice\nof appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in\nSeptember 2021, Defendants filed their response brief, and in October 2021, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief. In\nJanuary 2022, the Third Circuit heard oral argument.\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65\nwarnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company\nmoved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In\nApril 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a\nFourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended\ncomplaint.

Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedical Devices\nIn December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of Texas alleging that Acclarent’s RELIEVA ® Spin and RELIEVEA SpinPlus ® products infringe U.S.\nPatent No. 9,011,412.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of\nthe applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic\nstatutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic\ncompanies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their\nproducts to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the\napplicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In\naddition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can\ninvolve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the\nrelevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act,\nis also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the\napplicable patents.\nZYTIGA ®\nBeginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc.

Such regulation has been the basis of government\ninvestigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nJohnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous\nother pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts\ninvolving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and\notherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average\nWholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider\nreimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid\nfor any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on\n95\nAWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these\ncases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in\na multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims\nagainst the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought\nby the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case\nbrought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is\npending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA\nCorporation. All other cases have been resolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along\nwith other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in approximately 3,400lawsuits related to the marketing of\nopioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously\nowned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both\nsubsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments.\nSimilar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the\nfollowing: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and\nhealth insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and\nJPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nMississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,\nTexas, Washington and West Virginia.

There are close to 3,000federal cases coordinated in a\nfederal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In\naddition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by\nand on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In\nOctober 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending\ntransfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including\nfalse advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices,\nfalse claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and,\nin some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse\njudgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant\ndamages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson &\nJohnson and JPI in the amount of $ 465million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November\n2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI\nannounced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three\nCalifornia counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against Johnson & Johnson\nand JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers.

The settlement\nprovides New York and its participating subdivisions with up to $ 263million to address opioid-related issues,\nreimburses attorney fees and costs, and removes the\n96\nCompany and Janssen from a multi-defendant trial of opioid-related claims that commenced in Suffolk County in June\n2021. In exchange, the Company and JPI receive releases from the claims asserted by New York and the participating\nparties, including NYDFS.\nIn October 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of Texas and its participating\nsubdivisions, including Dallas County, Bexar County, and Tarrant County, resolving their opioid-related claims\nagainst the Company on terms consistent with the Company’s previously announced agreement to contribute up to $\n5billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The\nsettlement provides Texas and its participating subdivisions with up to $ 297million to address opioid-related\nissues and reimburse attorney fees and costs, and removes the Company and Janssen from multi-defendant bellwether\ntrials of opioid-related claims scheduled to commence in Texas state courts in early 2022. In exchange, the Company\nand JPI will receive releases from the claims asserted by Texas and the participating subdivisions.\nJohnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information\nrelated to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New\nHampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.

In October 2020, the\nCompany agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve\nopioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $\n5billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in\nprinciple is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of\nthe agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized and up to one-third of the all-in\nsettlement is expected to be paid within the next 12 months, depending upon the level of participation by the\nstates and their subdivisions. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the\nagreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. As of January 2022,\n45 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the settlement. The\nsubdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until\nlate February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation. Based on expected\nparticipation, the Company has committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating\nstates (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments, whose cases were scheduled\nfor trial in 2021, 2022, or 2023.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent\ncounsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to\nthe Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or\nappropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations\nof the independent counsel’s report.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson\nas the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court\nof New Jersey.

In April 2020, the two federal\ncases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative\nLitigation . In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson\nmoved to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s\nmotion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a\ndemand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same\ndefendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the\nthird case was consolidated into the consolidated action.

In July 2014, the United States notified the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case\nfiled pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the\nDistrict Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied\nthe qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case\nto the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended\ncomplaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for\nreconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s\nmotion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in\nDecember 2021.

The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson\n& Johnson and JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in\nlate 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in\nApril 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. Thereafter, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI\nobjected to any trial setting due to the LTL Bankruptcy and that any decision on whether the stay applied should be\ndeferred to the LTL Bankruptcy court. The State opposed any stay and argued that the trial court should decide\nissues concerning the stay. The motion for trial setting and JJCI’s objections were heard in November 2021 and in\nJanuary 2022, the Court granted plaintiff’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the\nCourt administrator to secure a trial date.

Restructuring\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its\nGlobal Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities,\ntechnologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive\ngrowth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering\ninitiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain\nnetwork. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 0.5billion, which is included on the\nfollowing lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 0.3billion in restructuring, $ 0.1billion in other\n(income) expense and $ 0.1billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $ 1.8billion have\nbeen recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the\nrestructuring program.\nIn total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $ 0.6billion to $\n0.8billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is\nset to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of\napproximately $ 2.1billion to $ 2.3billion, over the 4to 5year period of this activity. These costs are associated\nwith network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through\nthe fiscal year ended 2021:\n(Dollars in Millions)                     Severance    Asset Write-offs/Sales    Other(2)    Total\nReserve balance, December 29, 2019     $        164                         —          16      180\n2020 activity                                   -29                         —          -7      -36\nReserve balance, January 3, 2021                135                         —           9      144\nCurrent year activity:\nCharges                                           —                        53         420      473\nCash settlements                                -23                                  -404     -427\nSettled non cash                                  —                       -53                  -53\nReserve balance, January 2, 2022(1)    $        112                         —          25      137\n(1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next year in accordance with the\nCompany's plans and local laws.\n(2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting\nexpenses.\nThe Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due\nto the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing\nseverance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions\nwill take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become\nprobable and estimable.\n102\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of\ncomprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2,\n2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also\nhave audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2, 2022 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or\n103\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any\nway our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January\n2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate\nprograms, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,\npatient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL),\nwhich became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became\nresponsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11\nof the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order\nstaying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court\nconfirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement\nand prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate\naffiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to\ndismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss\nand on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of\namounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in\nfurtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with\nthe aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc,\nand while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL\nbankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount\naccrued.\n104\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and\nexisting talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort\nin performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this\nlitigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual\nand potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\nLitigation – Opioids\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or\nverdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined\nto be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible\nloss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a\ncomplex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions\nincluding timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various\nfactors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or\nindeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or\njurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve\ncomprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are\nnumerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local\ngovernments, including tribal governments, related to opioids matters. In October 2019, the Company announced a\nproposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the matters. In\nOctober 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that\nwould resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a\ntotal of $5 billion. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and\nsubdivision claims have been finalized, depending upon the level of participation by the various parties. The terms\nprovide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the\nsubdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The\nCompany retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is\ninsufficient participation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is\na critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining whether a reasonable estimate\nof the range of loss for the agreement to settle the opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment\nof the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether\na loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known\nactual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n105\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of January 2, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January\n2, 2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022 has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which\nappears herein.\n/s/  J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive\nOfficer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this\nevaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by\nthis Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated\nherein by reference to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, and the attestation\nregarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the “Report of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm” included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not\nexperienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its\nemployees have worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate\nand refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment."

                "content": "BUSINESS\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech (previously referred to as\nMedical Devices). Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and\ninternational operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations\nof those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents\nof the country where located.\nSegments of Business\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. Additional\ninformation required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of\nsegments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition” of this Report; and Note 17 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nConsumer Health\nThe Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the Skin\nHealth/Beauty, Over-the-Counter medicines, Baby Care, Oral Care, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed\nfrom other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedTech\nThe MedTech (previously referred to as Medical Devices) segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the\nInterventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery and Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include\nElectrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that\ntreats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke and the Heart Recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to\ntreat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock. The Orthopaedics portfolio\n(DePuy Synthes) comprises products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery\nportfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics\n(Mentor), and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand\ncontact lenses and ophthalmic technologies related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are\ndistributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by\nphysicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– MedTech.” However, the principal markets, products and\nmethods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in\ninternational business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other\nintellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 10.2% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\n2\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring\nEuropean composition of matter patent expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab\nand hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 8.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2022.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.\nThe two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent\nexpires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier\nin the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally\nfor advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\nCompany’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital\nexpenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a\ncorresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets\noutside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and\nemerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Five U.S.\nStates (California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia) now have comprehensive privacy laws in place and\nChina introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations in 2022. With other\njurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on\nthe collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has\nbeen required or directed to.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\nmedical\n3\ndevices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize\nadulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to\ngrant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports,\nand/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of\nsubstantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our\nofficers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain\nconduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively\nmarketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result\nin a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in\ndifferent countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare\ngenerally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships\nbetween healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require\ndisclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with\ndisclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international\nbusiness practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to\npayments to any foreign government official. Payers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become a more potent\nforce in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug pricing and appropriate drug and medical\ndevice utilization.\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\nInflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish\nprices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in\n2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. It is not yet certain which products the federal\ngovernment will select and subject to government-established prices, or how the federal government will establish\nprices for selected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. One or more of our\nproducts could be selected and subject to the government-established price.\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of\ninflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs.\nSeparate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The impact of the IRA on our business and\nthe broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as the federal government has yet to make various IRA\nimplementation decisions.\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies,\nand other bodies at the federal and state levels.\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that\nwould affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both\npositive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various\nprovisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions\nfor our products.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied\non companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In\nthe U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant\nsettlements and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of\nbiometric data.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting\nfrom the\n4\nCOVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's\nproducts. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, the number of employees were approximately:\n2022       2021\nEmployees1                               155,800    144,300\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    152,700    141,700\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded. Abiomed headcount has been included in the above table.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients,\nconsumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must\nadhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the\nCompany policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee\nbehaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global surveys that offer its employees the\nability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify\nopportunities to improve. In 2022, 92% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Credo Survey\nwhich was offered in 36 languages .\n5\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and\nretain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and\nbe provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs\nand educational resources\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2022, 46.2% of employees in Manager and above\njob categories who had movements (including upward promotions or lateral transfers) took advantage of career\nopportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (excluding employees in the research\nand development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 9%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson introduced the Company’s evolved enterprise Diversity, Equity and\nInclusion strategy, which recognizes how DEI accelerates the Company’s ability to meet the changing needs of the\ncommunities the Company serves to deliver Our Purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nThe Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company’s DEI Mission is: Make diversity, equity\nand inclusion how we work everyday . Our evolved enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to our DEI Vision and Mission\nand rests on four core pillars:\nAccelerate our global culture of inclusion where every individual belongs\nBuild a workforce that reflects the diversity of our communities\nTransform talent and business processes to achieve equitable access and outcomes for all\nDrive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world\nThe Company’s DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\neverywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being,\nincluding annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare\nbenefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition\nof the Company’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities, the Company\nextended its paid parental leave benefit globally from 8 to 12 weeks for all eligible employees. In the U.S., the\nbenefit was effective on January 1, 2022, with retroactive coverage for new family additions as of July 1, 2021.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees.

                "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and\ntechnologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\nretailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name\nconsumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such\ndelays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact\nas well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party\nmanufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the\n8\nCompany would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays\nand increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises), including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants\n(COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer\ndemand and usage of certain of our products. The continued spread of COVID-19 or other health crises may cause the\nCompany to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or\nas the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners.\nWhile the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help\nmitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely\naffected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have substantially reopened their economies, the extent to which COVID-19, or\nother health crises, could impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be\npredicted with confidence, including the duration of an outbreak and impact of variants. A surge in COVID-19 or\nother health crises could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented\nin order to control the spread of disease. The global spread of COVID-19 or other health crises could adversely\nimpact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-\nparty suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect\nthe Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our vaccine development programs, including uncertainties related to the risk\nthat our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from\nregulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its\nefficacy, safety and durability; the risk that continued evolution and mutation of disease and the duration of a\nparticular outbreak may impede our ability to conduct trials within a specified time frame; the risk that data are\nsubject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the\nscientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory\nauthorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers, external manufacturers, and\nother third parties with whom we engage; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive\nproducts; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the\navailability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs\nassociated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or\nprovide additional research funding for potential drug development; the risk that we may not be able to create or\nscale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a\nmanufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for\nany potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the\nestimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and\nrisks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such\nproducts, including in the U.S.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms\nand increasing pricing pressures.\n9\nSales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-\nparty payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As\npart of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which\nproducts will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\nscrutiny or pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially\nimpose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to\npenalties. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have\npervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price\ncontrols, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual\nproperty protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a\nwholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\nsignificant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\nlegal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates.\nRegulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality\nregulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and\npenalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and\nlitigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation,\ninvestigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate\nProgram, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws.\nScrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S.,\nand any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties\nincluding, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant\ncurrent investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal\nProceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent adoption by the EU, enactment by South Korea and the\nanticipated enactment\n10\nby additional countries of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and\nresults of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would\nresult in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular\njurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit\nrecorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they\narise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related\nexpense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report\nfor additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and\nindications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years\n11\naccounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to\ndevelop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates\nwill be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally .\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in\nArgentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed\n100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs,\nproductivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of\ncontinued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation\nrates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws\n12\nand regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and\nanticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal\nsanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\nrequirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing\ncosts and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nThe Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provoked\nstrong reactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and various other countries and\neconomic and political organizations around the world. We have been monitoring the geopolitical situation in Russia\nsince the start of the Russia-Ukraine War and have suspended additional investment, enrollment of clinical trials,\nand supply of our personal care products in Russia. We continue to monitor the need for humanitarian relief in the\nregion and continue to supply our medicines, medical devices and equipment in the region in compliance with the\napplicable sanctions. We will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and to evaluate our\nactivities and future operations in Russia.\nActions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War include the imposition of export controls and broad financial\nand economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine. Additional sanctions or other\nmeasures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file,\nprosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Russian\ngovernment has already taken action allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by\npatent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be\nable to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and\ninto Russia.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, other risks related to the broad economic consequences\nof the Russia-Ukraine War, including foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in countries\naffected by the Russia-Ukraine War and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of\nmaterials and other inputs for our products and suppliers operating in Russia and Ukraine. We also continue to\nmonitor the various sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine War.\nThe full impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the ongoing conflict, on the global\neconomy and geopolitical relations, in general, and on our business in particular, remain uncertain. Any or all of\nthe foregoing risks could\n13\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, particularly as the conflict\ncontinues for an indefinite period of time. Given that developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine War are ongoing\nand have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise that are not presently known to us. The\nRussia-Ukraine War may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors”\nsection.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\nThe planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline\ncurrently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a standalone publicly traded company, which was subsequently named Kenvue, Inc. (\"Kenvue\"). The\nplanned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The\nCompany is targeting completion of the planned separation in 2023. Completion of the planned separation will be\nsubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and\nother employee representative bodies, as required, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, the\ncontinuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free nature of\nthe transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate\ntiming of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay,\nprevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general\nor financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or\nclearances.\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsome or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the\nCompany’s Consumer Health business.\nThe Company has incurred, and is expected to incur, significant expenses in connection with the planned separation.\nIn addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to\nresult from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of\nassumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock,\nand the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of\nshares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock\nmay be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation\nunder the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among other\nthings, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the IRS and receipt\nof favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be based on,\namong other things, various facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and Kenvue\nregarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these\nfacts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its\nshareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors. Notwithstanding the private\nletter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to the planned separation the IRS determines that certain\nsteps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting\ntax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify\nfor tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability\nto the Company.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of\n14\nknowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nor results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and\ncybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these\nsystems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The\nCompany continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and\nresponse capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and\ncontrols, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or\noperations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other\nbusiness harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in\nthe event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all\nfinancial, legal, business or reputational losses.\nAs a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, there has been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk\nof information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its\ndirection. Although we have taken steps to enhance our protections against these attacks, we may not be able to\naddress the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly,\nor at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, we\nare aware of incidents in which our third-party partners have been the target of information security or\ncybersecurity incidents as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War. Although, to date, our IT Systems have not been\ncompromised by these incidents, it is possible that future information security or cybersecurity incidents\ninvolving our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could successfully compromise our\nIT Systems, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance\nobligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such\nrequirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy\nenforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international\ndata flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are\nrequired to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company\nand involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border\ndata flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact\nour business operations and research activities.\n15"

The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer\nHealth segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-\nCounter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public\nand sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment\nis focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions\n(cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and\nretailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals\nand clinics.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech business segments.\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the\nworld. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies\ninvolved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and\nprocesses, is particularly significant.

Operational growth was\nprimarily attributable to increased Cough/Cold/Flu, adult and pediatric incidences, price actions primarily in the\nU.S. and increased consumption in China due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Growth was partially offset by\nsupply constraints.\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.4 billion declined 4.2% as compared to the prior year. The operational\ndecline was driven by supply constraints in the U.S. partially offset by price actions and strong new product\nperformance in the Asia Pacific and Latin America region.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 8.5% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline\nwas due to portfolio simplification in the U.S., competitive pressures in EMEA and China, category decline and\npricing pressures in EMEA, as well as suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative COVID-19 impacts in\nChina.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 6.7% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline\nwas driven by category deceleration and competitive pressures in the U.S., suspension of personal care sales in\nRussia and weakness in India.\nThe Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion declined 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Operational growth\ndriven by lapping prior year supply constraints in EMEA, strength in India, and price actions in LATAM was\npartially offset by suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative currency impacts.\nThe Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion declined 5.3% as compared to the prior year. The operational\ndecline was driven by lapping strong prior year consumption, competitive pressure in the U.S., and decreased\nconsumption in China.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as\nthe name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company\nby the end of the fiscal year 2023.\n23\nPharmaceutical Segment\nPharmaceutical segment sales in 2022 were $52.6 billion, an increase of 1.7% from 2021, which included operational\ngrowth of 6.7% and a negative currency impact of 5.0%. U.S. sales were $28.6 billion, an increase of 2.3%.\nInternational sales were $24.0 billion, an increase of 1.0%, which included 11.9% operational growth and a negative\ncurrency impact of 10.9%. In 2022, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.1% on the\noperational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment.

Operational growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and\nUlcerative Colitis and strength of TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was\npartially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA\n(ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2022 were approximately $6.4 billion and the expiration of this product patent\nor loss of market exclusivity will result in a reduction in sales.\nInfectious disease products sales were $5.4 billion in 2022, representing a decline of 6.5% as compared to the\nprior year. Operational growth was driven by the COVID-19 vaccine outside the U.S partially offset by lower sales\nof PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of\nPREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products sales were $6.9 billion, in 2022, representing a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior\nyear. The operational sales growth of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA\nfrom new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA was offset by negative currency\nimpacts and lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA.\nOncology products achieved sales of $16.0 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 9.9% as compared to the\nprior year. Contributions to operational growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains\nin all regions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation as well as the continued\nglobal launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). This was partially offset by declining sales of IMBRUVICA\n(ibrutinib) due to competitive pressures and market suppression and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity in the\nEuropean Union in the second half of 2022.\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.4 billion, a decline of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. The\noperational sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) due to continued share gains and market\ngrowth was offset by COVID-19 related impacts and continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.9 billion, a decline of 5.6% as compared to the prior year.\nThe operational decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) due to\nshare erosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition.\nThe Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. The policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy update\nhad discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2022.\n25\nDuring 2022, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and\nadditional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nProduct Name                Indication                   US  Approval    EU  Approval    US Filing    EU Filing\n(Chemical Name)\naprocitentan                Treatment for difficult\nto treat hypertension\nCABENUVA (rilpivirine       HIV treatment for\nand cabotegravir)           adolescents\nTreatment for patients\nCARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene    with relapsed or\nautoleucel)                 refractory Multiple\nMyeloma\nERLEADA                     Tablet reduction\n(apalutamide)\nTreatment for Pediatric\nIMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib)      Patients with Chronic\nGraft-Versus-Host Disease\nTreatment for Frontline\nChronic Lymphocytic\nLeukemia (I + V fixed\nduration) (GLOW)\nTreatment of L1 Prostate\ncancer metastatic\nniraparib                   castration-resistant in\ncombination with\nabiraterone acetate and\nPrednisone\nTreatment of Pediatric\nSTELARA (ustekinumab)       Patients with Juvenile\nPsoriatic Arthritis\nTreatment of Patients\nTalquetamab                 with Relapsed Refractory\nMultiple Myeloma\nteclistamab                 Treatment of Patients\n(BCMA/CD3)                  with Relapsed Refractory\nMultiple Myeloma\n26\nMedTech Segment**\nThe MedTech segment sales in 2022 were $27.4 billion, an increase of 1.4% from 2021, which included operational\ngrowth of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%.

The operational\ngrowth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the following: Endocutter market recovery and new products\npartially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.; Biosurgery market recovery and the success of new products\npartially offset by strong U.S. market demand in the prior year for infection prevention products; and Energy\nproducts driven by market recovery and new product penetration coupled with competitive supply challenges. The\noperational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and technology penetration.\nThe Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.6 billion in 2022, which was flat to the prior year. The Orthopaedics\nfranchise included operational sales growth of 3.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%. The operational\ngrowth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS\nstem and enabling technologies – KINCISE and VELYS Hip Navigation. This growth was partially offset by impacts of\nvolume-based procurement in China and the timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in knees was\nprimarily driven by procedure recovery, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS\nRobotic assisted solution. This growth was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and\ntiming of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in Trauma was driven by global market recovery and uptake\nof new products. The operational growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new\nproduct introductions. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Spine and impacts of volume-\nbased procurement in China.\nThe Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.8 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 3.4% from 2021. The\nContact Lenses/Other operational growth was due to market recovery, price actions, commercial execution and\nbenefits from new products. Surgical Vision operational growth was primarily due to market recovery and the success\nof new products and was partially offset by a higher prior year U.S. Refractory market.\nThe Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $4.3 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 8.3%\nfrom 2021.

The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high\nquality and innovative products.\nResearch and Development decreased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:\nLower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical business\nIn-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset\nimpairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab\n(JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa\n(HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS indication became available which led\nthe Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all\nrights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a\npartial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery\ndigital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was\ncalculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human\nprocedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The\nCompany will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program\nactivities are ongoing.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses\nrelated to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation\n- JJDC, Inc.

These arrangements provided the Company with\nsupplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if\ncapacity is not required. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply\narrangements. In fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 Vaccine related costs (mentioned above) included the remaining\ncommitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit and related inventory costs and required\nclinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's modification of its\n30\nCOVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual\nrequirements.\nMedTech Segment:\nIn 2022, the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.8% versus 16.2% in 2021. The increase\nin the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\nAn IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava)\nacquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019\npartially offset by:\nHigher litigation related expense of $0.6 billion in 2022, primarily related to pelvic mesh costs versus $0.1\nbillion in 2021\nAcquisition related costs of $0.3 billion in 2022 related to the Abiomed acquisition versus $0.1 billion in 2021\nRestructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its\nGlobal Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical\ncapabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future,\nenhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions included expanding its use of strategic\ncollaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing\ncapabilities and optimizing its supply chain network. The Company has achieved approximately $0.8 billion in annual\npre-tax cost savings as outlined in the restructuring actions. In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of\n$0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in\nrestructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project\ncosts of approximately $2.2 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was\ncompleted in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 17.4% in 2022 and 8.3% in 2021.\nIn the fiscal 2022, the Company incurred approximately $0.5 billion net incremental international tax cost related\nto the legal separation of the Consumer Health business, and may continue to incur additional cost in fiscal 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU\neffective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive.\nA significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation, including South Korea\nwhich approved legislation on December 23, 2022 with a full effective date of January 1, 2024. The Company is\ncontinuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative\nadoption by additional individual countries, including those within the European Union.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2022 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.1 billion at the end of 2022 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2021.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.4 billion decrease were:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$                   14.5    Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n21.2    cash generated from operating activities\n-12.4    net cash used by investing activities\n-8.9    net cash used by financing activities\n$                   -0.3    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$                   14.1    Q4 2022 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $9.4 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2022 and $17.1 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2021.

As of January 1, 2023, the net debt position was $16.1 billion as compared to the prior year\nof $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. in December 2022. The debt\nbalance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion in 2021. Considering recent market\nconditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any\nsignificant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from\nexternal sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper\nmarkets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining\nbalance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.7 billion and the\nestablishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing\nbasis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal\n2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (TCJA) requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research\nand development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a\nresult, in fiscal 2022, the Company experienced an increase in annual cash tax payments of approximately $1.2\nbillion above what otherwise would have been remitted to the U.S Treasury. The Company concurrently records a\ndeferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes. The\nrequirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is\nnot affected by this provision.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program,\nauthorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share repurchases may be made\nat management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The\nrepurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares\nacquired will be available\n32\nfor general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash.\nThrough January 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion has been repurchased under the program.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nJanuary 1, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nTax Legislation                             Interest on\n(Dollars in Millions)                (TCJA)    Debt Obligations    Debt Obligations     Total\n2023                     $            1,522               1,551                 893     3,966\n2024                                  2,029               1,392                 843     4,264\n2025                                  2,536               1,667                 789     4,992\n2026                                      —               1,996                 744     2,740\n2027                                      —               2,271                 736     3,007\nAfter 2026                                —              19,562               8,772    28,334\nTotal                    $            6,087              28,439              12,777    47,303\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1,\n2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either\nscenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.7 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.1 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023. In November 2022, the\nCompany secured an additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which has an expiration of November\n21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment\nfees under the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $39.7 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. The increase in\nborrowings was due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. In 2022, net debt (cash and current marketable securities,\nnet of debt) was $16.1 billion compared to net debt of $2.1 billion in 2021. Total debt represented 34.1% of total\ncapital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2022 and 31.3% of total capital in 2021. Shareholders’ equity per\nshare at the end of 2022 was $29.39 compared to $28.16 at year-end 2021.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n33\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2022 for the 60th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.45 per share\nin 2022 and $4.19 per share in 2021.\nOn January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on March 7,\n2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the\nfiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than\n2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and\n2020 and are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n34\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and January

If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\n36\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for\nthe two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on\nthe date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends,\nwhich are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2023.\n37\nEconomic and Market Factors\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2012 - 2022, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate\nsurpassed 100%. Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted for operations in Turkey as\nhighly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material\nimpact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its\nprofit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not\nmaterial. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s\nUkraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the\nfiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries\nrepresented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.\nIn early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply\nof personal care products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of\nthe products for healthcare purposes.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2022 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.1\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based\n38\non new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and\nregulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies\noften result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on\nestimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments\ncan be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are\nunsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings\nare in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or\njurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve\ncomprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are\nnumerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the\nCompany, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2023,\nthere were 124,211 record holders of Common Stock of the Company."

Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 152,700employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into threebusiness segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer\nHealth segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-\nCounter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public\nand sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment\nis focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions\n(cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and\nretailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals\nand clinics.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as\nthe name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company\nby the end of the fiscal year 2023.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 1, 2023\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\nObligations\nThis update requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose additional information about the program\nto allow financial statement users to better understand the effect of the programs on an entity’s working capital,\nliquidity, and cash flows. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its\ndisclosures and will adopt this standard in the fiscal first quarter of 2023.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and\n46\nlosses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available\nfor current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management\ndetermines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase\nand re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment\nand adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nBuilding and building equipment    30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates,\nReturns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 9.6billion and $ 7.7billion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each\nof the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than\n2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and\n2020 and are included in sales to customers.\n47\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1billion, $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived\nintangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written off or partially\nimpaired depending on the underlying program.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.1billion and $ 0.9billion in fiscal years 2022 and\n2021, respectively. The lease liability was $ 1.3billion and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The operating lease costs were $ 0.3billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash\npaid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company\n48\naccrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does\nnot record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n*    Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful\nlife.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 2.1billion, $ 2.7billion and $ 2.1billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously\n49\nundistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of\ncash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This\ntax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through\n2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2022 was approximately $ 6.1billion, of which $ 4.6billion is\nclassified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of\nthis account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n50\n2.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related\nto fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency\ninterest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the\nCompany uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and\nliabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the\nfair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the\nrelated foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional\namounts totaling $ 2.4billion in contemplation of hedging interest rate risk associated with long-term financing\nfor the Consumer Health segment separation. These forward starting interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges\nand therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings. At the end of the fiscal\nyear 2022, the changes in fair value was not material and therefore not included in the table below.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of January 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted\nto $ 0.8billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors\ncounter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company\nprimarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\nRefer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 43.3billion, $ 36.2billion and $ 12.4billion, respectively. As of January 2, 2022, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 45.8billion, $ 37.4billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 230million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings\nmay differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange\nrates at maturity of the derivative.\n54\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, net of tax:\nJanua…                                             Janua…\n1,                                                 2,\n2023                                               2022\n(Dol…                   Cost              Inter…      Other              Cost of              Intere…     Other\nin           Sales        of       R&D    (Inco…    (Incom…     Sales    Produc…       R&D    (Incom…    (Inco…\nMill…                 Produ…    Expen…    Expen…    Expense                 Sold    Expen…    Expense    Expen…\nSold\nThe\neffe…\nof\nfair\nvalu…\nnet\ninve…\nand\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nfair\nvalue\nhedg…\nrela…\nInte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nHedg…    $       —         —         —    -1,098          —         —          —         —       -109         —\nitems\nDeri…\ndesi…\nas               —         —         —     1,098          —         —          —         —        109         —\nhedg…\ninst…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nnet\ninve…\nhedg…\nrela…\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…\nreco…\nin\ninco…    $       —         —         —       140          —         —          —         —        174         —\non\nderi…\namou…\nexcl…\nfrom\neffe…\ntest…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               —         —         —       140          —         —          —         —        174         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nGain\n(Los…\non\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nrela…\nForw…\nfore…\nexch…\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…          -72      -271       149         —        -23        17        119        30          —        47\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               5       319        61         —       -113       -94       -557       123          —       146\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…            —         —         —       425          —         —          —         —        402         —\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor       $       —         —         —        42          —         —          —         —          9         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nAs of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges\nLine item\nin the                                                             Cumulative\nConsolid…                                                           Amount of\nBalance                                                            Fair Value\nSheet in                                                              Hedging\nwhich the                                                          Adjustment\nhedged                                                               Included\nitem is          Carrying                                              in the\nincluded        Amount of                                            Carrying\n(Dollars              the                                           Amount of\nin                 Hedged  January 1,              January         the Hedged  January               January 2,\nMillions)       Liability  2023                    2, 2022          Liability  1, 2023               2022\nLong-term    $      8,665                $  9,793               $      -1,435               $  -142\nDebt\n55\nGain/(Loss)\n(Dollars in Millions)             Location of Gain /(Loss)                     Recognized In\nDerivatives Not Designated as     Recognized in Income                  Income on Derivative\nHedging Instruments               on Derivative                              January 1, 2023    January 2, 2022\nForeign Exchange Contracts        Other (income) expense             $                    94                -70\nLocation of\nGain or (Loss)\nReclassified\nfrom               Gain/(Loss)\nAccumulated        Reclassified\nGain/(Loss)                       Other              From\nRecognized In                       Comprehensive      Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in          Accumulated OCI                       Income Into        Into Income        January 2,\nMillions)            January 1, 2023    January 2, 2022    Income             January 1, 2023    2022\nInterest\nDebt              $              197                387    (income)           —                  —\nexpense\nCross Currency                                             Interest\ninterest rate     $              766                548    (income)           —                  —\nswaps                                                      expense\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values.

There were offsetting impacts of $ 142million and $ 422million, respectively, of changes\nin the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of\ninvestments. The impact in fiscal year 2021, was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment. In fiscal\nyear 2022, the Company sold all of its equity investments in argenx SE for proceeds of $ 0.6billion.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n57\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 were as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:          2022                                        2021\nAssets:                                              Level 1    Level 2    Level 3     Total    Total(1)\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —        629          —       629         540\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —      1,534          —     1,534         796\nTotal                                             $        —      2,163          —     2,163       1,336\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —        511          —       511         881\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —      2,778          —     2,778         979\nTotal                                             $        —      3,289          —     3,289       1,860\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —         38          —        38          24\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —         68          —        68          28\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(3)                                    576          —          —       576       1,884\nDebt securities(4)                                         —     10,487          —    10,487      19,727\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(5)                                $                 1,120     1,120         533\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\n(Dollars in Millions)                          2022      2021\nTotal Gross Assets                        $   2,201     1,360\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -2,176    -1,285\nTotal Net Asset                                  25        75\nTotal Gross Liabilities                       3,357     1,888\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -3,023    -1,855\nTotal Net Liabilities                     $     334        33\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                     2022    2021      2020\nBeginning Balance                     $    533     633     1,715\nChanges in estimated fair value(6)        -194     -52    -1,089\nAdditions(7)                               792       —       106\nPayments                                   -11     -48       -99\nEnding Balance                        $  1,120     533       633\n(1) 2021 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,884million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 533million, classified as Level 3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n58\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 1,116million, $ 520million and $ 594million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of\nJanuary 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively.

The 2022 amount includes the impact of certain provisions of the 2017 TCJA\nthat became effective in fiscal 2022. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries;\nthe 2020 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further\ndescribed below.\n(3) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nThe fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 9.1% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate. As\npart of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company has recognized approximately\n$ 0.5billion in net incremental tax costs in fiscal year 2022, which increased the 2022 effective tax rate by\napproximately 2.2%.\nAdditionally, the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in\nan unfavorable impact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These\nitems are described below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022, the impairment of bermekimab for AD and HS IPR&D (for\nfurther information see Note 5 of the 2022 10-K Consolidated Financial Statements) and changes in the fair value of\nsecurities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate.\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain\nwholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of\ncertain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring\nwas approximately $ 0.6billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these\nassets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international\nincome” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally\nother fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\n62\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an effective tax rate of\n23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the\nAuris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%.\nIn fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) and became\neffective for fiscal year 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain\nconditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and\namortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research\nand development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1)\ntax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not\nto exceed 5 years. The Company has operations located in various Swiss cantons.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\nremaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\nadditional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss\nTax Reform of approximately $ 0.4billion or 2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this\nbenefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 450million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition,\nin the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\nbefore taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0billion associated with a revised agreement\nin principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition in 2019 and\nreversed some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in\ncertain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\n63\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n2022 Deferred Tax                       2021 Deferred Tax(1)\n(Dollars in Millions)                       Asset    Liability                         Asset    Liability\nEmployee related             $                725                                      1,244\nobligations\nStock based compensation                      687                                        679\nDepreciation of property,\nplant and                                                 -858                                       -876\nequipment\nGoodwill and intangibles                                -4,271    -3                               -2,659    -2\nR&D capitalized for tax                     2,611                                      1,664\nReserves & liabilities                      2,761                                      2,882\nIncome reported for tax                     2,045                                      2,566\npurposes\nNet realizable operating\nloss                                        1,260                                      1,720\ncarryforwards(4)\nUndistributed foreign                       1,565       -1,693                         1,015       -1,461\nearnings\nGlobal intangible                                       -3,547                                     -4,853\nlow-taxed income\nMiscellaneous                               1,053          -65                           870          -39\ninternational\nMiscellaneous U.S.                            476                                                     -16\nTotal deferred income        $             13,183      -10,434                        12,640       -9,904\ntaxes\n(1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n(2) Amount is inclusive of the $ 2.3billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership\nstructure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described.\n(3) Amount is inclusive of the $ 1.8billion deferred tax liability due to the acquisition of Abiomed.\n(4) Net of valuation allowances of $ 0.9billion in both 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax\naudits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year\n2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $ 0.7billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final\nsettlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back\nto the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve\nmonths by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States. However, the Company is not\nable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in\nuncertain tax positions, if any.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax\nexpense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 139million, $ 44million and $ 32million in fiscal\nyears 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 651million and $ 512million in\nfiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n64\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\n(Dollars in Millions)                 2022     2021\nPension benefits                  $  2,698    4,088\nPostretirement benefits              1,734    2,069\nPostemployment benefits              2,832    3,117\nDeferred compensation                  100      181\nTotal employee obligations           7,364    9,455\nLess current benefits payable          597      557\nEmployee related obligations —    $  6,767    8,898\nnon-current\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $ 4,581million and $ 4,436million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, are\nincluded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2022 and 2021 the Company used December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nRetirement Plans                        Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions)                           2022      2021      2020                   2022    2021    2020\nService cost                     $             1,327     1,421     1,380                    320     309     287\nInterest cost                                    911       770       955                    105      81     133\nExpected return on plan                       -2,757    -2,645    -2,461                     -8      -7      -7\nassets\nAmortization of prior service                   -184      -181         2                     -5     -31     -31\ncost\nRecognized actuarial losses                      655     1,257       891                    121     151     142\n(gains)\nCurtailments and settlements                       1         1        23                      —       —       —\nNet periodic benefit cost        $               -47       623       790                    533     503     524\n(credit)\n65\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net\nperiodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings.\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\nRetirement Plans                       Other Benefit Plans\nWorldwide Benefit Plans                          2022       2021    2020                   2022    2021    2020\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nService cost discount rate                       2.46  %    2.14    2.82                   2.59    2.09    3.04\nInterest cost discount rate                      2.80  %    2.34    3.13                   2.64    2.33    3.08\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.02  %    4.01    4.00                   4.21    4.25    4.25\nlevels\nExpected long-term rate of return\non                                               7.25  %    7.71    8.12\nplan assets\nBenefit Obligation\nDiscount rate                                    5.01  %    2.49    2.14                   5.42    2.68    2.23\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.00  %    4.01    4.00                   4.21    4.21    4.27\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.\nThe Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that\nyield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.\nThe expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on\ndiversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial\nsources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets\nin the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\n69\nOther assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are\nvalued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded\nare classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021:\nQuoted\nPrices\nin\nActive\nMarkets              Signif…\nfor                Other              Signif…            Invest…\nIdenti…              Observ…              Unobse…            Measur…\nAssets               Inputs              Inputs…             at Net\n(Doll…        (Level               (Level               (Level              Asset               Total\nin                1)                   2)                   3)              Value              Assets\nMilli…          2022      2021       2022      2021       2022    2021       2022      2021      2022      2021\nShort…\ninves…    $       33       102         13     1,033          —       —          —         —        46     1,135\nfunds\nGover…\nand                —         —      5,863     7,016          —       —          —         —     5,863     7,016\nagency\nsecur…\nDebt               —         —      3,681     3,505          —       —          —         —     3,681     3,505\ninstr…\nEquity         8,846    14,107          2         2          —       —          —         —     8,848    14,109\nsecur…\nCommi…             —         —      4,362     5,496         56     105      6,106     8,708    10,524    14,309\nfunds\nOther              —         —         33        34         13      15      2,506     1,807     2,552     1,856\nassets\nInves…\nat        $    8,879    14,209     13,954    17,086         69     120      8,612    10,515    31,514    41,930\nfair\nvalue\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 78million and $\n102million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 21million ( 0.1% of total plan\nassets) at December 31, 2022 and $ 385million ( 0.9% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021.\n11.\nSavings Plan\nThe Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering\neligible employees.

The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 1, 2023, the Company had onestock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts\nunder the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share\nunits) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of which up to 110million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis\nagainst the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are granted, each full value\naward in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for\nfuture grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 150million at the end of fiscal year 2022.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,138million, $ 1,135million and $\n1,005million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 196million, $ 218million and $ 210million for fiscal\nyears 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n282million, $ 223million and $ 248million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 939million, $\n862million and $ 804million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average period for\nthis cost to be recognized was 1.80years, 1.78years and 1.76years for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\n72\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2022, 2021, and 2020 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n2022          2021          2020\nRisk-free rate               1.98    %     0.83    %     1.47    %\nExpected volatility         18.00    %    18.59    %    15.33    %\nExpected life (in years)           7.0           7.0           7.0\nExpected dividend yield      2.70    %     2.50    %     2.60    %\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nWeighted                       Value\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Shares       Average Exercise Price       (Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 29, 2019               111,637    $                  105.63    $                  4,478\nOptions granted                            20,723                       151.41\nOptions exercised                         -16,275                        86.05\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -1,835                       137.62\nShares at January 3, 2021                 114,250                       116.22                       4,703\nOptions granted                            18,525                       164.62\nOptions exercised                         -13,248                        97.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,166                       149.75\nShares at January 2, 2022                 117,361                       125.36                       5,364\nOptions granted                            19,809                       165.89\nOptions exercised                         -16,310                       100.15\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,188                       160.56\nShares at January 1, 2023                 118,672    $                  134.95    $                  4,949\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 1,228million, $ 919million and $ 1,021million in fiscal years\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n73\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 1, 2023:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                 Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise           Options    Average              Average                     Options    Average\nPrice Range                   Life(1)              Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$72.54-$10…         17,221                  1.5                  $93.07         17,221                   $93.07\n$101.87-$1…         22,039                  3.6                 $108.78         22,039                  $108.78\n$129.51-$1…         24,870                  5.7                 $130.88         24,228                  $130.85\n$151.41-$1…         35,465                  7.6                 $157.75            150                  $156.21\n$164.63-$1…         19,077                  9.1                 $165.89             23                  $165.89\n118,672                  5.8                 $134.95         63,661                  $113.06\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 were 117,361and an average life of 5.8years and\n114,250and an average life of 6.0years, respectively.

These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results\nof operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 17.3billion\nand has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not\nmaterial.\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\nthe Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\nrecovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and the results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the\nacquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash\nacquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $\n35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if\ncertain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into\naccount the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nacquired.\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\na. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson & Johnson’s\nfiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this\nperiod and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;\nb. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella ® products in ST-elevated\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\nc. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella ®\nproducts in high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective\nclinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\nThe fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 19.9billion (net of $ 0.3billion cash\nacquired), primarily to goodwill for $ 10.9billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6billion, IPR&D for $\n1.1billion, marketable\n82\nsecurities of $ 0.6billion and liabilities assumed of $ 2.8billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent\nconsideration mentioned above for $ 0.7billion and deferred taxes of $ 1.8billion. The goodwill is primarily\nattributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for\ntax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs the acquisition occurred in December 2022, the Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price\nto the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price included in the\ncurrent period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change.\nTo assist management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals. The\nCompany will finalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The\nCompany expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella ® platform\nwith an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved\nproducts. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the\nrisk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied\nwas 9.5%.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.3billion, which was\nrecorded in Other (income)/expense.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $ 7.3billion in cash and $ 0.4billion of liabilities\nassumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations\nhave been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5billion and\nhas been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which\nhas multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases\nand the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science\ncapabilities.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational\ncompound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech\nInc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8billion applying a probability of success factor that\nranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different\nindications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset\nimpairment charge of approximately $ 0.8billion related to this in-process research and development asset.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares\nin Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares\npreviously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the MedTech\nsegment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily\nIPR&D, for $ 0.4billion, goodwill for $ 0.2billion, other assets of $ 0.2billion and liabilities assumed of $\n0.3billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $\n0.4billion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $\n6.1billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable\nintangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0billion, goodwill of $ 1.2billion, other assets of $ 0.5billion and liabilities\nof $ 1.6billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal\ndisorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the\nasset, probability of success factors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect\ninherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The\ngoodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected\nto be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the\nPharmaceutical segment.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nDivestitures\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\nPharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\n83\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the\ncompany at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337million ($ 357million)\nbased on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the\nCompany had rights to approximately 38.7million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF\n445million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110million ($ 120million) of this\nloan into approximately 9.6million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as\nestimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent\nprojected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and\nwith different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information\nbecomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing\nSystem; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON'S Baby Powder; ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; ELMIRON; and TYLENOL. As of January 1, 2023, in\nthe United States there were approximately 170plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries\nallegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400with respect to the\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,000with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,100with respect to RISPERDAL; 40,300with\nrespect to body powders containing talc; 2,100with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; 2,000with\nrespect to ELMIRON; and 170 with respect to TYLENOL. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as\ncertain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.\n84\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Prior to 2019, several adverse verdicts had been\nrendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of\n2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement\nprogram, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability\nlitigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nBelgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South\nAfrica. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to\nliability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and\npost-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress\nurinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company\nreached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court\napproval. In November 2022, the application for approval of the settlement was filed, and a hearing on the\nsettlement has been scheduled for the end of February 2023. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020\nas a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in\nMay 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to\napprove the settlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product\nliability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District\n85\nof Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits\npending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits\npending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term\nsheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL\nand MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes\n3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending\nthe completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 2,236have been dismissed with\nprejudice. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early\nexpert reports and discovery requirements. As of January 2023, there are approximately 208active cases subject to\nthese orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending resolution of the proposed\nsettlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring\nearly expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\nPHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully\ndefended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October\n2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in\nJanuary 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing\nplaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs\nassociated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); the Company; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG, and\ncertain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-\ndistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases\nwere filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort\nlitigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action\nlawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and the Company announced an agreement in principle to\nsettle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement\nbecame final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases\npending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States\nsettlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation.\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson\nConsumer Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby\nPowder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as\nwell as outside of the United States, continued to increase.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &\nJohnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer\nof the case to the Missouri Supreme Court\n86\nwas subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the\nUnited States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest,\ntotaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to\nthe Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to\nbelieve that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding\nthe Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled\ncases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation\nagainst LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the\nstay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-\nrelated claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified\nretailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was\ntransferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court\nextended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and,\nfollowing a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March\n2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected\nParties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the\nextension of the stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The\nbriefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit\nreversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL\nfiled a petition for rehearing on the decision.\nWhile the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court’s order effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury\nlitigation, LTL has agreed to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed.\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\ndetermines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company\nhas established a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After and as a\nresult of the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party. The\nimpact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all\ntalc matters in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amount accrued.\nA class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey\nstate court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the\nCompany fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc\nmined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor\nMinerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the\nEdley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the\nImerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company\nfiled motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey\nDistrict Court.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of\nthe United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware\n(Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from\nexposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for\nindemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort\nClaimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents)\nfiled their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related\n87\nthereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing\non the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the\nDisclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan.\nIn March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April\n2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the\nPlan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify\nthose votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn.\nIn October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, certain of\nImerys’s insurers, and certain parties in the Cyprus Mines chapter 11 case (described below) (collectively the\nMediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The most recent term of the mediation ended on December 31, 2022.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys\nAdversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with\nrespect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously\nfiled a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from\nundergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The\nBankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The\nBankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding.\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus),\nwhich had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the\nImerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus\nAdversary Proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary\ncomplaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code\nand filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with\nImerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys\nPlan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties. Cyprus\nhas not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in\nthe Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October\n2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay\narising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding. In June 2022,\nCyprus commenced an Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case seeking an order enforcing the automatic stay by\nenjoining parties from commencing or continuing “talc-related claims” against CAMC. In June 2022, the court entered\na preliminary injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-related claims against CAMC through January\n2023.\nIn February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the\nCoverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the\nautomatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic\nstay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a\nlimited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying\nthe stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the\nLTL automatic stay applied to the Coverage Action.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is\nseeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete\nas of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company\nanswered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. In\nJuly 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for class\ncertification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class\ncertification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. In March 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey Bankruptcy\nCourt to stay the securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants filed a second motion to supplement the class\ncertification record. In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the securities class\naction. Plaintiff has appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order.\n88\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In\nJuly 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved\nto dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response\nto those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\nthird amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint\nbut indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a\nFifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in\nthe Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice\nof Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its\nresponsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth\nCircuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In\nFebruary 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order extending the stay. The appeal continues to be held in\nabeyance, with the Company being required to file periodic status updates.\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to\nimprove glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada.

Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,\n89\nrequire the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any\nassociated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedTech\nIn August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc.

In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’447, and\n’906 patents and denied review of the ’276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the\n’447 and ’906 patents are not invalid.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the\napplicable patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents\nAct, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the\napplicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic\nstatutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic\ncompanies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their\nproducts to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the\napplicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In\naddition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can\ninvolve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the\nrelevant patents.\n90\nZYTIGA\nBeginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc., and BTG International Ltd.

In December 2022, the Arbitration Tribunal issued an Interim Decision\nfinding that Janssen may terminate the agreements, but it may not continue to sell products developed during the\nterm of the agreements without continuing to pay royalties to Alkermes.\nGOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS\nLike other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, the Company and certain\nof its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the\nUnited States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government\ninvestigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nThe Company and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other\npharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving\nallegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise\nactionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale\nPrice (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement\nlevels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any\nportion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid\npayments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed\nto federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately\ndismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP\ncases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial.\nIn New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho\nBiotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), the Company and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been\nresolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active\npharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries\nwere divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits\nhave also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following:\nindividual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health\ninsurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Company and JPI, have been\nfiled by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,\nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington\nand West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city,\ncounty and local government agencies in every state but Alaska. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in\nSuperior Court of San Juan.\n96\nThe Company, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information related\nto opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire,\nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, the Company and JPI were contacted by the Texas\nand Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney\nGeneral investigation.\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company\nand JPI in the amount of $ 465million. The Company and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the\nOklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants. In\nOctober 2019 the Company and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two\ncounties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California\nstate court against the Company and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nThe trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of\nDefendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied.\nPlaintiffs appealed the judgment, but later filed a request to dismiss the appeal after electing to participate in\nthe national settlement agreement.\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $\n4billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company agreed to\ncontribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed\nand future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5billion which has been\naccrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement is not an admission of\nliability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state\nand subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement was expected to be paid\nby the end of fiscal year 2022, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The\nterms provided a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for\nthe subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on expected participation, the Company committed in\nadvance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and\nNew Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states, five territories, the District of\nColumbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in the settlement, and the\nCompany confirmed that the level of participation was sufficient to proceed with the agreement as to all\nparticipants. The agreement was effective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company entered into settlement\nagreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating subdivisions. In July 2022, the\nCompany reached a settlement agreement with all litigating Oklahoma subdivisions, and in September 2022, the\nCompany settled with the State of New Hampshire and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by the end of the\nfiscal year 2022, the Company had settled the opioid claims advanced by all states except Washington.\nThere are approximately 60cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately\n570remaining federal cases against the Company and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL)\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and approximately 20additional cases pending\nagainst the Company and JPI in other federal courts. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit\nagainst the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is\nseeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the\nfederal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and\nJanssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries),\nmunicipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in\nfederal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to\nopioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud\nviolations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties\nand/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several\nliability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of\nlarge monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines,\nequitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn August 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution\nof its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into\nmanufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent\ncounsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to\nthe Board recommending that the\n97\nCompany reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of\nrelated derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s\nreport.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints\nmaking similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal\ncourts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022,\nthe state court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the\nsecond case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for\nreconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently\ndenied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order.\nOther\nIn August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson\nServices, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for\nthe production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case\nfiled pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the\nDistrict Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied\nthe qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case\nto the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a\nthird amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended\ncomplaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for\nreconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s\nmotion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in\nDecember 2021. The relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for\nreconsideration, which the District Court denied. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with\nprejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, which the District\nCourt denied except as to costs. The Relators have appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the case to the First\nCircuit. The briefing on the appeal is complete, the First Circuit held oral argument on December 6, 2022, and the\nFirst Circuit’s decision remains pending.\nIn October 2012, the Company was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state\nAttorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes\nby the Company’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints\nagainst the Company, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar\ncomplaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and\nOregon. In April 2019, the Company and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In October 2019, the Company and\nEthicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In April 2020, the\nCompany settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon.\nIn November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky matter is\nscheduled for June 2023. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. In January\n2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and\nawarded civil penalties in the amount of $ 344million. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company’s\nmotion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $ 344million,\nbut denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company appealed the penalty judgment. In\nApril 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $ 302million, but otherwise denied the appeal. In July\n2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company’s petition to review the Court of Appeals decision, and\nthe Company recorded a charge to reflect the judgment in the second quarter of 2022. In November 2022, the Company\npetitioned the United States Supreme Court for review.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District\nof Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi\nConsumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc\ncontained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive\nand monetary relief. The Company and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was\nbarred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted the Company and JJCI’s\nrequest to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and\noral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court\n98\nrejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. In August 2021, JJCI\nfiled a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s\nruling of April 2021. In December 2021 the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\nAfter the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting.\nJJCI objected to any trial setting as barred by the stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above,\nwhile the State argued that the stay did not apply. In January 2022, the Court granted the State’s motion for trial\nsetting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022,\nthe trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, given the efforts to resolve talc-\nrelated claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until\nMay 2022. The temporary stay expired in May 2022. LTL thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL\nBankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. The State filed an appeal\nto the Third Circuit concerning the stay order.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The\nCompany moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed\na motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March 2022, the New Mexico\ncourt denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and\ndenied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ\nof Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New\nMexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ\nbefore the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin\nprosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying\nthe case. In December 2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately,\nin September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing\non the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of\nits talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company.\nFive states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has\nproduced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements.\nThe Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-two states\n(including Mississippi and New Mexico) agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July\n2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL\nBankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. LTL moved the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\nfor an order staying further proceedings in those two actions, which the Bankruptcy Court granted in October 2022.\nIn December 2022, the Bankruptcy Court allowed New Mexico and Mississippi to file a direct appeal of its stay.\nIn July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False\nClaims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label\npromotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the\npromotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments\nhave declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment\non all claims in December 2021. Daubert motions were granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the\ncase is proceeding to trial.\nIn March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department\nof Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to\nrheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE or SIMPONI ARIA. In August 2019, the United\nStates Department of Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on\nthe Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company\nfiled a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway.\nIn April and September 2017, the Company received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of\nMassachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX, OLYSIO,\nREMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA and ZYTIGA. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and\nBest Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate\npayments to state Medicaid agencies. The Company has provided documents in response to the subpoenas.\n99\nIn June 2017, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of\nMassachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc.\n(DePuy) spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries\nwith physicians at these hospitals. The Company and DePuy fully cooperated with the government’s investigation. In\nJanuary 2023, the Company, DePuy Synthes, Inc., and DePuy Synthes Sales Inc. entered into a settlement agreement\nwith the United States resolving the matter for an immaterial amount.\nIn July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust\nauthority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e\nComércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-\ncompetitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The Company continues to\nrespond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and\nthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFrom time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to\nproduce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate\nwith these inquiries by producing the requested information.\nGENERAL LITIGATION\nBeginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions were filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of\nREMICADE against the Company and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen has violated\nfederal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial\npurposes as In re REMICADE Antitrust Litigation in United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania.

We also\nhave audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 2023 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Abiomed,\nInc., (“Abiomed”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, because\nit was acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Abiomed from our audit\nof internal control over financial reporting. Abiomed is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total\nsales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent\nless than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n103\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion as of January\n1, 2023. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate\nprograms, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,\npatient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL),\nwhich became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became\nresponsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11\nof the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order\nstaying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court\nconfirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement\nand prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate\naffiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was\ntransferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court\nextended the PI through the end of\n104\nFebruary 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing,\nthe New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\nsimultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants subsequently\nfiled notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May 2022,the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal were\ncompleted in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and\nremanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL has filed a petition for rehearing on the\ndecision.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and\nexisting talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort\nin performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this\nlitigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual\nand potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 16, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n105\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of January 1, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company acquired Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed), in a business combination in December 2022. Abiomed's total assets,\nexcluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related\nconsolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. As the acquisition\noccurred in the fiscal year 2022, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2022 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion\nis in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted\nfrom the scope in the year of acquisition.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January\n1, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023 has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which\nappears herein.\n/s/  J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and\nparticipated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

During the fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2023, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to\nmonitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment."

                "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Company's two business segments: Innovative Medicine (previously referred to as Pharmaceutical) and MedTech.\nWithin the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international\noperating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those\ncompanies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the\ncountry where located.\nSegments of business\nFollowing the completion of the separation of the Consumer Health business (Kenvue) in August 2023, the Company is\nnow organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional information required by this\nitem is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating\nresults under: Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of\nthis Report; and Note 17 Segments of business and geographic areas of the notes to consolidated financial\nstatements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nInnovative Medicine\nThe Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid\narthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS),\nNeuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate\ncancer, hematologic malignancies, lung cancer and bladder cancer), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis,\ndiabetes and macular degeneration) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in\nthis segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare\nprofessionals for prescription use. Key products in the Innovative Medicine segment include: REMICADE (infliximab),\na treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment\nfor adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis\nand moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for\nadults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis\nand active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA\n(ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active\npsoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to\nseverely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque\npsoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA\n(darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in\ncombination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir\nalafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) extended-\nrelease tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION\n(paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA\nTRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been\nadequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; SPRAVATO (Esketamine), a nasal spray, used along\nwith an oral antidepressant, to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and depressive symptoms in\nadults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts or actions; CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene\nautoleucel), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with\nrelapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone\n2023 Annual Report1\nacetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next- generation androgen\nreceptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), a treatment for\ncertain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a\ntreatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple\nmyeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep\nvein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement\nsurgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and\nfor the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular\nevents in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for the treatment and\nsecondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients\nfollowing the Fontan procedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term\ntreatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous,\nselective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in\ncollaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle\ndevelopment programs.\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics,\nSurgery and Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to\ntreat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe\ncoronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, and Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that\ntreats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) includes products and enabling\ntechnologies that support Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery portfolios include advanced\nand general surgery technologies (Ethicon), as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics (Mentor), and Ear,\nNose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand contact lenses and\nTECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and\nretailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nGeographic areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of\nBusiness – Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in\nthe international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business\ninclude those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key\n2\npharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal\nproceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19\nLegal proceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 12.8% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA. The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expired in 2023. As a result of\nsettlements and other agreements with third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar\nversion of STELARA before January 1, 2025 in the United States. The latest expiring European composition of matter\npatent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab\nand hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 11.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2023.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.\nThe two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound patent protection in\nselect countries extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX\nFASPRO.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier\nin the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally\nfor research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other\njurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable\nenvironmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a\nmaterial effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\n2023 Annual Report3\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various\nfederal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and\nsafety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA)\ncontinues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new\ndrugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also\nevident in major markets outside of the U.S.\nThe new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber\nsecurity laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Within the U.S., an\nincreasing number of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws and federal regulators (e.g., the U.S.\nFDA, FTC and HHS) continue to stress the intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement\npriority. In the EU, multiple directives and laws (including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act,\nand the AI Act) are rapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new\nenforcement risks. In addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security\nregulations, with more anticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer\npractices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force\ngreater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws\ncan also restrict transfers of data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are\ndeveloped and deployed globally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and\navailability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more\ncomprehensive and nuanced regulation (e.g., White House’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy\nDevelopment and Use of Artificial Intelligence; the EU AI Act) to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of\nAI is underway that includes standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require\ncompliance developments or enhancements.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has\nbeen required or directed to.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our\npharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA\ncould ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement,\nor refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require\ncertificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that\nthe products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess\ncivil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-\nwide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may\nalso recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its\nmagnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain\nfuture clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and\noperations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare\ngenerally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships\nbetween healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations\nrequire disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including\nphysicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing\ninternational business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions\nwith respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a\npotent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare\ncost and access in the U.S.\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\nInflation Reduction Act\n4\n(IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-\nspend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D\ndrugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”)\npublished the first “Selected Drug” list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as IMBRUVICA, which is\ndeveloped in collaboration and co-commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The\nSelected Drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the Medicare\npopulation. There remains uncertainty, however, regarding how the federal government will establish prices for the\nselected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. In any event, we anticipate that\nthe selected products will be subjected to a government-established price for the Medicare population.\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of\ninflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs.\nSeparate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business\nand the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical\ncompanies remains ongoing and CMS has yet to publicly announce the maximum fair price for each of the selected\ndrugs.\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies,\nand other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to\nincrease pricing transparency and controls.\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that\nwould affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both\npositive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various\nprovisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions\nfor our products.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied\non companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In\nthe U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant\nsettlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure\nof personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection\nand use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nand subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in\nthe Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\n2023 Annual Report5\nEmployees and human capital management\nAs of December 31, 2023, the number of employees was approximately:\n2023\nEmployees1                               134,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    131,900\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nEmployees by region (in percentages)\n6\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and employee engagement\nAt the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients,\nconsumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must\nadhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the\nCompany policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee\nbehaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the\nability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify\nopportunities to improve. In 2023, 94% of global employees across 76 countries participated in Our Credo Survey\nwhich was offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and development\nTo lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top\ntalent. In 2023, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 7%. The Company believes that its employees must be\nequipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their\ncareers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources are available to all employees.\nThe Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while\ncreating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this\nobjective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they\nare on their career journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's first Global\nLearning Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses across five\nareas: leadership, business skills, digital upskilling, DEI, and well-being, on J&J Learn, the Company's new\nlearning platform.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. The Company’s evidenced-based global enterprise Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy recognizes\nhow DEI accelerates the Company's ability to meet the changing needs of the communities the Company serves in, as\noutlined in Our Credo. The Company’s DEI Vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI Mission is:\nMake diversity, equity and inclusion how we work everyday . The Company's enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to the\nDEI Vision and Mission and rests on four core pillars:\nBuild a workforce of individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultures, abilities and perspectives\nFoster a culture of inclusion where every individual belongs\nTransform talent and business processes to achieve equitable opportunities for all\nDrive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback and recognizes that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.\n2023 Annual Report7\nCompensation and benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being,\nincluding annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare\nbenefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition\nof the Company’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities, the Company\nenhanced its caregiver, bereavement, and volunteer paid leave benefits, effective July 2023.\nHealth, wellness and safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company\nadvances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—ensure employee health protection for emerging\nhealth risks.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks related to our business, industry and operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development. The Company may also experience\noperational and financial risk in connection with acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks\nand liabilities associated with acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees,\nand successfully identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition-related\nstrain on our management, operations and financial resources.\nFor the Company’s Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and\ntechnologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are unable to introduce new\nproducts or technological advances that are safe, more effective, more effectively marketed or otherwise outperform\nthose of our competitors.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 61 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such\ndelays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact\nas well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a\nthird-party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component parts and\nproducts. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity\nsufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and\nto deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these\nthird-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could\nresult in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\n2023 Annual Report9\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third- party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need\nto seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased\ncosts which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises). For example, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted certain\naspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced\ncustomer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of any health crises may cause the Company to\nmodify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the\nCompany determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners under such\ncircumstances. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain\nnetwork designed to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our\nbusiness from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises could adversely impact the\nCompany’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party\nsuppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\nRisks related to government regulation and legal proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird- party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\nscrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially\nimpose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to\npenalties. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded\ninterpretations of the statute may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance. Outside the U.S.,\nnumerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in\nfunding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or\nreimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.\n10\nWe are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the countries in which\noperations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and business\noperations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive government laws and\nregulations, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other\ncountries in which it operates. For example, changes to the U.S. FDA’s timing or requirements for approval or\nclearance of our products may have a negative impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New laws and\nregulations may also impose deadlines on the Company, or its third-party suppliers, manufacturers or other partners\nand providers, for which there may be insufficient time to implement changes to comply with such new regulations\nand may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain constraints. If the Company is unable to identify ways\nto mitigate these delays or constraints, there may be an adverse effect on sales and access to our products.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a\nwholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private\nclaims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances\ncan also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product\nrecalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown\nof manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs,\nreputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nThe rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the Company and a\nfailure of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may expose the Company to\ninvestigations, legal actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing\nPractices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices\ncan lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new\nproduct approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are\nsubject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\nthe Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer\nprotection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys\ngeneral in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and\ncriminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs.\nAny such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The\nmost significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19\nLegal proceedings—Government proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n2023 Annual Report11\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent enactment by certain EU and non-EU countries, and the\nanticipated enactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s\neffective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax\nprovisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities\nrelated to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result\nin an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors\nthese proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at\nany time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the\nlaw change is enacted.\nSee Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for\nadditional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings—Intellectual property under Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n12\nRisks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation, development and implementation of new products,\ntechnologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2023 sales. The Company cannot be certain\nwhen or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies,\nwhether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products\nwill be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nThe Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging technologies\nacross varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and incorporation of AI may result in\nunintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. AI technology is continuously evolving, and\nthe AI technologies we develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these\ntechnologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive\nadvantage. The application of machine learning and AI in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws\nand regulations that may entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these\ntechnologies. These technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described\nbelow.\nRisks related to financial and economic market conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally.\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign currency exchange : In fiscal 2023, approximately 45% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 24% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 16% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in\nArgentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed\n100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs,\nproductivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of\ncontinued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in\n2023 Annual Report13\ncountries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact\nthe Company’s operating results.\nIllegal importation of pharmaceutical products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-bribery and other regulations : The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including\nthe U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement\nactivities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and\nactions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including\nexclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther financial, economic, legal, social and political risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased antitrust\nreporting requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nDue to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, including\nglobal tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world. Global\ntensions, conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or distribute our products\nmay result in foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in affected countries, and challenges\nto our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers.\nMost recently, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business\nresulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, rising conflict in the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between\nthe U.S. and China. In response to heightened conflict, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose\nexport controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and operations may be further impacted by\nthe imposition of trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country that favor domestic companies\nand technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global\ncommunity, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents,\ntrademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be\ntaken that allows companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States\nand many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from\npracticing the Company's inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia.\n14\nWeak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the financial\nmarkets could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nOther risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain and operations. The extensive information\nsecurity and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability\nof these systems and networks, including customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and\nnetworks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company\nassesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities,\nas well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this\nrisk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of\nthe attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in\nreputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.\nAlso, increasing use of AI could increase these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event\nof an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial,\nlegal, business or reputational losses.\n2023 Annual Report15\nAs a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased risk of\ninformation security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by adversaries of countries\nwhere the Company maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication of these attacks, the Company may not be\nable to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly,\nor at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these\nthreats could also impact our third-party partners resulting in compromise of the Company's IT systems, networks\nand data which could negatively affect the Company.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact on\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance\nobligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such\nrequirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy\nenforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international\ndata flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are\nrequired to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company\nand involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border\ndata flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact\nour business operations and research activities.\nThe Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits following the\nseparation of Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue), including with respect to the Company’s remaining ownership interest.\nThe Company incurred significant expenses in connection with the Kenvue separation (the Separation). In addition,\nthe Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from\nthe Separation. The anticipated benefits of the Separation were based on a number of assumptions, some of which may\nprove incorrect. The Company holds a 9.5% ownership interest in Kenvue. The Company cannot predict the trading\nprice of shares of Kenvue’s common stock and the market value of the Kenvue shares are subject to market volatility\nand other factors outside of the Company’s control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Kenvue,\nbut there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of such divestiture. Unanticipated developments could\ndelay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the divestiture, including but not limited to financial market\nconditions.\nThe Separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the Separation under the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax\nadvisors, if the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction did not qualify for tax-free treatment for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be\nsubstantial. The Separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as\na result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.\n16"

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nThe Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, and\nmonitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the Company’s information systems from\ncybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools supporting protection, detection, and response\ncapabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent\nresponse to actual or attempted cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.\nThe Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the Company's use of\nthird-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and supply chain through a\nstructured third-party risk management program.\nThe Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes training on\nmatters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory\ntraining on data privacy.\nTo evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party experts to\nundertake maturity assessments of the Company’s information security program.\nTo date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business or operations; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely impacted.

The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a member of the Company’s\nExecutive Committee, and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) are responsible for assessing and managing\ncybersecurity risks, including the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Company’s CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company’s cybersecurity program\nand management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five years of experience in information\nsecurity, and his background includes technical experience, strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and\nthreat experience, and various leadership roles.\nGovernance - board oversight\nThe Company’s Board of Directors oversees the overall risk management process, including cybersecurity risks,\ndirectly and through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee (RCSC) of the board is\nprimarily responsible for oversight of risk from cybersecurity threats and oversees compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and Company policies related to, among others, privacy and cybersecurity.\nRCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others, those\nrelating to cybersecurity. The CISO provides at least two updates each year to RCSC on cybersecurity matters. These\nreports include an overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key cybersecurity initiatives to improve the\nCompany’s risk posture, changes in the legal and regulatory landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of\ncertain cybersecurity incidents that have occurred within the Company and within the industry.\n2023 Annual Report17"

Increased sales of STELARA (ustekinumab) were primarily driven by patient mix, market growth, and\ncontinued strength in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth,\ncontinued strength in PsO/PsA (Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis) and patient mix. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI\nARIA growth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar\ncompetition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a\nresult of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the\nlaunch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States.\nInfectious disease products sales were $4.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 18.9% as compared to the prior year\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA .\nNeuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% as compared to the prior\nyear. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by ongoing launches as well as increased physician confidence\nand patient demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and the paliperidone\nlong-acting injectables outside the U.S. due to the XEPLION loss of exclusivity in the European Union.\nOncology products achieved sales of $17.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 10.5% as compared to the\nprior year. Sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth.\nGrowth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth in Metastatic Castration\nResistant Prostate Cancer. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by the ongoing launch, share\ngains and capacity improvement. Additionally, sales from the launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and TALVEY\n(talquetamab-tgvs), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA\n(abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of 11.6% as compared to the prior\nyear. Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and\nOPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 5.5% as compared to the prior year.\nThe decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and access changes.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy had\ndiscount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2023.\n26\nDuring 2023, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and\nadditional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nProduct Name                       Indication                          US          EU          US        EU\n(Chemical Name)                                                        Approval    Approval    Filing    Filing\nFirst-And-Only Dual Action\nAKEEGA (Niraparib and              Tablet for the Treatment of\nAbiraterone                        Patients with BRCA-Positive\nAcetate)                           Metastatic Castration-Resistant\nProstate Cancer (MAGNITUDE)\nTreatment of Patients with\nLocally Advanced or Metastatic\nBALVERSA (erdafitinib)             Urothelial Carcinoma and\nSelected Fibroblast Growth\nFactor Receptor Gene Alterations\n(THOR)\nCARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene           Treatment for Relapsed and\nautoleucel)                        Refactor multiple myeloma with\n1-3 PL (CARTITUDE-4)\nEDURANT (rilpivirine)              Treatment for pediatric patients\n(2-12 years old) with HIV\nERLEADA                            Tablet reduction\n(apalutamide)\nOPSUMIT (macitentan)               Treatment for pediatric\npulmonary arterial hypertension\nOPSYNVI (mecitentan/tadalafil      Treatment for pulmonary arterial\nSTCT)                              hypertension\nIn Combination with Chemotherapy\nfor the First-Line Treatment of\nRYBREVANT (amivantamab)            Adult Patients with Advanced\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer with\nActivating EGFR Exon 20\nInsertion Mutations (PAPILLON)\nRYBREVANT / lazertinib             Treatment for Non-Small Cell\nLung Cancer 2L (MARIPOSA)\nRYBREVANT / lazertinib             Treatment for Non-Small Cell\nLung Cancer 2L (MARIPOSA-2)\nTreatment of Patients with\nTECVAYLI (teclistamab)             Relapsed Refractory Multiple\nMyeloma Biweekly Dosing\nTreatment of Patients with\nTALVEY (talquetamab)               Relapsed and Refractory Multiple\nMyeloma\n2023 Annual Report27\nMedTech segment\nThe MedTech segment sales in 2023 were $30.4 billion, an increase of 10.8% from 2022, which included operational\ngrowth of 12.4% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%.

Interest\nexpense in the fiscal year 2023 was $0.8 billion as compared to interest expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year\n2022 primarily due to higher interest rates on debt balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\ntotaled $22.9 billion at the end of 2023, and averaged $22.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities total of $22.3 billion and $26.9 billion average balance in 2022.

The decrease\nin the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\nHigher amortization expense of $0.5 billion in 2023 related to Abiomed\nExpense of $0.4 billion for an acquired in process research and development asset from the Laminar acquisition in\n2023\nCommodity inflation in 2023\npartially offset by\nIncome from litigation settlements of $0.1 billion in 2023 versus expense of $0.6 billion in 2022\nLower integration/acquisition costs related to Abiomed of $0.2 billion in 2023 versus $0.3 billion in 2022\nLeveraging in selling and marketing expenses in 2023\nRestructuring: In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development\n(R&D) investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest\nbenefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits\nare primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5\nbillion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded\nin Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, included the termination of partnered and non-\npartnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the\nMedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network\narrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $40 million was\nrecorded in Restructuring and $279 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings, primarily included inventory and instrument charges related to market and product exits.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion related to a restructuring program of its Global\nSupply Chain. The Global Supply Chain program was announced in the second quarter of 2018 and was completed in the\nfiscal fourth quarter of 2022.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\n32\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 11.5% in 2023\nand 15.4% in 2022.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar 2 legislation with an initial effective date\nof January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as\nresult of this legislation the 2024 effective tax rate will increase by approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points\ncompared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation, guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well\nas other business events, may impact this estimate.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2023 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nLiquidity & cash flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $21.9 billion at the end of 2023 as compared to $14.1 billion at the end of 2022.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $7.8 billion increase were:\n(Dollars in billions)\n$14.1    Q4 2022 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n22.8    cash generated from operating activities\n0.9    net cash from investing activities\n-15.8    net cash used by financing activities\n-0.1    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$21.9    Q4 2023 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $1.1 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2023 and $9.4 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2022.

As of December 31, 2023, the net debt position was $6.4 billion as compared to the prior\nyear of $17.4 billion. The debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3 billion as compared to $39.6 billion in 2022.\nConsidering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile\nand does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the\nability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and\naccess to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,\nincluding the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately\n$2.1 billion and the establishment of the approximately $9 billion reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital\nmarkets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444\nshares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of\n$22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book\nvalue of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital.\nAs of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue\nCommon Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected\nin equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common\nStock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson\ncommon stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the\nCompany owns 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within\ncontinuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer,\n34\nJohnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue.\nThis resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued\noperations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-\ntime gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the\nexchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program,\nauthorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock. In the fiscal year 2022,\napproximately $2.5 billion was repurchased under the program. In the fiscal year 2023, $2.5 billion has been\nrepurchased and the repurchase program was completed.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nDecember 31, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\n(Dollars in Millions)    Tax Legislation (TCJA)    Debt Obligations         Interest on     Total\nDebt Obligations\n2024                                     $2,029               1,469                 843     4,341\n2025                                      2,536               1,700                 789     5,025\n2026                                          —               1,997                 744     2,741\n2027                                          —               2,320                 736     3,056\n2028                                          —               2,325                 691     3,016\nAfter 2028                                    —              17,539               8,706    26,245\nTotal                                    $4,565              27,350              12,509    44,424\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2023 Annual Report35\nFinancing and market risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December\n31, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In\neither scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.6 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.8 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2023, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 5, 2024. The Company early\nterminated the additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which had an expiration of November 21,\n2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees\nunder the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $29.3 billion and $39.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in\nthe debt balance was due to the repayment of commercial paper. In 2023, net debt (cash and current marketable\nsecurities, net of debt) was $6.4 billion compared to net debt of $17.4 billion in 2022. Total debt represented\n30.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2023 and 34.0% of total capital in 2022.\nShareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2023 was $28.57 compared to $29.39 at year-end 2022.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2023 for the 61st consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.70 per share\nin 2023 and $4.45 per share in 2022.\nOn January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on March 5,\n2024 to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024.\n36\nOther information\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively\nnot resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2023, 2022\nand 2021.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales\nvolumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to\ndetermine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns\nprofit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to\ncustomers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0%\nof the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n2023 Annual Report37\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1,\n2023.\nInnovative Medicine segment\nBalance at                         Payments/              Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning              Accruals    Credits(2)             End of\nof Period                                                 Period\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $12,289      47,523                -45,151                14,661\nAccrued returns                                  649         332                   -347                   634\nAccrued promotions                                 1          12                     -7                     6\nSubtotal                                     $12,939      47,867                -45,505                15,301\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     44           0                    -11                    33\nReserve for cash discounts                       110       1,386                 -1,385                   111\nTotal                                        $13,093      49,253                -46,901                15,445\n2022\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $10,331      43,026                -41,068                12,289\nAccrued returns                                  520         444                   -315                   649\nAccrued promotions                                 3           5                     -7                     1\nSubtotal                                     $10,854      43,475                -41,390                12,939\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     50           0                     -6                    44\nReserve for cash discounts                        94       1,281                 -1,265                   110\nTotal                                        $10,998      44,756                -42,661                13,093\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $165 million at December 31, 2023 and $203 million at January 1, 2023,\nrecorded as a contra asset.\n(2) Includes prior period adjustments\n38\nMedTech segment\nBalance at                Payments/    Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning of    Accruals      Credits        End of\nPeriod                                 Period\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,470       6,241       -6,256         1,455\nAccrued returns                           134         555         -564           125\nAccrued promotions                         43          74          -92            25\nSubtotal                               $1,647       6,870       -6,912         1,605\nReserve for doubtful accounts             125          33          -25           133\nReserve for cash discounts                  9          96         -100             5\nTotal                                  $1,781       6,999       -7,037         1,743\n2022\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,446       6,131       -6,107         1,470\nAccrued returns                           134         531         -531           134\nAccrued promotions                         54         102         -113            43\nSubtotal                               $1,634       6,764       -6,751         1,647\nReserve for doubtful accounts             148           6          -29           125\nReserve for cash discounts                 10          99         -100             9\nTotal                                  $1,792       6,869       -6,880         1,781\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $740 million at December 31, 2023 and $802 million at January 1, 2023,\nrecorded as a contra asset.\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n2023 Annual Report39\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for\nthe two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on\nthe date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends,\nwhich are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2023.\n40\nEconomic and market factors\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2013 - 2023, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey (beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022) as highly\ninflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact\nto the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit\nmargins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn December 2023, the Argentine government devalued the peso by approximately 50%. During 2023, the Company\nrecorded a charge of approximately $130 million related to operations in Argentina due to the application of highly\ninflationary accounting. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s Argentine subsidiaries represented less than 1.0%\nof the Company's consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues and profits from continuing operations; therefore, the\neffect of a change in the exchange rate is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 2024\nfull-year results.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was\nnot material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the business of\nthe Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1%\nof revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.\nIn early March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the financial\nimpact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not\nmaterial. As of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries\nrepresented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2023 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.2\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\n2023 Annual Report41\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which\na loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments\nabout future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 9, 2024,\nthere were 118,772 record holders of Common Stock of the Company."

Summary of significant accounting policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the company and business segments\nThe Company has approximately 131,900employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nKenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of\n198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an initial public\noffering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the\nnet book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $ 2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in\ncapital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares\nof Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was\nreflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2023.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of the shares of\nKenvue through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5% of the shares of Kenvue which\nare accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within continuing operations. The historical\nresults of the Consumer Health business (which previously represented the Consumer Health business segment) are\nreflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the\nexchange offer (see Note 21 for additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements refer only to Johnson & Johnson’s continuing operations.\nBusiness segments\nFollowing the completion of the exchange offer, the Company is organized into twobusiness segments: Innovative\nMedicine and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including\nImmunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic\ndiseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and\nhealthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in\nthe Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision fields. These products are distributed to\nwholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses,\nhospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nNew accounting standards\nRecently adopted accounting standards\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\nObligations\nThe Company adopted the standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2023, which requires that a buyer in a supplier\nfinance program disclose additional information about the program for financial statement users.\nThe Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs\nprovide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment\ndates (which have general payment terms of 90 days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to\nparticipate in the program.\n50\nAs of both December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, $ 0.7billion were valid obligations under the program. The\nobligations are presented as Accounts payableon the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently issued accounting standards\nNot adopted as of December 31, 2023\nASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThis update requires expanded annual and interim disclosures for significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.\nThis update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and is to be applied\nretrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. As this\naccounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThis update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires disaggregation of income\ntaxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required to be effective for the Company for\nfiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they\nare classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and\nequity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The\nCompany reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as\nrequired.\nProperty, plant and equipment and depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment    30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the\n2023 Annual Report51\ncarrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the\ndifference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the\nCompany will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates,\nreturns, and promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 11.5billion and $ 9.6billion as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively\nnot resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years\n2023, 2022 and 2021.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales\nvolumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to\ndetermine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns\nprofit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to\ncustomers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0%\nof the total revenues in the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 0.9billion, $ 0.8billion and $ 0.8billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible assets and goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2023 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment\n52\ntests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process\nresearch and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is\ncompleted, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If\nwarranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written off or partially impaired depending on\nthe underlying program.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit\nprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based\nmeasurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The\nauthoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value,\nwith Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\nare recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is\ndesignated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment.The ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operation was $ 1.0billion in both fiscal years 2023\nand 2022. The lease liability from continuing operations was $ 1.1billion in both fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The\noperating lease costs from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash paid\nfor amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal\nyears 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nProduct liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\n2023 Annual Report53\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 0.5billion, $ 0.7billion and $ 1.2billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany\n54\nestimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax\nlaws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will\ncontinue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2023 was approximately $ 4.5billion, of which $\n2.5billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nAnnual closing date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\n2023 Annual Report55\n2.

Fair value measurements\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows,\nprimarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of\nmaterials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related\nto fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency\ninterest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the\nCompany uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and\nliabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the\nfair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the\nrelated foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company\nunder the CSA amounted to $ 4.0billion and $ 0.8billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow\nhedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-\nperformance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that\nhave at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross\ncurrency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion,\nrespectively. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 41.5billion, $ 36.2billion and $\n10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income was $ 377million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward\nforeign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions\nthat are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging\ntransaction exposure is 18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount\nultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are\nultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\n2023 Annual Report59\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to

Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2.

This benefit was offset by approximately $ 0.1billion of U.S. deferred tax expense on the\nGILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected\nin the “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax as a result of an international\nsubsidiary making an election to change the treatment of a local deferred tax asset to a refundable tax credit.\nThis has been reflected in the U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate\nreconciliation.\nThe Company’s 2023 and 2022 tax rates benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that\nbecame effective in fiscal 2022. The Company also had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions vs. fiscal year\n2022, primarily in the U.S. where the Company recorded an approximately $ 7.0billion charge related to talc matters\nin the United States at an effective tax rate of 21.1% (for further information see Note 19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\nThe fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 8.2% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate as\nthe Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in an unfavorable\nimpact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are\ndescribed below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited from the impairment of bermekimab for AD IPR&D and\nchanges in the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory\nrate.\n2023 Annual Report67\nIn the fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international\nsubsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value\nin accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $\n0.6billion net benefit or 3.2% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following\nitems:\napproximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these\nassets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as U.S. taxes on international\nincome on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 effective tax rate by approximately\n1.6% which is reflected as a Tax benefits from loss on capital assets on the effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAdditionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related\nitems as follows:\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an effective tax rate of\n23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the\nAuris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n2023 Deferred Tax                          2022 Deferred Tax\n(Dollars in Millions)                              Asset    Liability                        Asset    Liability\nEmployee related                                    $586                                       685\nobligations\nStock based compensation                             686                                       632\nDepreciation of property,\nplant and                                                        -902                                      -845\nequipment\nGoodwill and intangibles                                       -1,252                                    -1,737\nR&D capitalized for tax                            3,595                                     2,611\nReserves & liabilities                             3,816                                     2,733\nIncome reported for tax                              359                                     2,026\npurposes(1)\nNet realizable operating\nloss                                                 996                                     1,319\ncarryforwards(2)\nUndistributed foreign                              1,801       -1,695                        1,517       -1,604\nearnings\nGlobal intangible                                              -2,731                                    -3,628\nlow-taxed income\nMiscellaneous                                        831                                       861          -66\ninternational\nMiscellaneous U.S.                                                 -4                          452\nTotal deferred income                            $12,670       -6,584                       12,836       -7,880\ntaxes\n(1) In fiscal 2023, the Company changed the presentation of income taxes accrued on intercompany profits on\ninventory still owned by the Company as part of “Prepaid expenses and other” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Net of valuation allowances of $ 1.1billion and $ 0.8billion in 2023 and 2022. The change in the valuation\nallowance from 2022 to 2023 was driven by approximately $ 0.1billion from acquisition related activity and the\nremainder was due to normal operations during the fiscal year.\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that\nit is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these\ndeferred tax assets.

The Company\nconducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a\nnumber of tax authorities. With respect to the United States the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit\nfor all tax years through 2016.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back\nto the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve\nmonths by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States. However, the Company is not\nable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in\nuncertain tax positions, if any.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax\nexpense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 99million, $ 136million and $ 42million in fiscal\nyears 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 264million and $ 637million in\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n9.

Pensions and other benefit plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2023 and 2022 the Company used December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2023,\n2022 and 2021 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans                                Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in                               2023      2022      2021                         2023    2022    2021\nMillions)\nService cost                              $893     1,319     1,412                          264     320     309\nInterest cost                            1,437       908       768                          214     104      80\nExpected return on                      -2,716    -2,756    -2,644                           -7      -8      -7\nplan assets\nAmortization of                           -184      -184      -181                           -2      -5     -31\nprior service cost\nRecognized\nactuarial losses                          -199       650     1,251                           23     122     151\n(gains)\nCurtailments and                            93         1         1                           -5       —       —\nsettlements\nNet periodic\nbenefit cost                            $(676)       -62       607                          487     533     502\n(credit)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue. All other components of net periodic\nbenefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with\nthe exception of certain amounts for curtailments and settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue (as noted above).\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\n70\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement                                             Other\nPlans                                           Benefit\nPlans\nWorldwide\nBenefit                      2023          2022          2021                  2023          2022          2021\nPlans\nNet\nPeriodic\nBenefit\nCost\nService\ncost                   4.85     %    2.46          2.14                  5.40          2.59          2.09\ndiscount\nrate\nInterest\ncost                   5.25     %    2.80          2.34                  5.43          2.64          2.33\ndiscount\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.71     %    4.02          4.01                  4.22          4.21          4.25\ncompensati…\nlevels\nExpected\nlong-term\nrate of                7.21     %    7.25          7.71\nreturn on\nplan assets\nBenefit\nObligation\nDiscount               4.58     %    5.01          2.49                  5.11          5.42          2.68\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.69     %    4.00          4.01                  4.22          4.21          4.21\ncompensati…\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments.

A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants\nand are expected to be on-going plans.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets\nin the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\nOther assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are\nvalued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded\nare classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\n74\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nQuo…\nPri…                                                              Inv…\nin                    Sig…                  Sig…                  Mea…\nAct…                  Oth…                  Uno…                  at\nMar…                  Obs…                  Inp…                  Net\nfor                   Inp…                                        Ass…\nIde…                                                              Val…\nAss…\n-Le…                  -Le…                  -Le…                                        To…\n1                     2                     3                                           As…\n(D…\nin           2023    2022          2023    2022          2023    2022          2023    2022         2023    20…\nMi…\nSh…\nin…           $12      26           829      13             —       —             —       —          841     39\nfu…\nGo…\nand             —       —          5,9…    5,8…             —       —             —       —         5,9…    5,…\nag…\nse…\nDe…             —       —          3,8…    3,6…             —       —             —       —         3,8…    3,…\nin…\nEq…          7,7…    8,8…             —       2             —       —             —       —         7,7…    8,…\nse…\nCo…             —       —          4,9…    4,3…            43      56          6,6…    6,0…         11,…    10…\nfu…\nOt…             —       —            49      33            92      12          3,2…    2,5…         3,4…    2,…\nas…\nIn…\nat           $7,…    8,8…          15,…    13,…           135      68          9,9…    8,6…         33,…    31…\nfa…\nva…\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 86million and $\n78million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 14million ( 0.0% of total plan\nassets) at December 31, 2023 and $ 21million ( 0.1% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2022.\n11.

International currency translation\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the\nlocal currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly\ninflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or\nmore during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.\nFor the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second\nquarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of\nbalance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 366million, $\n286million and $ 216million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n2023 Annual Report77\n15.

Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had onestock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts\nunder the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share\nunits) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of which up to 110million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis\nagainst the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are granted, each full value\naward in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for\nfuture grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 130million at the end of fiscal year 2023.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,087million, $ 1,028million and $\n1,038million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 221million, $ 177million and $ 199million for fiscal\nyears 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n126million, $ 267million and $ 213million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 907million, $\n866million and $ 775million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted average period for\nthis cost to be recognized was 1.80years, 1.80years and 1.78years for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\n78\nStock options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years.\nOptions granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the average of the high and low prices of\nthe Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2022\nLong-Term incentive Plan were granted at the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock\nExchange on the date of gran t.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2023, 2022, and 2021 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe average fair value of options granted was $ 27.85, $ 23.23and $ 20.86, in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:\n2023           2022           2021\nRisk-free rate               3.74     %     1.98     %     0.83     %\nExpected volatility         17.69     %    18.00     %    18.59     %\nExpected life (in years)            7.0            7.0            7.0\nExpected dividend yield      2.90     %     2.70     %     2.50     %\nA summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 31, 2023, is presented below:\nWeighted                Aggregate\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding    Average Exercise                Intrinsic\nShares               Price                    Value\n(Dollars in Millions)\nShares at January 1, 2023          118,672             $134.95                   $4,949\nOptions granted                     16,320              162.75\nOptions exercised                  -12,386              109.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited*        -10,368              155.62\nShares at December 31, 2023        112,238             $139.88                   $2,239\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 729million, $ 1,228million and $ 919million in fiscal years\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n*includes 7,689shares of options cancelled as a result of the conversion of Johnson & Johnson stock options held by\nKenvue employees into Kenvue stock options\n2023 Annual Report79\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2023:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                  Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise                    Options    Average                   Average                 Options        Average\nPrice Range                            Life(1)                  Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$90.44-                      20,774                  1.4          $99.21                  20,774         $99.21\n$101.87\n$115.67-                     19,368                  3.6          122.49                  19,368         122.49\n$129.51\n$131.94-                     27,391                  5.6          142.84                  26,676         142.61\n$151.41\n$162.70-                     13,928                  9.1          162.75                       6         162.75\n$162.75\n$164.62-                     30,777                  7.6          165.29                     174         165.12\n$165.89\n112,238                  5.5         $139.88                  66,998        $123.39\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 were 118,672and an average life of 5.8years and\n117,361and an average life of 5.8years, respectively.

In\nfiscal year 2022, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for both segments that represented\napproximately 18.9%, 15.0% and 13.8% of the total consolidated revenues. In fiscal year 2021, the Company had three\nwholesalers distributing products for all threesegments that represented approximately 16.6%, 12.6%, and 12.6% of\nthe total consolidated revenues.\n(1) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income)/expense and general corporate (income)/expense.\nFiscal 2023 includes an approximately $ 7billion charge related to talc matters (See Note 19, Legal proceedings,\nfor additional details) and $ 0.4billion related to the unfavorable change in the fair value of the retained stake\nin Kenvue.\n(2) General corporate includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n(3) Innovative Medicine includes:\nOne-time COVID-19 Vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $ 0.7billion\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.5billion\nUnfavorable changes in the fair value of securities of $ 0.4billion\nFavorable litigation related items of $ 0.1billion\nLoss on divestiture $ 0.2billion.\nAn intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.2billion related to market dynamics associated with a\nnon-strategic asset (M710) acquired as part of the acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals in 2020.\nMedTech includes:\nAcquired in process research and development asset of $ 0.4billion related to the Laminar acquisition in 2023\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.3billion\nAcquisition and integration related costs of $ 0.2billion primarily related to the acquisition of Abiomed\nA Medical Device Regulation charge of $ 0.3billion\nIncome from litigation settlements of $ 0.1billion\n(4) Innovative Medicine includes:\nOne-time COVID-19 Vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $ 1.5billion\nAn intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.8billion related to an in-process research and\ndevelopment asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD)\nand Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) acquired with the acquisition of XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020.\nAdditional information regarding efficacy of the AD and HS indications became available which led the Company to\nthe decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for AD and HS\nLitigation expense of $ 0.1billion\nUnfavorable changes in the fair value of securities of $ 0.7billion\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.1billion\nMedTech includes:\nLitigation expense of $ 0.6billion primarily for pelvic mesh related costs\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.3billion\nAcquisition and integration related costs of $ 0.3billion primarily related to the acquisition of Abiomed\nA Medical Device Regulation charge of $ 0.3billion\n(5) Innovative Medicine includes:\nLitigation expense of $ 0.6billion, primarily related to Risperdal Gynecomastia\nDivestiture gains of $ 0.6billion\nGains of $ 0.5billion related to the change in the fair value of securities\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.1billion\nMedTech includes:\nAn in-process research and development expense of $ 0.9billion related to Ottava\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.3billion\nA Medical Device Regulation charge of $ 0.2billion\n2023 Annual Report87\nLitigation expense of $ 0.1billion\n(6) Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net for fiscal years 2023, and 2022 of $ 19,898and $\n17,982, respectively, and intangible assets and goodwill, net for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 of $ 70,733and $\n74,536, respectively.\n18. Acquisitions and divestitures\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire\nAmbrx Biopharma, Inc., or Ambrx (Nasdaq: AMAM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary\nsynthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an\nall-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.9billion net of\nestimated cash acquired. The Company will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $\n28.00per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The closing of the transaction is\nexpected to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to receipt of Ambrx shareholder approval, as well as clearance\nunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The Company expects\nthat the transaction will be accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations will be included\nin the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, there were asset acquisitions of in-process research and development of approximately\n$ 0.5billion in cash, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Laminar Inc. for $ 0.4billion which was closed on\nNovember 30, 2023. Laminar Inc. is a privately-held medical device company focused on eliminating the left atrial\nappendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib).\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7billion in cash and $ 1.1billion of\nliabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results\nof operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 17.3billion\nand has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not\nmaterial.\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\nthe Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\nrecovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and the results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the\nacquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash\nacquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $\n35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if\ncertain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into\naccount the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nacquired.\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\na. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson & Johnson’s\nfiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this\nperiod and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;\nb. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in ST-elevated\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\nc. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella® products\nin high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical\nendpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In the fiscal 2023,\nthere were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $ 0.2billion with an offsetting increase\nto goodwill. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 20.1billion (net of $\n0.3billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $ 11.1billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6billion,\nIPR&D for $ 1.1billion, marketable securities of $ 0.6billion and\n88\nliabilities assumed of $ 3.0billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration mentioned above\nfor $ 0.7billion and deferred taxes of $ 2.0billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial\nacceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent\nconsideration was recorded in Other Liabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2023 on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella® platform\nwith an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved\nproducts. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the\nrisk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied\nwas 9.5%.\nIn 2023, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.2billion, which was\nprimarily recorded in Other (income)/expense. In 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of\napproximately $ 0.3billion, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions that qualified as a business\ncombination.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nDivestitures\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds\nresulting in gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily\nintangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet that it expects to divest of approximately $ 0.3billion primarily\nrelated to Acclarent and Ponvory.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\nInnovative Medicine segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\n19. Legal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability\nwill be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has\ndetermined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably\nestimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and\nadjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC\n450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\n2023 Annual Report89\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against Johnson\n& Johnson Consumer Inc., its successor LTL Management LLC (now known as LLT Management LLC) and the Company arising\nout of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &\nJohnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer\nof the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari,\nseeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company\npaid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances,\nincluding the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought\nagainst the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc\nverdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in\ncertain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and threenew entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed, although LTL did agree to lift the stay on\na small number of appeals where appeal bonds had been filed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United\nStates Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case\nand, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in March 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\nLTL filed a petition for rehearing of the Third Circuit’s decision, which was denied in March 2023. LTL\nsubsequently filed a motion in the Third Circuit to stay the mandate directing the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to\ndismiss the LTL bankruptcy pending filing and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States\nSupreme Court. The Third Circuit denied the motion to stay the mandate and issued the mandate.\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal\ncourt ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was\npermitted to proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. On July 28,\n2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.\n90\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed and cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a multi-district litigation (MDL)\nin the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, case-specific discovery is\nproceeding with an expectation that a trial will occur in early 2025. Separately, discovery and pre-trial activity\nis underway in various individually filed and set cases around the country, with most activity for such cases\ncentralized in New Jersey and California.\nIn the original bankruptcy case, the Company agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New\nJersey Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of\nthis purpose. The Company established a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned\ntrust. During the bankruptcy proceedings LTL had been de-consolidated by the Company. In the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case,\nthe Company had agreed to contribute an additional amount which, when added to the prior $ 2billion, would be a\ntotal reserve of approximately $ 9billion payable over 25years (nominal value approximately $ 12billion discounted\nat a rate of 4.41%), to resolve all the current and future talc claims. The approximate $ 9billion reserve\nencompasses actual and contemplated settlements, of which approximately one-third is recorded as a current\nliability. The recorded amount remains the Company’s best estimate of probable loss after the dismissal.\nThe parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to estimate the\npossible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\nA class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey\nstate court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the\nCompany fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc\nmined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor\nMinerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the\nEdley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to\ndismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court.\nArgument on the motions was heard in November 2023. Thereafter, the Company resolved this matter.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nchapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties.\nThe Imerys Plan proceeded to solicitation in early 2021. However, the Imerys Plan did not receive the requisite\nnumber of votes to be confirmed after the Bankruptcy Court ruled certain votes cast in favor of the Imerys Plan\nshould be disregarded. Imerys subsequently canceled its confirmation hearing.\nImerys, the Imerys Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Imerys Future Claimants’ Representative, along with Cyprus,\nthe Cyprus Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Cyprus Future Claimants’ Representative (collectively the Mediation\nParties) have been engaged in mediation since shortly after the confirmation hearing was canceled in October 2021.\nIn September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending the term of the mediation among the Mediation\nParties through the end of December 2023. The Bankruptcy Court also authorized Imerys and Cyprus to proceed with\nmediation with certain of their insurers through the end of December 2023.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. In January 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed revised TDP. In February 2024, Imerys and Cyprus\nfiled certain motions related to their Disclosure Statement.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In\n2023 Annual Report91\nDecember 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for\nclass certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was\nreopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January\n2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission\nto appeal the Court’s order granting class certification. Fact discovery is proceeding.\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In\nJuly 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved\nto dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response\nto those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\nthird amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint\nbut indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a\nFifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in\nthe Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice\nof Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its\nresponsive brief in October 2021. After the Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit, a\nstay was imposed, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In September 2023, the stay lifted. With\nbriefing complete, the Court is expected to either schedule oral argument or issue its decision at any time.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District\nof Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi\nConsumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc\ncontained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive\nand monetary relief. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However,\nin October 2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued\nthe mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The State requested a new trial setting. Later in\nApril 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April 2024. The Company filed summary judgment and Daubert\nmotions. The State filed a limited Daubert motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request for mediation. A\npretrial conference is set for February 2024 and trial is scheduled for April 2024. However, the Company is\nactively engaged in resolution discussions concerning this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to\ncompel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for\ninterlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a\nRequest for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.\nIn April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and\nthe State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court,\nwhich expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State filed an\nappeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court\ngranted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s\ndiscovery obligations. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and\nin April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation in April\n2023, the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and it remains in effect.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia (including Mississippi and New Mexico) have commenced a joint\ninvestigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has\nnot asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents\nand other information. The Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and\nentered into confidentiality agreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In\nMarch 2022, each of the forty-two states agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July\n2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL\nBankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. In March 2023, the mediation was\nterminated. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state\nAttorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. The unique procedural history and status\nof the New Mexico and Mississippi matters specifically have been discussed above.\n92\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local\ngovernments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not\nlimited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS);\nhospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle with a negotiating committee of state\nAttorneys General to settle all remaining government opioid litigation claims nationwide. Under the final national\nsettlement agreement, which was announced in July 2021, the Company agreed to pay up to $ 5.0billion to resolve all\nopioid lawsuits and future opioid claims by states, cities, counties, local school districts and other special\ndistricts, and tribal governments, contingent on sufficient participation by eligible government entities, and with\ncredits back for entities that declined or were ineligible to participate. In July 2021, the Company announced that\nthe terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately 60% of\nthe all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal 2023. The expected payment schedule provides that approximately\n$ 0.7billion of payments are to be paid by the end of fiscal 2024. The agreement is not an admission of liability\nor wrongdoing, and it provides for the release of all opioid-related claims against the Company, JPI, and their\naffiliates (including the Company’s former subsidiaries Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc.). As of\nJanuary 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government\nentity claimants except the City of Baltimore, a number of school districts and other claimants.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. Counting\nthe private litigant cases, there are approximately 35remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various\nstate courts, 430remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 4additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these\ncases have been dismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in\n2024 or 2025.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. These actions\nallege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition,\npublic nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An\nadverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and\nsignificant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other\nsanctions.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent\ncounsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to\nthe Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or\nappropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations\nof the independent counsel’s report.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints\nmaking similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal\ncourts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022,\nthe state court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the\nsecond case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for\nreconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently\ndenied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order.\n2023 Annual Report93\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of December 31, 2023:\nProduct or product category                                  Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S    59,140\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip        160\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                          920\nPelvic meshes                                         6,720\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh              370\nRISPERDAL                                               200\nELMIRON                                               2,150\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States\n94\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in\nfederal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the\nUnited States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve\nthese cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an\naccrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related\nsettlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nBelgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South\nAfrica. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to\nliability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and\npost-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress\nurinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company\nreached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia and in March 2023 the\nFederal Court approved the settlement. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a\nsettlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The\nparties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the\nsettlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability\nlitigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All\ndeadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement\nagreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 3,390have been dismissed with prejudice. Ethicon has received releases\nfrom 3,584plaintiffs, and releases continue to be submitted as part of the settlement process. Post-settlement\ncases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and\ndiscovery requirements. In May 2023, Ethicon entered an additional settlement to resolve the claims of\n292Physiomesh claimants. That settlement is proceeding, and releases are being returned. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere were 5Physiomesh cases in the MDL and 3in the New Jersey MCL which are not included in either settlement and\nwhich remain subject to the docket control orders.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\n2023 Annual Report95\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nRISPERDAL\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully\ndefended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October\n2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in\nJanuary 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing\nplaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs\nassociated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. All cases in the multi-district\nlitigation are in active discussions regarding resolution, and as a result, all activity is stayed. In addition,\ncases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county\nlitigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and\ngranted mass tort designation. No activity has taken place in the New Jersey state court litigation; however, three\nbellwether trials have been set in Philadelphia for March, April and May 2024. In addition, three class action\nlawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has\nestablished accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non- cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions\n96\nand such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior\nto the expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents. The following entities are named defendants: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,\nLtd.; Lupin Limited; Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.,\nInc.; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Mankind Pharma Limited; Apotex Inc.;\nApotex Corp.; Auson Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Macleods Pharma USA, Inc.; Indoco Remedies\nLimited; FPP Holding Company LLC; Umedica Laboratories Pvt.

The following U.S. patents are included in one\nor more cases: 9,539,218 and 10,828,310.\nU.S. Patent No. 10,828,310 was also under consideration by the USPTO in an IPR proceeding. In July 2023, the USPTO\nissued a final written decision finding the claims of the patent invalid. In September 2023, Bayer Pharma AG filed\nan appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nOPSUMIT\nBeginning in January 2023 Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. filed patent\ninfringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking\napproval to market generic versions of OPSUMIT before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed Patents. The\nfollowing entities are named defendants: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries,\nInc.; MSN Laboratories Private Limited; MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. The following U.S.\npatents are included in one or more cases: 7,094,781; and 10,946,015. In November 2023, the Company entered into a\nconfidential settlement agreement with MSN Laboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc. In December\n2023, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and\nSun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc.\nINVEGA SUSTENNA\nBeginning in January 2018, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed patent infringement\nlawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking approval to\nmarket generic versions of INVEGA SUSTENNA before expiration of the Orange Book Listed Patent. The following\nentities are named defendants: Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Laboratories Limited; Pharmascience Inc.;\nMallinckrodt PLC; Specgx LLC; Tolmar, Inc.; and Accord Healthcare, Inc.

Kenvue separation and discontinued operations\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of\n198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an initial public\noffering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the\nnet book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $ 2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in\ncapital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares\nof Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was\nreflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2023.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common\nStock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $ 31.4billion of Johnson & Johnson\ncommon stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the\nCompany owns 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within\ncontinuing operations at the fair market value of $ 4.3billion as of August 23, 2023. Subsequent changes are\nreflected in other income/expense and amounted to $ 0.4billion expense through December 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $ 11.6billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $ 4.3billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $ 1.2billion to record the\ndeconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a non-cash gain on the exchange offer of $ 21.0billion that was\nrecorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for\nthe fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $ 2.8billion on the Kenvue Common Stock\nretained by Johnson & Johnson.

The\nprovision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24months following the Kenvue IPO.\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson will manufacture\nand supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and supply to Johnson & Johnson\ncertain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from 3months to 5years.\nAmounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were immaterial for the\nfiscal year 2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for the above agreements was not material as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as well as the\nassociated gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nearnings as Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this\npresentation. As a result of the separation of Kenvue, Johnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $ 986million,\n$ 1,089million and $ 67million in the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are also included in\nNet earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes.

We\nalso have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n106\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves – managed care, medicare and medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $11.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nrebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical\nexperience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation contingencies – talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. The Company has recognized a total provision of approximately $9 billion, of which\napproximately one-third is recorded as a current liability and which encompasses actual and contemplated\nsettlements. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss after the dismissal. The\nparties have not yet reached a full resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to estimate the\npossible loss or range of loss beyond the remaining amount accrued.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred, when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing\ntalc claims can be made, and when determining the timing of any settlement payments, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment\nof the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\n2023 Annual Report107\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) obtaining and evaluating certain executed\nsettlement agreements related to the talc litigation (iii) discussing the status of significant known actual and\npotential litigation and settlements activity with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external\ncounsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and\nexternal legal counsel for significant litigation; (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment\nregarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (vi)\nevaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 16, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n108\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December\n31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,\nwhich appears herein.\n/s/J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and\nparticipated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on internal control over financial reporting.

During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to\nmonitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment."

Business\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 138,100 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer).\nThe Executive Committee is Johnson & Johnson’s senior leadership team responsible for setting the strategy and\npriorities of the Company and driving accountability at all levels. Within the strategic parameters provided by the\nExecutive Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible\nfor their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies.\nSegments of business\nThe Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional information\nrequired by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and\noperating results under: Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial\ncondition of this Report; and Note 17 Segments of business and geographic areas of the notes to consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nInnovative Medicine\nThe Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid\narthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS),\nNeuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate\ncancer, hematologic malignancies, lung cancer and bladder cancer), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis,\ndiabetes and macular degeneration) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension).

Key products in the Innovative Medicine segment include: REMICADE (infliximab),\na treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment\nfor adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis\nand moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for\nadults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis\nand active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA\n(ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active\npsoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to\nseverely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque\npsoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA (darunavir) and\nPREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA\n(darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of\nHIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective\ndisorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients\nafter they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; SPRAVATO (Esketamine), a\nnasal spray, used along with an oral antidepressant, to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and\ndepressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts or actions; CARVYKTI\n(ciltacabtagene autoleucel), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with\nrelapsed/refractory multiple\n2024 Annual Report1\nmyeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a\nnext-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA\n(ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease;\nDARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a\ntreatment for multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), a ready-to-use\nbispecific antibody for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior\nlines of therapy; XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT),\nwhich may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the\nrisk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and\nreduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for the treatment and secondary prevention of\nthromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients following the Fontan\nprocedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of\npulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, selective IP\nreceptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration\nwith strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the cardiovascular, orthopaedics, surgery, and\nvision categories. The Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional solutions) portfolio includes\nelectrophysiology products to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes\ntechnologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, circulatory\nrestoration products (Shockwave) for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery\ndisease (PAD), and neurovascular care that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio\nincludes products and enabling technologies that support hips, knees, trauma, spine, sports, and others. The\nSurgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies, as well as solutions that focus on breast\naesthetics and reconstruction (Mentor). Vision products include ACUVUE brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular\nlenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers and are used\npredominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals, and clinics.\nGeographic areas\nThe Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to\nhuman health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those\ndescribed above under Segments of Business – Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets,\nproducts and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The\nproducts sold in the international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings\n2\nand claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19 Legal\nproceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and\nhyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 13.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2024.\nAccordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.\nThe two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound/use patent protection in\nselect countries extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX\nFASPRO.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 11.7% of the\nCompany's total revenues for fiscal 2024. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company\nexpects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will\nimpact the Company’s sales of STELARA.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier\nin the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally\nfor advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other\njurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable\nenvironmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a\nmaterial effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations, and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various\nfederal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and\nsafety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA)\ncontinues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new\ndrugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also\nevident in major markets outside of the U.S.\n2024 Annual Report3\nThe medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security\nlaws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Within the U.S., an increasing\nnumber of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws, and federal regulators (e.g., the U.S. FDA, FTC and\nHHS) continue to stress the intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority. In the EU,\nmultiple directives and laws (including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the AI Act) are\nrapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In\naddition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations, with more\nanticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer practices. With other\njurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on\nthe collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict transfers\nof data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed\nglobally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced\nregulation to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of AI is underway that includes standards for\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require compliance developments or enhancements.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has\nbeen required or directed to.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our\npharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable safety risk, the U.S. FDA\ncould ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement,\nor refund of such products, withdraw approval for such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing\nauthorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health\nprofessionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The\nU.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating\nrestrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of\napplicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse\nregulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products\nand limit our ability to obtain future clearances, classifications or approvals, and could result in a substantial\nmodification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different\ncountries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare\ngenerally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships\nbetween healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations\nrequire disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including\nphysicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing\ninternational business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions\nwith respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a\npotent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare\ncost and access in the U.S.\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\nInflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish\nprices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in\n2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) published the first “Selected Drug” list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as\nIMBRUVICA, which is developed in collaboration and co-commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie\ncompany. The Selected Drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the\nMedicare population. Although CMS published an explanation for how it determined prices for selected drugs in\nDecember 2024, uncertainty remains as to the methodology used to determine these prices. The IRA specifies a\nceiling price but not a minimum price for selected drugs and does not require CMS to use a specific framework for\ndetermining selected drug prices. In any event, we anticipate that the selected products will be subjected to a\ngovernment-established price for the Medicare population beginning in 2026.\n4\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of\ninflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs.\nSeparate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nIRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates\nJanssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen\nis not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies\nremains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs,\nimplementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of\nits summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies,\nand other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to\nincrease pricing transparency and controls.\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that\nwould affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both\npositive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various\nprovisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions\nfor our products.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied\non companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In\nthe U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant\nsettlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure\nof personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection\nand use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nand subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in\nthe Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\n2024 Annual Report5\nEmployees and human capital management\nAs of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the number of employees was approximately:\n2024             2023\nEmployees(1)                               139,800          134,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions(2)    138,100          131,900\n(1) “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded. Shockwave has been included in the fiscal 2024 headcount in the above table.\n(2) FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nEmployees by region (in percentages)\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting top talent\nDeveloping and retaining top talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on innovation, health,\nwell-being and safety, inclusion and belonging where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both\nprofessionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and employee engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo, which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\nworldwide must adhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct, which sets fundamental requirements and serves as\na foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on\nexpected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its\nemployees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and\nidentify opportunities to improve. In 2024, 94% of global employees across 73 countries participated in Our Credo\nSurvey which was offered in 36 languages.\n6\nGrowth and development\nTo lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top\ntalent. In 2024, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 6.3%. The Company believes that its employees must be\nequipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their\ncareers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources are available to all employees.\nThe Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while\ncreating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this\nobjective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they\nare on their career journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's second Global\nLearning Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses on J&J Learn, the\nnew state-of-the-art learning platform.\nOur workforce\nAs stated in Our Credo, we are responsible to our employees who work with us throughout the world. The Company is\ncommitted to cultivating, fostering and advancing an inclusive, credo-based work environment for employees that\nrecognizes and rewards based on merit. The Company is dedicated to the values in Our Credo and strives to meet the\nneeds of its employees and stakeholders through compliance with law and the following evidence based strategies:\nSustain a global workforce of individuals with many different backgrounds, abilities, cultures and perspectives\nMaintain a work environment where each person’s dignity is respected and they have an opportunity to advance\nbased on their merit\nDrive innovation and growth with our business to serve markets around the world\nOur approach with respect to our workforce is guided by applicable laws, internal and external insights, global\nbest practices and employee feedback.\nCompensation and benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fair treatment in its compensation and benefits for\nemployees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The\nCompany's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being, including\nannual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits,\npaid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.\nHealth, wellness and safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company works to ensure that all its employees around the world, as well as contingent workers,\ncontractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and\nwell-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to\nkeep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and\npractices the Company provides—physical, mental, emotional and financial—help promote holistic employee health. The\nCompany continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the Company’s\noffice-based employees to find a balance of in-person and remote work, while preserving the Company's culture and\nneed for face-to-face engagement and leadership.\n2024 Annual Report7\nAvailable information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks related to our business, industry and operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development. The Company may also experience\noperational and financial risk in connection with acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks\nand liabilities associated with acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees,\nand successfully identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition-related\nstrain on our management, operations and financial resources.\nFor the Company’s Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic, biosimilar and other competing\nproducts and enter the market. For the Company’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality,\nreputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new\nor improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less\ndesirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are\nunable to introduce new products or technological advances that are safe, more effective, more effectively marketed\nor otherwise outperform those of our competitors.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 64 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, lack of available inspectors, political unrest, terrorist attacks\nand epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines\nin sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing\nthe shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a\nthird-party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component parts and\nproducts. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity\nsufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and\nto deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these\nthird-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could\nresult in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\n2024 Annual Report9\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need\nto seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased\ncosts which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises). The spread of health crises have caused and may cause the Company\nto modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the\nCompany determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners under such\ncircumstances. Impacts to the Company have included and may include adverse impacts to results of operations and\nfinancial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. While\nthe Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network designed to help\nmitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely\naffected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including,\namong other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and\nclinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results,\nand global economic conditions generally.\nRisks related to government regulation and legal proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird-party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\nscrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has changed Medicare Part D benefit design and has subjected certain of the\nCompany's products to government-established pricing beginning in 2026 and may subject additional products in the\nfuture. Failure to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law pending ongoing litigation may expose the\nCompany to penalties. In addition, change to Medicare Part D could have a negative impact on U.S. Innovative\nMedicine sales. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded\ninterpretations of the statute and program abuse may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance.\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive\ngovernment involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls,\nlimit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property\nprotection.\n10\nWe are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the countries in which\noperations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and business\noperations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive government laws and\nregulations, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other\ncountries in which it operates. For example, changes to the U.S. FDA’s timing or requirements for approval or\nclearance of our products may have a negative impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New and\nchanging laws, regulations, executive orders and other directives may also impose deadlines on the Company, or its\nthird-party suppliers, manufacturers or other partners and providers, for which there may be insufficient time to\nimplement changes to comply with such new regulations and may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain\nconstraints. If the Company is unable to identify ways to mitigate these delays or constraints, there may be an\nadverse effect on sales and access to our products.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible\nto predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has been and could in the future be required to pay\nsignificant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals,\nincluding matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The\nresolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not\npurchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance\ncompany subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nProduct concerns, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not\nbased on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory\naction on the part of the U.S. FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of\nfines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to\nbrand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could\nin the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities,\ncontinued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage,\npossible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nThe rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the Company and a\nfailure of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may expose the Company to\ninvestigations, legal actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing\nPractices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices\ncan lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new\nproduct approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are\nsubject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\nthe Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer\nprotection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys\ngeneral in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and\ncriminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs.\nAny such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The\nmost significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19\nLegal proceedings—Government proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n2024 Annual Report11\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the enactment by certain EU and non-EU countries, and the anticipated\nenactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax\nrate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any\ncountry would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that\nparticular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense\nor benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these\nproposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any\ntime, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law\nchange is enacted.\nSee Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for\nadditional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and the inability of the\nCompany to secure and maintain these rights may have a detrimental impact on the Company’s financial results.\nPublic policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property\nrights. The Company cannot be certain that it will secure and maintain adequate patent protection for new products\nand technologies in the United States and other important markets.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, others may claim the Company has infringed their intellectual\nproperty rights, including copyrights, patents, or trademarks, and/or has misappropriated their trade secrets, any\nof which could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of our products.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such\nchallenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a\nmajor portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings\ninvolving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19 Legal\nproceedings—Intellectual property under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n12\nRisks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation, development and implementation of new products,\ntechnologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2024 sales. The Company cannot be certain\nwhen or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies,\nwhether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products\nwill be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. Moreover, the development and\nregulatory approval of new products may be delayed due to limits on federal agency budgets or personnel, including\nreductions to the U.S. FDA’s budget, employees, and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer\nreview periods. After approval, new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or\nsignificantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or\nhealthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.\nEven following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and\nefficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\nThe Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging technologies\nacross varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and incorporation of AI may result in\nunintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. AI technology is continuously evolving, and\nthe AI technologies we develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these\ntechnologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive\nadvantage. The application of AI in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations that\nmay entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these technologies. These\ntechnologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described below.\nRisks related to financial and economic market conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally.\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign currency exchange : In fiscal 2024, approximately 43% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 23% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 15% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in\nArgentina, Turkey, Venezuela and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins\nin these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might\nexperience operating losses as a result of continued inflation.\n2024 Annual Report13\nIn addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant\ncurrency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal importation of pharmaceutical products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-bribery and other regulations : The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including\nthe U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement\nactivities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and\nactions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including\nexclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther financial, economic, legal, social and political risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased antitrust\nreporting requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nDue to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, including\nglobal tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world. Global\ntensions, conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or distribute our products\nmay result in foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in affected countries, and challenges\nto our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers.\nMost recently, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business\nresulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, rising conflict in the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between\nthe U.S. and China. In response to heightened conflict, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose\nexport controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and operations may be further impacted by\nthe imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country that favor domestic\ncompanies and technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the\nglobal community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents,\ntrademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be\ntaken that allows companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States\nand many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from\npracticing the Company's inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia. In\naddition, the U.S. government recently announced tariffs on products manufactured in several jurisdictions,\nincluding China, Mexico and Canada, and has\n14\nmade announcements regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on other jurisdictions. While certain of the\nannounced tariffs have been delayed, the U.S. government may in the future pause, reimpose or increase tariffs, and\ncountries subject to such tariffs have and in the future may impose reciprocal tariffs or other restrictive trade\nmeasures in response. Any of these actions could increase uncertainties and associated risks relating to the\nCompany’s global operations.\nWeak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the financial\nmarkets could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nOther risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented and highly skilled employees.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing many different backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a credo-based work\nenvironment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot\nretain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services\nmay be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any\nunsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth\ntransitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data (including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection) to ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain and operations, and as part of many of the\nproducts we deliver to customers. The extensive range of information security and cybersecurity threats, which\naffect companies globally, pose a persistent risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks,\nincluding to customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and networks, and the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company assesses these threats, responds to\nattacks and breaches that it has experienced, and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and\nresponse capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and\n2024 Annual Report15\ncontrols, to address this risk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased\nvolume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This\nimpact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and\nregulatory action. Also, increasing use of AI could increase these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity\ninsurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to\ncover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.\nAs a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased risk of\ninformation security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by adversaries of countries\nwhere the Company maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication of these attacks, the Company may not be\nable to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly,\nor at all, which could adversely affect customers that use our products, our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition. Moreover, these threats could also impact our third-party partners resulting in compromise of\nthe Company's IT systems, networks and data which could negatively affect the Company.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact on\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations across the globe that impose broad\ncompliance obligations on the collection, possession, use, storage, access, disclosure, transfer, deletion and\nprotection of personal data. Breach of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in substantial\nfines, penalties, governmental actions, private right of actions, including class actions, and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected globally, together with greater privacy enforcement by\ngovernmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and data transfers including\ninternational data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls with which our\nbusinesses worldwide are required to comply. However, with many technology and data-driven initiatives evolving\nacross the Company, involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are threats that could impact our business\noperations and research activities, including potential risks of unauthorized access and loss of personal data as\nwell as legislative actions imposing limitations and controls on the use and sharing of personal data as well as on\ncross border data flows.\n16"

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nThe Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, and\nmonitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the Company’s information systems from\ncybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools supporting protection, detection, and response\ncapabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent\nresponse to actual or attempted cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.\nThe Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the Company's use of\nthird-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and supply chain through a\nstructured third-party risk management program.\nThe Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes training on\nmatters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory\ntraining on data privacy.\nTo evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party experts to\nundertake maturity assessments of the Company’s information security program.\nTo date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business or operations; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely impacted.This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other\nbusiness harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.

The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a member of the Company’s\nExecutive Committee, and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)are responsible for assessing and managing\ncybersecurity risks, including security incident detection, response, and recovery.\nThe Company’s CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company’s cybersecurity program\nand management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five years of experience in information\nsecurity, and his background includes technical experience, strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and\nthreat experience, and various leadership roles.\nGovernance - board oversight\nThe Company’s Board of Directorsoversees the overall risk management process, including cybersecurity risks,\ndirectly and through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee (RCSC) of the board is\nprimarily responsible for oversight of risk from cybersecurity threats and oversees compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and Company policies related to, among others, privacy and cybersecurity.\nRCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others, those\nrelating to cybersecurity. The CISO provides quarterly updates each year to RCSC on cybersecurity matters. These\nreports include an overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key cybersecurity initiatives to improve the\nCompany’s risk posture, changes in the legal and regulatory landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of\ncertain cybersecurity incidents that have occurred within the Company and within the industry.\n2024 Annual Report17"

The decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales was driven by share loss primarily due to European biosimilar\nentrants. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) was due to continued biosimilar competition. The growth of TREMFYA\n(guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024.

Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nInfectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2024, a decline of 23.1% as compared to the prior year\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue.\nNeuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 0.4% as compared to the prior\nyear primarily driven by a decline in Other Neuroscience. The decline was partially offset by the growth of\nSPRAVATO (esketamine) driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand.\nOncology products achieved sales of $20.8 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 17.7% as compared to the\nprior year. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains and market growth. Growth\nof ERLEADA (apalutamide) was primarily due to continued share gains and market growth. Sales of CARVYKTI\n(ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing\nefficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-\ntgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially\noffset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global\ncompetitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 12.3% as compared to the prior\nyear. Sales growth of both OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth and share\ngains. Growth in Other Pulmonary Hypertension was driven by OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil).\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.6 billion, a decline of 3.0% as compared to the prior year\ndriven by declines in Other.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location.

The debt balance at the end of 2024 was $36.6 billion as compared to $29.3 billion in 2023.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $6.7 billion. For\nadditional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this\noffering were used to fund the Shockwave acquisition which closed on May 31, 2024, and for general corporate\npurposes. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity\nprofile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows,\nthe ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and\naccess to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,\nincluding the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately\n$1.5 billion and the approximately $11.6 billion ($13.5 billion nominal) reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital\nmarkets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444\nshares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of\n$22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book\nvalue of the Johnson & Johnson\n34\ndivested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO,\nJohnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2,\n2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to\nnon-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common\nStock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson\ncommon stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the\nCompany owned 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within\ncontinuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the\ndeconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net\nearnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third\nquarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson\n& Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $3.6\nbillion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a\nDebt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial\nPaper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the\nCompany no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $0.4\nbillion recorded in Other (income) expense.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nDecember 29, 2024: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\n(Dollars in Millions)    Tax Legislation    Debt Obligations         Interest on     Total\n(TCJA)                        Debt Obligations\n2025                              $2,536               1,749               1,075     5,360\n2026                                   —               1,999               1,030     3,029\n2027                                   —               2,385               1,021     3,406\n2028                                   —               2,275                 977     3,252\n2029                                   —               1,444                 922     2,366\nAfter 2029                             —              22,548               8,921    31,469\nTotal                             $2,536              32,400              13,946    48,882\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the proposed talc settlement payments,\nsee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Annual Report35\nFinancing and market risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December\n29, 2024 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. In\neither scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.5 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $8.0 million.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In June 2024, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on June 25, 2025. Interest charged on\nborrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference\nRate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are\nnot material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $36.6 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The increase in\nthe borrowings was due to the issuance of new debt in 2024. In 2024, net debt (cash and current marketable\nsecurities, net of debt) was $12.1 billion compared to net debt of $6.4 billion in 2023. Total debt represented\n34.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2024 and 30.0% of total capital in 2023.\nShareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2024 was $29.70 compared to $28.57 at year-end 2023.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2024 for the 62 nd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.91 per share\nin 2024 and $4.70 per share in 2023.\nOn January 2, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on March 4,\n2025 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2025.\n36\nOther information\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts\nare estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected\nmarket conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of\nproducts primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data,\nas well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost\npatent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other\nmarketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company\ngenerally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in\naccordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves\nare recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not\nresalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2024,\n2023 and 2022.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales\nvolumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to\ndetermine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns\nprofit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to\ncustomers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to\ncustomers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n2024 Annual Report37\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nInnovative Medicine segment\nBalance at                         Payments/              Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning              Accruals    Credits(2)             End of\nof Period                                                 Period\n2024\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $14,661      52,786                -51,667                15,780\nAccrued returns                                  634         845                   -355                 1,124\nAccrued promotions                                 6           3                     -6                     3\nSubtotal                                     $15,301      53,634                -52,028                16,907\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     33          14                     -6                    41\nReserve for cash discounts                       111       1,493                 -1,495                   109\nTotal                                        $15,445      55,141                -53,529                17,057\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $12,289      47,523                -45,151                14,661\nAccrued returns                                  649         332                   -347                   634\nAccrued promotions                                 1          12                     -7                     6\nSubtotal                                     $12,939      47,867                -45,505                15,301\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     44           0                    -11                    33\nReserve for cash discounts                       110       1,386                 -1,385                   111\nTotal                                        $13,093      49,253                -46,901                15,445\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $187 million at December 29, 2024 and $165 million at December 31,\n2023, recorded as a contra asset.\n(2) Includes prior period adjustments\n38\nMedTech segment\nBalance at                Payments/    Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning of    Accruals      Credits        End of\nPeriod                                 Period\n2024\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,455       5,955       -5,986         1,424\nAccrued returns                           125         543         -550           118\nAccrued promotions                         25          62          -65            22\nSubtotal                               $1,605       6,560       -6,601         1,564\nReserve for doubtful accounts             133          31          -38           126\nReserve for cash discounts                  5          92          -91             6\nTotal                                  $1,743       6,683       -6,730         1,696\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,470       6,241       -6,256         1,455\nAccrued returns                           134         555         -564           125\nAccrued promotions                         43          74          -92            25\nSubtotal                               $1,647       6,870       -6,912         1,605\nReserve for doubtful accounts             125          33          -25           133\nReserve for cash discounts                  9          96         -100             5\nTotal                                  $1,781       6,999       -7,037         1,743\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $704 million at December 29, 2024 and $740 million at December 31,\n2023, recorded as a contra asset.\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n2024 Annual Report39\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for\nthe two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on\nthe date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends,\nwhich are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 29, 2024.\n40\nEconomic and market factors\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2014 - 2024, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly\ninflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact\nto the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit\nmargins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nIRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates\nJanssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen\nis not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies\nremains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs,\nimplementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of\nits summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was\nnot material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business\nof the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues.\nThe Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was\nnot material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business\nof the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than\n1% of revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2024 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.1\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\n2024 Annual Report41\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which\na loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments\nabout future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 6, 2025,\nthere were 114,147 record holders of Common Stock of the Company."

Summary of significant accounting policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the company\nThe Company has approximately 138,100employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nKenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of\n198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an initial public\noffering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the\nnet book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $ 2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in\ncapital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares\nof Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the\nnon-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-\ncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second quarter of 2023.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of the shares of\nKenvue through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the shares of Kenvue\nwhich were accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within continuing operations. The historical\nresults of the Consumer Health business (which previously represented the Consumer Health business segment) are\nreflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the\nexchange offer (see Note 21 for additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements refer only to Johnson & Johnson’s continuing operations.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024 the Company completed a debt for equity exchange of the retained stake in\nKenvue. Upon completion of the debt for equity exchange, the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common\nStock.\nBusiness segments\nThe Company is organized into twobusiness segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine\nsegment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology, Infectious Diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic. Products in this segment are distributed directly to\nretailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech\nsegment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Cardiovascular (previously\nreferred to as Interventional Solutions) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,\nhospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nNew accounting standards\nRecently adopted accounting standards\nASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe Company adopted the standard in the fiscal year 2024, which requires expanded annual and interim disclosures\nfor significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included\nwithin each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard was applied retrospectively to all periods\npresented in the financial statements. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it did not have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 17 for the required disclosures.\n50\nRecently issued accounting standards\nNot adopted as of December 29, 2024\nASU 2024-03: Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic\n220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nThis update requires disclosure of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on\nan annual and interim basis. This update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. As this\naccounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThis update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires disaggregation of income\ntaxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required to be effective for the Company for\nfiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they\nare classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and\nequity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The\nCompany reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as\nrequired.\nProperty, plant and equipment and depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment    30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\n2024 Annual Report51\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30to 90days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates,\nreturns, and promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts\nare estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected\nmarket conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from\nthe sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and\nMedicaid programs, which amounted to $ 12.3billion and $ 11.5billion as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the\nanalysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated\ninformation.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost\npatent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other\nmarketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company\ngenerally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in\naccordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves\nare recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not\nresalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude\nvolume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for\nthe incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the\nappropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share\npayments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-\nshare payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less\nthan 3.0% of total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 0.9billion, $ 0.9billion and $ 0.8billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n52\nIntangible assets and goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2024 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nIn-process research and development purchased as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite\nlived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be\naccounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development\ncould be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operations was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lease liability from continuing operations was $ 1.2billion and $\n1.1billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The operating lease costs from continuing operations were $\n0.2billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n2024 Annual Report53\nProduct liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense other than the acquired in-process research & development expense of\n$ 1.25billion to secure the global rights to the NM26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition) in fiscal\nyear 2024.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG, IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and CARVYKTI, licensed and developed in collaboration with Legend Biotech USA\nInc. and Legend Biotech Ireland Limited.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\n54\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 0.6billion, $ 0.5billion and $ 0.7billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in fiscal year 2018 and\nwill continue through 2025. The final payment of $ 2.5billion will be made in fiscal year 2025.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to affect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\n2024 Annual Report55\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nSupplier finance program obligations\nThe Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs\nprovide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment\ndates (which have general payment terms of 90days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to\nparticipate in the program.\nConfirmed obligations under the program as of December 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $ 0.8billion and $\n0.7billion, respectively. The obligations are presented as Accounts payableon the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe rollforward of the Company's valid obligations under the program were as follows:\n2024\n(Dollars in Millions)\nConfirmed obligations - beginning of the year     $704\nInvoices confirmed during the year               3,048\nConfirmed invoices paid during the year          2,964\nConfirmed obligations - end of the year           $788\nAnnual closing date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\n56\n2.

Fair value measurements\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows,\nprimarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of\nmaterials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company\nunder the CSA amounted to $ 2.2billion and $ 4.0billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow\nhedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-\nperformance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that\nhave at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions.\nAs of December 29, 2024, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross\ncurrency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 45.1billion, $ 40.5billion and $ 9.0billion,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $\n10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. Cash exchanged\nfor derivatives is primarily in cash flows from operating activities.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2044 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of December 29, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income was $ 1.7billion after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward\nforeign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions\nthat are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging\ntransaction exposure is 18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount\nultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are\nultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\n60\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for

There were impacts of $ 26million and $ 27million, respectively, of\nchanges in the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of\ninvestments.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n2024 Annual Report63\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended\nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts(2)\nTotal\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts(2)\nTotal                                                 Level 1    Level 2    Level 3    Total\nDerivatives not designated as hedging                 $—         660              —      660                539\ninstruments:                                          —          1,484            —    1,484                988\nAssets:                                               $—         2,144            —    2,144              1,527\nForward foreign exchange contracts                    —          794              —      794                624\nLiabilities:                                          —          3,753            —    3,753              5,338\nForward foreign exchange contracts                    $—         4,547            —    4,547              5,962\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:                 $—         50               —       50                 64\nEquity investments(3)                                 —          17               —       17                 75\nDebt securities(4)                                    451        —                —      451    2023      4,473\nOther Liabilities                               2024  —          7,216            —    7,216    Total(1)  8,874\nContingent Consideration(5)                           $                       1,217    1,217              1,092\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation      2024      2023\n(Dollars in Millions)\nTotal Gross Assets                        $2,194     1,591\nCredit Support Agreements (CSA)           -2,172    -1,575\nTotal Net Asset                               22        16\nTotal Gross Liabilities                    4,564     6,037\nCredit Support Agreements (CSA)           -4,412    -5,604\nTotal Net Liabilities                       $152       433\n64\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n2024     2023     2022\n(Dollars in Millions)\nBeginning Balance                  $1,092    1,120      533\nChanges in estimated fair value        88       29     -194\nAdditions(6)                          112        —      792\nPayments/Other                        -75      -57      -11\nEnding Balance(5)                  $1,217    1,092    1,120\n(1) 2023 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n4,473million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 1,092million, classified as Level\n3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 1,217million, $ 1,092million and $ 1,116million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of\nDecember 29, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively.

Both\ncharges were recorded at an effective U.S. tax rate of approximately 21% (for further information see Note 19 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAdditionally in the fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by legislative changes that\nwent into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions which are reflected in International\noperations on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Also in fiscal year 2024, the Company generated\nincremental U.S. foreign tax credits related to income sourced and taxed outside the United States and is reflected\nin U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. In 2024, the Company\nfinalized multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and certain other\nforeign jurisdictions. The U.S portion of the agreements were partially offset by the related tax adjustments in\nthe foreign jurisdictions which are reflected in U.S tax settlements and International operations, respectively, on\nthe Company’s effective rate reconciliation.\nThe fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate decreased 3.9% as compared to the fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate as\nthe Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2023 when compared to the prior\nfiscal year.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company settled the U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years\n2013 through 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to the rate of 3.0%. This settlement was partially offset by\nthe Company recording a $ 0.4billion decrease in expected U.S. foreign tax credits, an unfavorable effective rate\nimpact of 2.6%, which has been reflected as a current tax expense in U.S. taxes on international income on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company had certain non-recurring impacts as a result of legislative tax elections\nmade in certain international subsidiaries which resulted in a change in the Company’s tax basis in certain assets\nresulting in deferred tax re-measurements. The net impact of these non-recurring items is a net benefit of 3.4% to\nthe Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion of tax benefit on local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the\nincreased tax basis, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation. This benefit was offset by approximately $ 0.1billion of U.S. deferred tax expense on the\nGILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected\nin the “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n68\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax related to an election made by\nan international subsidiary resulting in a decrease in local deferred tax assets. This has been reflected in the\nU.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company also had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions vs. fiscal year 2022, primarily in the U.S. where the\nCompany recorded an approximately $ 7.0billion charge related to talc matters in the United States at an effective\ntax rate of 21.1% (for further information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n2024 Deferred Tax                         2023 Deferred Tax\n(Dollars in Millions)                              Asset    Liability                        Asset    Liability\nEmployee related                                    $372                                       586\nobligations\nStock based compensation                             717                                       686\nDepreciation of property,\nplant and                                                        -833                                      -902\nequipment\nGoodwill and intangibles                                       -3,261                                    -1,252\nR&D capitalized for tax                            4,398                                     3,595\nReserves & liabilities                             4,444                                     3,816\nInventory related                                    371                                       359\nOperating loss                                     2,298                                     2,145\ncarryforwards\nUndistributed foreign                              1,931       -1,492                        1,801       -1,695\nearnings\nGlobal intangible low-taxed                                    -1,589                                    -2,731\nincome\nMiscellaneous international                        1,212                                       831\nMiscellaneous U.S.                                 1,083                                                     -4\nTotal deferred income taxes                       16,826       -7,175                       13,819       -6,584\nValuation allowances                              -1,638                                    -1,149\nTotal deferred income taxes\nnet of                                            15,188       -7,175                       12,670       -6,584\nvaluation allowances\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that\nit is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to partially\nutilize these deferred tax assets. In certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against\ndeferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. The net operating loss\ncarryforwards for these international subsidiaries that do not have an indefinite carryforward period will begin to\nexpire in 2025 for various amounts.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to valuation allowances for continuing operations:\n(Dollars in Millions)             2024      2023\nBeginning of year               $1,149       775\nProvision                          451       355\nUtilization                          —      -116\nForeign currency translation       -46        25\nNet acquisitions /                  84       110\n(dispositions/liquidations)\nEnd of year                     $1,638    $1,149\n2024 Annual Report69\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations:\n(Dollars in Millions)                      2024     2023     2022\nBeginning of year                        $2,485    3,716    3,210\nIncreases related to current year tax       176      239      523\npositions\nIncreases related to prior period tax       129      244      143\npositions\nDecreases related to prior period tax      -147     -781     -148\npositions\nSettlements                                -583     -880       -1\nLapse of statute of limitations             -40      -53      -11\nEnd of year                              $2,020    2,485    3,716\nAs of December 29, 2024 the Company had approximately $ 2.0billion of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company\nconducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a\nnumber of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2016 and has commenced the audit for tax years 2017 through 2020. The Company\nrecently finalized multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the IRS and certain other foreign jurisdictions in\nthe fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve\nmonths by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions. The Company anticipates a change in uncertain tax positions of\napproximately $ 200million in certain jurisdictions in the next twelve months due to the expected expiration of the\nstatute of limitations. However, generally the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the\ntiming of any other future tax payments, audit settlements, or changes in uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax\nexpense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 217million, $ 99million and $ 136million in fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 274million and $ 264million in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n9.

Pensions and other benefit plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S., non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2024 and 2023 the Company used December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2024,\n2023 and 2022 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans                                Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in                               2024      2023      2022                         2024    2023    2022\nMillions)\nService cost                              $948       893     1,319                          277     264     320\nInterest cost                            1,402     1,437       908                          209     214     104\nExpected return on                      -2,560    -2,716    -2,756                           -7      -7      -8\nplan assets\nAmortization of                           -184      -184      -184                           -2      -2      -5\nprior service cost\nRecognized\nactuarial losses                           174      -199       650                           53      23     122\n(gains)\nCurtailments and                            -2        93         1                            —      -5       —\nsettlements\nNet periodic\nbenefit cost                            $(222)      -676       -62                          530     487     533\n(credit)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue. All other components of net periodic\nbenefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with\nthe exception of certain amounts for curtailments and settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue (as noted above).\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\n2024 Annual Report71\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement                                             Other\nPlans                                           Benefit\nPlans\nWorldwide\nBenefit                      2024          2023          2022                  2024          2023          2022\nPlans\nNet\nPeriodic\nBenefit\nCost\nService\ncost                   4.39     %    4.85          2.46                  5.09          5.40          2.59\ndiscount\nrate\nInterest\ncost                   4.95     %    5.25          2.80                  5.12          5.43          2.64\ndiscount\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.70     %    3.71          4.02                  4.22          4.22          4.21\ncompensati…\nlevels\nExpected\nlong-term\nrate of                7.25     %    7.21          7.25\nreturn on\nplan assets\nBenefit\nObligation\nDiscount               4.95     %    4.58          5.01                  5.54          5.11          5.42\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.70     %    3.69          4.00                  4.22          4.22          4.21\ncompensati…\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets\nin the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\nOther assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are\nvalued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded\nare classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\n2024 Annual Report75\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nQuo…\nPri…                                                              Inv…\nin                  Sig…                  Sig…                  Mea…\nAct…                  Oth…                  Uno…                  at\nMar…                  Obs…                  Inp…                  Net\nfor                  Inp…                                        Ass…\nIde…                                                              Val…\nAss…\n-Le…                  -Le…                  -Le…                                        To…\n1                  2                     3                                           As…\n(D…\nin           2024    2023          2024    2023          2024    2023          2024    2023         2024    20…\nMi…\nSh…\nin…      $—            12           511     829             —       —             —       —          511    841\nfu…\nGo…\nand             —       —          7,8…    5,9…             —       —             —       —         7,8…    5,…\nag…\nse…\nDe…             —       —          2,3…    3,8…             —       —             —       —         2,3…    3,…\nin…\nEq…          7,1…    7,7…             —       —             —       —             —       —         7,1…    7,…\nse…\nCo…             —       —          5,0…    4,9…            37      43          6,1…    6,6…         11,…    11…\nfu…\nOt…             —       —            88      49           128      92          4,0…    3,2…         4,3…    3,…\nas…\nIn…\nat     $7,…          7,7…          15,…    15,…           165     135          10,…    9,9…         33,…    33…\nfa…\nva…\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 93million and $\n86million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 13million at December 31, 2024\nand $ 14million at December 31, 2023.\n11.

International currency translation\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the\nlocal currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly\ninflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or\nmore during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.\nFor the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies (Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela). Beginning in the\nfiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also accounted for operations in Egypt as highly inflationary. The\ntranslation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 214million, $\n366million and $ 286million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n78\n15.

Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements\nAt December 29, 2024, the Company had oneactive stock-based compensation plan, the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nThe shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted\nshares units and performance share units) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive\nPlan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of\nwhich up to 110million shares of common stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights\nand up to 40million shares of common stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be\ncounted on a 1-for-1 basis against the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are\ngranted, each full value award in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve.\nShares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 111million at the end of fiscal\nyear 2024.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,176million, $ 1,087million and $\n1,028million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 251million, $ 221million and $ 177million for fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 94million,\n$ 126million and $ 267million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for which options were exercised\nor restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 1,002million, $ 907million and $\n866million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be\nrecognized was 1.81years, 1.80years and 1.80years for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Share-based\ncompensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\n2024 Annual Report79\nStock options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. Options granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the average of the high and low\nprices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Options granted under the\n2022 Long-Term incentive Plan were granted at the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock\nExchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2024, 2023, and 2022 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe average fair value of options granted was $ 27.67, $ 27.85and $ 23.23, in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:\n2024           2023           2022\nRisk-free rate               4.15     %     3.74     %     1.98     %\nExpected volatility         17.85     %    17.69     %    18.00     %\nExpected life (in years)            7.0            7.0            7.0\nExpected dividend yield      3.10     %     2.90     %     2.70     %\nA summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 29, 2024, is presented below:\nWeighted                Aggregate\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding    Average Exercise                Intrinsic\nShares               Price                    Value\n(Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 31, 2023        112,238             $139.88                   $2,239\nOptions granted                     13,917              157.92\nOptions exercised                  -10,771              107.06\nOptions canceled/forfeited          -2,755              162.45\nShares at December 29, 2024        112,629             $144.69                   $1,129\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 560million, $ 729million and $ 1,228million in fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n80\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 29, 2024:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                  Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise                    Options    Average                   Average                 Options        Average\nPrice Range                            Life(1)                  Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$100.06-                     13,016                  0.8         $101.29                  13,016        $101.29\n$101.87\n$115.67-                     18,252                  2.6          122.49                  18,252         122.49\n$129.51\n$131.94-                     25,624                  4.6          142.87                  25,624         142.87\n$151.41\n$157.92-                     26,391                  8.6          160.33                   4,269         162.75\n$162.75\n$164.62-                     29,346                  6.6          165.29                  13,522         164.64\n$165.89\n112,629                  5.3         $144.69                  74,683        $135.72\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 were 112,238and an average life of 5.5years and\n118,672and an average life of 5.8years, respectively.

(Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and\ncommercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $ 132.00per share in cash for a\ntotal equity value of approximately $ 14.6billion. The Company expects to fund the transaction through a\ncombination of cash on hand and debt. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject\nto applicable regulatory approvals, approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies’ stockholders and other customary closing\nconditions for a transaction of this type. The results of operations will be included in the Innovative Medicine\nsegment beginning on the acquisition date.\nBusiness combinations\nAcquisitions of a business are accounted for as business combinations applying the acquisition method of\naccounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair\nvalues as of the acquisition date in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of\noperations of these acquisitions have been included in the Company’s financial statements from their respective\ndates of acquisition.\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, certain businesses were acquired for $ 15.1billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal\nyear 2024 acquisitions primarily included; Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., Shockwave Medical Inc., and Proteologix, Inc. The\nremaining acquisitions were not material.\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology\ncompany focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for approximately $ 0.8billion net of cash\nacquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The results of operations are included in the\nInnovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets\nacquired of $ 1.2billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $\n0.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion, and $ 0.3billion of liabilities assumed which included $ 0.1billion related\nto a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation\nadjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the\nfair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied\nwas approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business\nacquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the\nfiscal 2024 were notmaterial.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV)(Shockwave), a leading,\nfirst-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in an all-cash merger transaction.

The\namortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market CAD and PAD IVL products with the\naverage weighted lives of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products.\nThe value of the IPR&D was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection discounted for the risk\ninherent in such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of approximately 50%. The\ndiscount rate applied was 9.0%.\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-\ngeneration antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of\napproximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired.

A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to\n2024 Annual Report91\n70% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The\ndiscount rate applied was approximately 17%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise\nfrom the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs\nbefore tax for the fiscal year 2024 were not material.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal\nyear 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not material.\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\nthe Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\nrecovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The results of operations were included in the MedTech\nsegment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding\nshares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash,\namounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”)\nentitling the holder to receive up to $ 35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately\n$ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding\nenterprise value (without taking into account the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities acquired.\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\na. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson & Johnson’s\nfiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this\nperiod and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;\nb. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in ST-elevated\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\nc. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella® products\nin high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical\nendpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In fiscal 2023,\nthere were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $ 0.2billion with an offsetting increase\nto goodwill.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio\nand is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other\nLiabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2024 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella® platform\nwith an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved\nproducts. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the\nrisk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied\nwas 9.5%.\nIn the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately\n$ 0.3billion, $ 0.2billion and $ 0.3billion, which was primarily recorded in Other (income)/expense.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\n92\nAsset acquisitions\nAcquired In-process research and development (IPR&D) in an asset acquisition is immediately expensed as research\nand development expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Milestone payments incurred prior to\nregulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense when the milestone event occurs.\nThe fiscal year 2024 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included V-Wave Ltd. and the global\nrights to the NM26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition). The remaining activity was not material.\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of V-Wave Ltd, a privately-held company focused on\ndeveloping innovative treatment options for patients with heart failure, for an upfront payment of $ 0.6billion,\nwith the potential for additional regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to approximately $ 1.1billion.\nThe Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $ 0.5billion, net of a gain recorded on the Company's\nexisting investment in V-Wave and the results of operations are included in the MedTech segment as of the\nacquisition date.\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Yellow Jersey, a demerged subsidiary of Numab\nTherapeutics AG, to secure the global rights to NM26, a novel, investigational first-in-class bispecific antibody\ntargeting two clinically proven pathways in atopic dermatitis (AD), in an all-cash transaction for approximately $\n1.25billion. The Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $ 1.25billion, and the results of operations are\nincluded in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.\nThe fiscal year 2023 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included Laminar Inc. The remaining\nactivity was not material.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Laminar Inc., a privately-held medical device\ncompany focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation\n(AFib), for an upfront payment of $ 0.4billion. The Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $ 0.4billion\nand the results of operations are included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date.\nThere were no significant asset acquisitions in 2022.\nDivestitures\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Acclarent resulting in approximately $\n0.3billion in proceeds and the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion\nin proceeds. All other divestitures were not material.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds\nresulting in gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily\nintangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $ 0.3billion, primarily related to Acclarent and\nPonvory, that were subsequently divested in fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did notmake any material divestitures.\n19. Legal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of\n2024 Annual Report93\npotential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and\ncounterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the\nCompany and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the\nMississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’\nuse of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The\nCompany has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its\ntalcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group\nof state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements\nwere finalized.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL\nBankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in\nMarch 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\n94\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court\novarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted\nto proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023,\nthe court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-\nprecedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy case.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In\nDecember 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (\"LLT\").\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL,\ncase-specific discovery proceeded. The MDL proceedings have been stayed by order of the bankruptcy court in the Red\nRiver Bankruptcy case discussed below. In March 2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert\nhearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.\nIn May 2024, the Company commenced a three-monthsolicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nChapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and\nfuture claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State\nconsumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $\n6.475billion payable over 25years (nominal value of approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The\nclaims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its\ntalc powder products.\nIn August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability\ncompanies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (\"Red River\"); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (\"Pecos River\"); and (3) New Holdco\n(Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were\nseparated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated\nto Pecos River.\nIn September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red\nRiver filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas,\nseeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the\nCompany's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,\nseeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities. Prior to filing, the initial proposed plan\nwas amended to, among other things, increase the proposed resolution by $ 1.75billion.\n2024 Annual Report95\nShortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to transfer venue\nin the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas\nBankruptcy Court. A coalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a motion to transfer venue and a motion to\ndismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. In September 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order\nenjoining the commencement or prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities,\nincluding the Company, until October 11, 2024. The temporary order was extended in October 2024 and again in\nDecember 2024. The commencement and prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities are\ncurrently enjoined until March 15, 2025. Also in September 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the U.S.\nTrustee's motion to transfer venue without prejudice. In October 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court denied the motion\nto transfer venue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court. A consolidated hearing to address, among other things,\nthe motions to dismiss and plan confirmation is currently scheduled to begin on February 18, 2025.\nMesothelioma and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The Company\nseparately has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date and has resolved the State claims.\nTo account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the\nCompany recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $ 5.0billion, through the fourth fiscal quarter\n2024. As of December 29, 2024, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $ 11.6billion (or nominal\nvalue of approximately $ 13.5billion), net of payments made in fiscal 2024. Approximately ten percent of the\nreserve is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable\nloss.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nChapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a Chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties. Cyprus also asserts it has claims for indemnity against the\nCompany arising out of talc personal injury claims. Under the Cyprus Plan, Cyprus would also contribute its alleged\nindemnification rights to the trust.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. The Company opposed both plans on the basis that the plans inflated Imerys’s and Cyprus’s\nliability for talc claims and had the potential effect of imposing those inflated liabilities on the Company\nthrough the Company’s alleged indemnification obligations.\nIn July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities),\nand the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in their respective Chapter 11\ncases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement Agreement) to resolve their ongoing\ndisputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus bankruptcies. In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed\namended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure statements incorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In\nOctober 2024, the Imerys Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the\nSettlement Order). The effectiveness of certain provisions of the settlement, including mutual releases, are\nsubject to certain conditions, including the Imerys and Cyprus Plans being accepted by a sufficient number and\namount of voting creditors to be confirmed under the Bankruptcy Code. Certain insurers have appealed the Settlement\nOrder and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the Court denied on January 13, 2025. The briefing of\nthe appeal in the District Court is scheduled to be completed in April 2025. On January 5, 2025, Imerys and Cyprus\neach filed a certification of voting results, indicating that their respective plan had been accepted by each\nvoting class of creditors. A joint confirmation hearing for the plans is scheduled for April 2025.\n96\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The\ncase was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the\nCourt granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the\nThird Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class\ncertification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact\ndiscovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the\nparties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay\nfor certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on\nthe 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024. In January 2025, the Third\nCircuit listed the appeal for oral argument in March 2025.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up\nto $ 5.0billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal fourth quarter 2024. A\nfew government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve\nthe hospital cases.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are approximately 35 remaining opioid cases against the\nCompany and JPI in various state courts, 390 remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and 4\nadditional cases in other federal courts.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of\nother provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed\nclass action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against\nJanssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024.\nStarting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had\nbeen dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\n2024 Annual Report97\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of December 29, 2024:\nProduct or product category                                  Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S    62,830\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip         60\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                          910\nPelvic meshes                                         5,990\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh              130\nRISPERDAL                                                 7\nELMIRON                                               2,170\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland,\nIndia and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers\nrepresenting ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the\nUnited States. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution\nsignificant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and\nthe settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The\nCompany has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-\nrelated product liability litigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\n98\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nand Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The vast majority of these actions\nare now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other\nthan a small number of cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been\nresolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nRISPERDAL\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to\nevaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but\nthere have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive\ndamages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021,\nthe Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in\nsubstantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other\nsettlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New\n2024 Annual Report99\nJersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated\nin a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have\nbeen coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in\nCanada. The Company continues to defend ELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential\ncosts related to those claims. All U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are undergoing formal review\nfor purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with\nELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that\ncertain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these\nsubsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all\nsignificant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases\ncould adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to\nloss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash\nimpairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and\nsuch settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to\nthe expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents.

Subsequent changes are\nreflected in other income/expense and amounted to $ 0.4billion expense through December 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $ 11.6billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $ 4.3billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $ 1.2billion to record the\ndeconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a non-cash gain on the exchange offer of $ 21.0billion that was\nrecorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for\nthe fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $ 2.8billion on the Kenvue Common Stock\nretained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nAlso in connection with the separation, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into a separation agreement and also\nentered into various other agreements that provide for certain transactions to effect the transfer of the assets\nand liabilities of the Consumer Health business to Kenvue and to govern various interim and ongoing relationships\nbetween Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson following the completion of the Kenvue IPO, including transition services\nagreements (TSAs), transition manufacturing agreements (TMAs), trademark agreements, intellectual property\nagreements, an employee matters agreement, and a tax matters agreement. Under the TSAs, Johnson & Johnson will\nprovide Kenvue various services and, similarly, Kenvue will provide Johnson & Johnson various services. The\nprovision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24months following the Kenvue IPO.\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson will manufacture\nand supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and supply to Johnson & Johnson\ncertain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from 3months to 5years.\nAmounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were immaterial for both\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for the above agreements was not\nmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nThe results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as well as the\nassociated gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nearnings as Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. As a result of the separation of Kenvue,\nJohnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $ 145million in the fiscal year 2024, which was included in Net\nEarnings and incurred separation costs of $ 986million and $ 1,089million in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, which were included in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. These costs were\nprimarily related to external advisory, legal, accounting, contractor and other\n2024 Annual Report105\nincremental costs directly related to separation activities. In the fiscal 2022, as part of the planned separation\nof the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company recognized approximately $ 0.5billion in net incremental tax\ncosts.\nDetails of Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes are as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                    2023(1)               2022\nSales to customers                                $10,036    14,953\nCost of products sold                               4,369     6,494\nGross profit                                        5,667     8,459\nSelling, marketing and administrative               3,085     4,519\nexpenses\nResearch and development expense                      258       468\nInterest Income                                      -117         —\nInterest expense, net of portion                      199         —\ncapitalized\nOther (income) expense, net                         1,092     1,060\n(Gain) on separation of Kenvue                    -20,984         —\nRestructuring                                           —        46\nEarnings from Discontinued Operations              22,134     2,366\nBefore Provision for Taxes on Income\nProvision for taxes on income                         307       795\nNet earnings from Discontinued                    $21,827     1,571\nOperations\n(1) The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Consumer Health business on August 23, 2023, the date of\nthe exchange offer, but continued to reflect any separation costs incurred as part of discontinued operations\nthrough the end of the fiscal fourth quarter.\nThe following table presents depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures of the discontinued operations\nrelated to Kenvue:\n(Dollars in Millions)            2023(1)          2022\nDepreciation and Amortization             $383     641\nCapital expenditures                      $162     303\n106\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of\ncomprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December\n29, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We\nalso have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2024 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management has excluded Shockwave\nMedical, Inc., (“Shockwave”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 29,\n2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded\nShockwave from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Shockwave is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose\ntotal assets and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting represent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the\nfiscal year ended December 29, 2024.\n2024 Annual Report107\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Innovative Medicine Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued rebates, returns, and promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical products within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $12.3 billion as of\nDecember 29, 2024. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nrebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical\nexperience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. Innovative Medicine\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nby management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when developing the estimate of these reserves and\n(ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the\nassumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected\nmarket conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s estimate of the U.S. Innovative Medicine rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare\nand Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also\nincluded, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information\non price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and\nthe historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing, on a sample basis, rebate\nclaims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and\nmandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s\nestimates to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates.\n108\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. In May 2024, the Company proposed a consensual “prepackaged” Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan\n(the “Proposed Plan”) for the final resolution of all current and future claims related to cosmetic talc in the\nUnited States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims. In September 2024, the\nCompany’s subsidiary Red River Talc, LLC filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the\nBankruptcy Code, in furtherance of the Company’s consensual “prepackaged” Proposed Plan. As of December 29, 2024,\nthe total present value of the reserve to resolve the talc claims is approximately $11.6 billion, of which\napproximately ten percent is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best\nestimate of probable loss. The Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts\naccrued.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the litigation\ncontingencies - talc is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the\nlikelihood of a loss being incurred for the remaining unresolved talc claims, when determining whether a reasonable\nestimate of the loss or range of loss for the remaining unresolved talc claims can be made, and when determining\nthe timing of settlement payments for the remaining unresolved talc claims, and (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s\nassessment of the loss contingencies associated with the talc litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s assessment of the litigation contingencies – talc, including controls over\ndetermining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as\nfinancial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others (i) gaining an understanding of the\nCompany’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) obtaining and evaluating\ncertain executed settlement agreements related to the talc litigation; (iii) discussing the status of significant\nknown actual and potential litigation and settlements activity with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well\nas external counsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal\nand external legal counsel related to the talc litigation; (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (vi) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n2024 Annual Report109\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 29, 2024. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company acquired Shockwave Medical, Inc. (Shockwave), in a business combination in May 2024. Shockwave’s total\nassets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related\nconsolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024. As the acquisition\noccurred in the fiscal year 2024, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2024 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion\nis in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted\nfrom the scope in the year of acquisition.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December\n29, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024 has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,\nwhich appears herein.\n/s/J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and\nparticipated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on internal control over financial reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated\nherein by reference to Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, and the attestation\nregarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the report of independent registered public\naccounting firm included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2024, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to\nmonitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment."
