We purchase substrates from\nIbiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from\nMicron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and\nconfiguration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors,\nmotherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United\nStates. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test\nspecifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.\nWe also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and ODMs such as\nWistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key\n9\nTable of Contents\nelements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are\nresponsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide\nbetter performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new\ncompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, including Intel’s\nrecent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated, AI\ncomputing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on\nInfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater\nmarketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer\nor technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions,\nincluding chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation,\nand Xilinx, Inc.;\nlarge internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated\ncomputing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc. and Amazon, Inc.;\nsuppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as\nAmbarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and\nXilinx or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\nsuppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks,\nBroadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum\nHoldings, Marvell Technology Group, and Xilinx, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet\nservices companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and\ninternationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021 to June 2045. We have numerous\npatents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending\npatent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We\nalso rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws\nof certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries\nin Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United\nStates. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We\ncontinuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based\non such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions;\nand\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWe have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon\nour capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate\nmaterial capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or\nfuture governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business\nacquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on\nour business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of January 31, 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research and\ndevelopment and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development\npersonnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below, in addition to an overview of\nemployee programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecruitment\nThe demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new\ncollege graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education\ninstitutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our\nemployees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our\ncommunity resource groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We\nhave a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based\nforums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common\ndevelopment needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to\nlearner feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition\nreimbursement programs and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We\nencourage internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide\ntrained coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource\ngroups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a\nsuggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour stockholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs\nin the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours\nand time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our\nbenefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including\nassistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those\nwho wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n11\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.\nWe have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those\nhistorically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In fiscal\nyear 2021, we created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity\nrecruiting leader, and a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents\nthe global population.\nEfforts we are undertaking include:\nShepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from\nunderrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in minority-\nserving institutions and professional organizations.\nDeveloping an internal slate of diverse talent for all open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent\nreview sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career\nacceleration programs.\nIncreasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiment.\nAs of January 31, 2021, our global workforce was 80% male and 20% female, and 6% of our workforce in the United\nStates was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nSafety and COVID-19\nWe support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to\nslow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020\nfor all except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources\nto work remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain\nopen, we instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided\nresources for employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work\nfrom home expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of\nFebruary 19, 2021:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       58    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

                "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other\ninformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such\nan investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following\nrisks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our\nstock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our\nrevenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nOur GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success\ndepends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products,\nservices and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable\ntechnical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the\ndevelopment of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as\nthe automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. For example, we must\ncontinue to accurately forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center business, and develop and\ndeliver next-generation autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be\nnegatively impacted. We also must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by\nleveraging our joint product capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes. We must also\ncontinue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and\nsupport, e-commerce and intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve our\nbusiness, including by developing\n13\nTable of Contents\nmarket specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies,\nexpanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our\nbusiness in various areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We also must meet customer safety\nand compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotive solutions and\nsystems. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not\nproduce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to\ndevelop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted,\nour business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure\nyou that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our\ncustomers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target\nmarkets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions\nevolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.\nFor our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor,\nincluding for our interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a\ncustomer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and\nconsumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in\nsubsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in\nfuture competitive bid selection processes.\nUnanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major\nhardware manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing\nindustry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design\nstrategies. Furthermore, winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as\nmuch revenue as anticipated, if any.\nCompetition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.\nOur target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors\nexpand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new\ncompetitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may\noffer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than\nexpected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own\nfabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios\nand patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user\ncustomer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line\nwidth geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. In\nour networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have\nin-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting\nsuch customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their\nown products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may\nbecome competitors to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. If we are unable\nto successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings\nto meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China,\ndemand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and\ncause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed\nand may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or\nsuppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing\nWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product\ndelivery schedule and could harm our business.\nWe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication\nfacility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nCompany Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication\nequipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on\nindependent subcontractors. In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment\ncontracts with these foundries or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and\ncapacity commitments\n14\nTable of Contents\nas our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain. As\nour business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet\ncustomer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue\nand/or financial results, including:\na lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices, which\ncould be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient\nquantities and/or in a timely manner;\na failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or\ntest capacity for our products;\na failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process\ntechnologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node\ntechnologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;\na limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change\na supplier;\na lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.\nIn addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase\nmanufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product\ndesign, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry.\nLow yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield\nproblem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be\nidentified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the\nproblem.\nWe also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of\nnew products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner.\nIn the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the\ninability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities\nof our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater\nfunctionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss\ndesign cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose\nmarket share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will\nbe harmed.\nIf our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our\nreputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.\nOur products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security\nvulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design,\nfabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are\nintroduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as\nnew versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or\nservice has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our\nproducts or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who\ndevelop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services.\nFailure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to\nthe products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs,\nAIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur\nsignificant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us\nto lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to\nfind and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers\nafter commencement of commercial shipments could result in\n15\nTable of Contents\nfailure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and\nharm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or\nconsumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive\nrecalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive,\ndamage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our\ncompetitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is\nbrought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our\ntechnical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be\ninadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial\nresults.\nRisks Related to Our Operating Business\nIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.\nOur products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are\nvery long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or\nexcess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel\nmodel, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions\nmade by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the\nchanging demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times\nand quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do\nnot occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what\nwe believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain,\nwe may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or\nprovide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial\nresults. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions,\ncompetitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue.\nFor example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency\nhas fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market,\nincluding changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\npending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for\nour new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our\nGaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop\nworkstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more\npronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple\nassumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our\nproducts, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Situations that may result in excess or\nobsolete inventory include:\nchanges in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;\nchanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;\na sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;\na higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;\nless demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or\nincreased competition, including competitive pricing actions.\nThe cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could\nadversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the\nlast month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in\nresponse to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of\ncost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if\nwe incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.\n16\nTable of Contents\nConversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate\nlead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill\ncustomers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other\nevents. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be\nable to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis,\nor at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation\ncould be damaged.\nSystem security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our\nexpected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in\nrecent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend\nagainst them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past\nand are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our\nsecurity controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third\nparties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy\nviruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in\nour products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve\nfunctionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication\nsoftware products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience\nbreaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of\nour third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach. To date, our investigations of\nthis breach, which were supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data\nsecurity breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our\nsystems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must\ncontinuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in\nincreased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have\nappropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or\nour business could be negatively impacted.\nActual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved\ndissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or\nthird parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting\nin litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and\nreputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our\nexpenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of\nexisting or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and\ninterrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions\ncould adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages,\noutages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions,\ncyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and\nother natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these\ndisruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our\ncosts and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in\norder to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in\nCalifornia, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located\nin Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data\ncenter capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business\ndisruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our\nproducts and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China,\nHong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs\nthrough Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the\nUnited States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic\ndisruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and\nprofitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement\n17\nTable of Contents\ncould result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and\ncontrols on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of\n2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party\nvendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel.\nIn addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political\nor social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase\nlevels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.\nPolitical instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major\ncountries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are\ndisrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts\nfrom climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,\nenvironmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries\nand other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or\ncatastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result\nof declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.\nAll of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain\nthe disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These\nmeasures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and\nour partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party\ncontract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods\ninventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers\nand suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions\nand closures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our business in both\npositive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact. In the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to\nwork, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home\ntrends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID\nlevels. In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in\nsales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand\nglobally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which\ncould cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain\nsupply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from\ncustomers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net\nnegative impact on our business and financial results.\nThe manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are\nconcentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant\nportion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our\nheadquarters is located in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and\nhas taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on\nour support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable\nuncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as\nrestrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport,\nport closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-\nfrom-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take\nfurther actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best\ninterests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely.\nThere is no\n18\nTable of Contents\ncertainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to\nperform critical functions could be harmed.\nWhile the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to\nassess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global\nfinancial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or\nfuture purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting\nfrom the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting\ndemand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to\nchange. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including\nour ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future\ndevelopments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the\nactions to contain the disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related\nrestrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any\nrecession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of\nglobal supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative\nimpact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the\nfull extent and duration is uncertain.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or\ninvestments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to\nsuccessfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products\nor sell our products.\nWe have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that\noffer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products,\nstrategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April\n2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a\ntransaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or\ninvestments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop\nnew products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial\nresults. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs;\naccordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other\ntransactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete\nacquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce\nthe anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may\nin the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments.\nAdditional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or\nstrategic investments include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business;\ndifficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;\nacquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating\ninternational operations and joint ventures;\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;\ndifficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other\napprovals or financing;\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an\nacquisition;\nthe potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for\nan acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\nfailure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;\nlegal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nuncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nthe need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or\ncompany; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of\nour acquisition or investment.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and\nour revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms\nthrough their channels. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our\npartner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the\nfuture, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:\nmost of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay\nproduct purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;\nour partners may develop their own solutions;\nour customers may purchase products from our competitors; or\nour partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.\nWe could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade\nrestrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our\ninability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and\nresults of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our\ncustomers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these\ncustomers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain\nsales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit\ninsurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic\nconditions, which may harm our business.\nWe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our\nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the\nUnited States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We\nallocate revenue\n20\nTable of Contents\nto individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’\nrevenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of\nthe United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92% for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for\nfiscal year 2019. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021.\nAdditionally, as of January 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States.\nThe global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\ninternational economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do\nbusiness;\nunexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws\nand employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions;\ndiffering legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business\npractices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption\nlaws and regulations;\nexporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions,\ntariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;\ndisruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations;\nincreased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and\npollution limits; and\nnatural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor\n“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events.\nIf our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue\nmay be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas\nincluding, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption;\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising;\nemployment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with\nsuch requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively.\nExpanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely\naffect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for\nthose workloads.\nAlthough we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there\ncan be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our\npolicies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our\nofficers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The\ntechnology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our\nexposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.\nAdverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital\nexpenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence\nand spending, periodically occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand\nuncertainty. It is likely that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible\nthat it could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the\npandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating\nresults and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A slowdown\nin economic growth could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a\ndecrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our\ncustomers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability\nto supply our products to our customers and/or the\n21\nTable of Contents\ninability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers,\ncustomers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by\ncounterparties; and/or negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining\ncapital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge\nwith other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result\nin lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect\nsuppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations\nand deliver our products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other\nequipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or\nincreased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced\navailability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties\nincluding financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial\ninstruments.\nAdditionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing\nlocated in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may\ndirectly affect our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the\npast been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future. Other countries have in the past, and may\ncontinue in the future, to restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations.\nFurther, we are unable to ship products manufactured in Israel to certain countries. These laws and policies may\nhave an impact on our results of operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute\nour business strategy effectively.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and\ndevelopment personnel is critical to our business. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally,\nchanges in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or\nregulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in\nour recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful\nproducts and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs\nin the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to\nour workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce\nneeds. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the\nanticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business. Effective succession planning is also\nimportant to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions\ninvolving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We continue to evolve our business\npractices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are\nworking remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices\nthat remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees\nsufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity could be impacted, or we could fail to retain them.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous\nfactors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of our future performance.\nAdditional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect\nour results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;\nour inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of\nour products and services;\nfluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in the\nrisk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed;”\n22\nTable of Contents\nchanges in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;\nour ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;\nour ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;\nproduct rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;\nour ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;\nsupply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;\ninventory write-downs;\nour ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our\npartner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner\nnetwork’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies;\nour dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand;\nthe inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit\ninsurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;\ncustomer bad debt write-offs;\nany unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;\nunexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;\nour ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal controls;\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and\ngeneral macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial\nresults. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could\ncause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings\nalleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that\nwe have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual\nproperty related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents,\nindemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that\nour products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur\nsignificant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and\nattention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such\nproceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we\ncould be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made\nagainst us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our\nindemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However,\nwe may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we\nor one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is\nused in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the\nmanufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross\nlicense our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business\ncould be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our\noperating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a\ncombination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United\nStates and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our\nintellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our\nproducts or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the\npossibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or\npublication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position\nand reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development,\nproduct development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our intellectual property if our\nemployees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection\nfor existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such\nprotections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential\nusers from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\nOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information\nthat is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of\nour products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal\ninformation or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our\nreputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used,\nstored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased\nsecurity costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or\nincreased costs related to defending legal claims.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data\nprotection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General\nData Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018\nregarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is\nstored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in\npenalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of\n2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access,\ndelete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how\nit is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right\nof action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy\nlaws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California\nPrivacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use\nof certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising\ntechniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches\nsubject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and\nenforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the\nstates in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting\na trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.\nThe interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere\nare often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data\npractices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing\nlaws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on\nour business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in\nsignificant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher\nthan expected tax rates.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll,\nsales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various\nforeign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and\nexpenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for\nincome taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.\nFor example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019\nand under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are\nreasonable, tax authorities may\n24\nTable of Contents\ndisagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our\nworldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or\ninternational tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially\nimpact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.\nOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in\navailable tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally\naccepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses\nnot deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in\ndeferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of\naccounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the\nincome tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts\nin the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of\nincome before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as\nthe expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may\nreduce our net income.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or\ninvestigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a\nglobal basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and\ncertain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our\nbehalf, filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of\ndirectors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or\nsettlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and\noverall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to\nour operations.\nIn addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be\nrequired to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and\nregulations.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft\nCorporation could delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our\noutstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;\nthe prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder\napproval;\na super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nthe inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOn March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips\nand to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an\nindividual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares\nof our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft\nprovision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These\nprovisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of\ntheir choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or\nfulfilling our contractual obligations.\nIn March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040,\n$2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March\n2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20%\nNotes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments\nrelated to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return\nprogram and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments\nand other general corporate purposes."

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 19,\n2021, we had approximately 303 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a\ntotal cost of $7.08 billion through January 31, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed\ninto treasury stock.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share\nrepurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other\nfactors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may\nbe suspended at any time at our discretion.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized,\nsubject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December\n2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.\nRestricted Stock Unit Share Withholding\nWe also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations\nupon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year\n2021, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $942 million through net share settlements.\nRefer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.\n27\nTable of Contents\nStock Performance Graphs\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and\nthe Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a\nfocus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the\nsustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU\narchitecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.\nThrough fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. We changed our reportable segments\nto \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking\" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\nOur Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing;\nMellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements,\nand autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.\nAll prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming,\nProfessional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nPending Acquisition of Arm Limited\nOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank,\nall allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in cash\nat signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and\nissue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction\nincludes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by\nArm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can\nelect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our\ncommon stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2\nbillion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the\nprepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a\n20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of\nspecified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting\nperiod, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain\nother assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European\nUnion, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will\nbe refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair\nvalue basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We\nbelieve the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.\nDemand\nOur products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are\nvery long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or\nexcess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel\nmodel, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions\nmade\n29\nTable of Contents\nby our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing\ndemand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and\nquicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not\noccur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we\nbelieve is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we\nmay place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or\nprovide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial\nresults. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions,\ncompetitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue.\nFor example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency\nhas fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market,\nincluding changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\npending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for\nour new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our\nGaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop\nworkstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more\npronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating\ntrends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\nCOVID-19\nThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including\nrestrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly\nimpacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March\n2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel.\nOur Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn,\nand play from home. In Professional Visualization, mobile workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home\ntrends, and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In\nAutomotive, COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand. Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand\nglobally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply\nchain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and\nfinancial results. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information under the\nheading “Risk Factors”.\nWe believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper\nand other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset\npurchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.\nFiscal Year 2021 Summary\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,          January 26,\n2021                 2020       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                           16,675       $       10,918               Up 53%\nGross margin                                                  62.3  %              62.0  %            Up 30 bps\nOperating expenses              $                            5,864       $        3,922               Up 50%\nIncome from operations          $                            4,532       $        2,846               Up 59%\nNet income                      $                            4,332       $        2,796               Up 55%\nNet income per diluted share    $                             6.90       $         4.52               Up 53%\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $16.68 billion, up 53% from a year earlier.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFrom a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was up 41% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales across\ndesktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs. GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce\nRTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 13% from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations\nas enterprise demand was impacted by COVID.\nData Center revenue was up 124% from a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the ramp\nof the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal year 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total company\nrevenue.\nAutomotive revenue was down 23% from a year earlier, reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy\ninfotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements, partially offset by increases in AI cockpit and\nautonomous vehicle solutions.\nOEM and Other revenue was up 25% from a year ago, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by product mix with\nhigher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $5.86 billion, up 50% from a year ago. The growth was influenced by\nthe inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, employee additions and increases in employee\ncompensation and related expenses. Additionally, acquisition-related and other costs of $411 million primarily\ninclude $190 million in non-recurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog, $123 million in recurring\namortization of Mellanox intangible assets, and $40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm.\nIncome from operations for fiscal year 2021 was $4.53 billion, up 59% from a year earlier. Net income and net\nincome per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were $4.33 billion and $6.90, up 55% and 53%, respectively, from a\nyear earlier.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021, compared with $10.90\nbillion as of January 26, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March\n2020 and cash-flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions.\nWe paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in our Gaming platform, we announced the launch of new laptop models powered by NVIDIA\nGeForce GPUs; unveiled GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs including our second generation NVIDIA RTX; expanded NVIDIA\nGeForce NOW; announced that a range of games now support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS AI super resolution;\nunveiled NVIDIA Reflex and NVIDIA Broadcast; expanded the RTX Studio lineup powered by new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs;\nand released DLSS 2.0.\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we launched mobile workstations with Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and\nMicrosoft based on NVIDIA Quadro graphics for professional creators; released NVIDIA Quadro View; collaborated with\nAdobe to bring GPU-accelerated neural filters to Adobe Photoshop AI-powered tools; powered Autodesk’s latest 3D\nvisualization software with NVIDIA Quadro RTX; and collaborated with many other independent software vendors to\nhelp incorporate NVIDIA RTX and AI technology in their applications.\nIn our Data Center platform, we announced the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and DGX A100, the first products based on\nthe NVIDIA Ampere architecture; announced more than 50 NVIDIA A100-powered systems with OEM partners and released\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems with NVIDIA A100 GPUs to OEMs; shared news that major cloud providers, including Google\nCloud Platform, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, reached general availability of cloud\ncomputing instances based on the NVIDIA A100 GPU; announced the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD Solution for Enterprise;\nintroduced the new family of NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs; introduced new products for the EGX Edge AI platform;\nannounced a broad partnership with VMware to create an end-to-end enterprise platform for AI and a new architecture\nfor data center, cloud and edge; powered eight of the top 10, and two-thirds of the total systems, on the latest\nTOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers; announced that five supercomputers backed by EuroHPC will use\nNVIDIA’s data center accelerators or networking; and set 16 AI performance records on the latest MLPerf benchmarks.\nIn our Automotive platform, we announced with Mercedes-Benz that the automaker will launch software-defined,\nintelligent vehicles using end-to-end NVIDIA technology starting in 2024; announced that NVIDIA DRIVE autonomous\n31\nTable of Contents\ndriving technology is powering a range of electric vehicles from carmakers SAIC, Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng, robotaxi-\nmaker Zoox, and cabless truck-maker Einride; announced that NVIDIA is powering the new Mercedes-Benz AI cockpit in\nthe first half of 2021; announced that Hyundai Motor Group’s entire lineup of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models will\ncome standard with NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment systems starting in 2022; and expanded the NVIDIA DRIVE\nsensor ecosystem with new solutions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses\nand related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related\nto business combinations, inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of\nthese critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit\nCommittee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price\nexceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly\nintangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In\ncertain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions\nand subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly,\nthe measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and\ncircumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period\nadjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been\nrecorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.\nGoodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business\ncombination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible\narises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and\nsold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract,\nasset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and\ntrade name acquired in a business combination and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally\nassess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate\nfair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market\nconditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require\nsignificant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our\nassessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological\nfeasibility.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments\ncompared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or\n32\nTable of Contents\nunexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer\npurchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was\ninsignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to\npurchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party\nmanufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and\npricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact\ndemand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and\nsoftware licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the\ncontract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of\nthe transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n(where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs\nto determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or\nas, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold\nalong with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the\nservice period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer\nprograms and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our\nintellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the\ndevelopment services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are\nperformed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated\ntotal cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we\nrecord a provision for such loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change\n33\nTable of Contents\nbased, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax\nlaws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.\nIn addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these\namounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if\nindicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment\nreview process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.\nWe changed our reportable segments to \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking\" starting with the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2021. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new\nreporting units based on their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately\nprior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and\nthe amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and\n$3.85 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and\ninvolves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating\nassets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe\nto be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative\nassessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal\nyear 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 26, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\nRevenue                                    100.0  %          100.0  %\nCost of revenue                             37.7              38.0\nGross profit                                62.3              62.0\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development                    23.5              25.9\nSales, general and administrative           11.6              10.0\nTotal operating expenses                    35.1              35.9\nIncome from operations                      27.2              26.1\nInterest income                              0.3               1.6\nInterest expense                            -1.1              -0.5\nOther, net                                   0.1                 —\nOther income (expense), net                 -0.7               1.1\nIncome before income tax expense            26.5              27.2\nIncome tax expense                           0.5               1.6\nNet income                                  26.0  %           25.6  %\nRevenue\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,            $         %\n2021              2020       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nGraphics                $           9,834    $        7,639    $   2,195        29  %\nCompute & Networking                6,841             3,279        3,562       109  %\nTotal                   $          16,675    $       10,918    $   5,757        53  %\nGraphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 29% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting\ngrowth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations.\nCompute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to\nfiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA\nAmpere GPU architecture systems and new products.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal\nyears 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the\nlocation to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a\ndifferent location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of\nour total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and\npackaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of\n35\nTable of Contents\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal\nyear 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by\nMellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and\nongoing intangible asset amortization of $263 million.\nInventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of\ninventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nAs a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nA discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:\nGraphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year\n2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix\nwithin Quadro/Nvidia RTX.\nCompute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when\ncompared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data Center\ncompute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,          January 26,               $         %\n2021                 2020          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           3,924       $        2,829       $   1,095        39  %\n% of net revenue                                  23.5  %              25.9  %\nSales, general and administrative                1,940                1,093             847        77  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                  11.6  %              10.0  %\nTotal operating expenses             $           5,864       $        3,922       $   1,942        50  %\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven\nprimarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related\ncosts, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020,\ndriven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related\ncosts, including stock-based compensation.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income\nwas $57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was\nprimarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September\n2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our\nannual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a\ndecrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from\nstock-based compensation.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the\ntax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and\nexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $           847    $       10,896\nMarketable securities                              10,714                 1\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        11,561    $       10,897\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $         5,822    $        4,761\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $       -19,675    $        6,145\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing    $         3,804    $         -792\nactivities\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of\n$664 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed\nincome securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our\nportfolio.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was\nallocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion, the prepayment of intellectual\nproperty licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment\nresulted in $1.36 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion\nfor the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets\nand $0.47 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, due to higher net\nincome, higher non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital\ninclude increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables, both due to higher fiscal year 2021\nrevenue, and a prepayment of royalties to Arm.\nCash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020,\nwhich primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed\nacquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and\nintangible assets, and lower sales of marketable securities, offset by higher maturities of marketable securities.\nCash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020,\nwhich primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, offset by payments related to\ntax on restricted stock units.\n37\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash\ngenerated by our operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Arm. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital\nresources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our\ncapital requirements beyond twelve months. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These\nmarketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and\nthe cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion\nrelated to property and equipment, including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus.\nWe have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for\nwhich we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than\nthat, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of\nJanuary 31, 2021 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to\nNote 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for additional information.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nIn fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of\nfuture cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of\nour common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year\n2021.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities\nWe have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due\n2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes.\nWe have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the\nSeptember 2016 Notes.\nWe have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can\nobtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under\nthis agreement.\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we\nhad not issued any commercial paper.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have $157 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax\nbenefits of $395 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $43 million recorded in non-current\nincome tax payable as of January 31, 2021. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax\nliability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax\npositions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by\nthe Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

                "content": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis,\nparallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would\nresult in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these\ninvestments of $8 million, respectively.\nIn September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March\n2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050,\nand $500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with\nchanges in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item\n15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of\nforeign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years\n2021 and 2020.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have\ninternational operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses\nbenefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our\noperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge\nrelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are\nrecognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in\nother income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been approximately $84 million and $43 million lower as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset\na corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $44 million and $29 million as of January 31,\n2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense),\nnet by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,\nassuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information."

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 31, 2021, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable\nassurance.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no\nchanges in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the\nfact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually\nmonitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating\neffectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe\nthat we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial\nreporting during this integration.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n40\nTable of Contents"

Exhibits\nThe exhibits listed in the accompanying index to exhibits are filed or incorporated by          79\nreference as a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n43\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the\n\"Company\") as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January\n31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item\n15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it\naccounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of\n44\nTable of Contents\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd.- Valuation of Developed Technology and In-process Research and\nDevelopment Intangible Assets Acquired\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2021 the Company completed the\nacquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for consideration of approximately $7.13 billion, of which $1,640 million\nof developed technology and $630 million of in-process research and development intangible assets were recorded.\nThe fair values of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets were determined\nusing the multi-period excess earnings method. As disclosed by management, management applied significant judgment\nin estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of certain estimates and\nassumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, the technology migration curve, and\nrisk-adjusted discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the\ndeveloped technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of\nMellanox Technologies Ltd. is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity\nin applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of developed technology and in-process research and\ndevelopment intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate,\n(ii) significant audit effort in evaluating management’s assumptions relating to the estimate, such as revenue\ngrowth and the technology migration curve, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible\nassets and controls over development of the assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration\ncurve. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s\nprocess for estimating the fair value of the developed technology and in-process research and development\nintangible assets acquired. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation\nmethod and the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology\nmigration curve for the intangible assets acquired, and using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to\nassist with the evaluation. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past\nperformance of the acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts. The technology migration curve was\nevaluated by considering the revenue attribution between existing technology and in-process research and\ndevelopment based on the assessment of the separation of forecasted future revenue between developed products and\nnew generation products and the technology carryover rate.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory\nprovisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess\ninventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As\n45\nTable of Contents\ndisclosed by management, the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market\nconditions. As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,826 million.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgments by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including\ndeveloping assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over\nmanagement’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating\nthe appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data\nused in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and\nmarket conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved\nevaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results,\nincluding historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes\nin technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year.\nFiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement\ncosts, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates\nconsider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and\nsoftware licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the\ncontract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of\nthe transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n(where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs\nto determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or\nas, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold\nalong with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the\nservice period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer\nprograms and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our\nintellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the\ndevelopment services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are\nperformed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated\ntotal cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we\nrecord a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-\ncontract customer support, or PCS. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made\navailable to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from oneto three yearsfor products in order to\nrepair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes\nthe estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for\nknown warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or\nESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.\nStock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we\nestimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent\nperiods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many\nuncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other\nthird-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If\ninformation becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we\nwill record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or\ninvestigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary\nassets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary\nassets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those\nexpenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nGains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\n53\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $ 728million related to state and certain foreign deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method,\nthe effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for\nperiods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of\nacquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the\nrelated unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of\nshareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest.\nRealized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification\nmethod and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAll of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair\nvalue of an available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the\ndifference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities\nif it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its\namortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in other income (expense), net\nsection of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses\n54\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair\nvalue of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are\nrecognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative\ninstruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of\nchange together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For\nderivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the\nderivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently\nrecognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not\ndesignated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our\ncustomers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer\nissues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of\ngross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit\ninsurance or letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and\noverhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of\npurchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down\nour inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our\ninventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally threeto five years. Once an asset is\nidentified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and\nassets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease\n55\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nwhen it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a\nqualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are\nnot limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable\nmultiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates\nregarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process\nresearch and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology\nlicenses, patents, and acquired intellectual property. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite\nlives over periods ranging from twoto twenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic\nbenefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an\nintangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an\namortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nexceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be\ndisposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the\nfair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,\nbut our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions\nused in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are\ninherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the\nmeasurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nonly if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded\nthrough net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities\nby the investee.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing\nincurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires\nconsideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for\naccounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the\nstandard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nPending Acquisition of Arm Limited\nOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank\nall allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40billion. We paid $ 2billion in\nSigning Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10billion in cash and issue to SoftBank\n44.3million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $ 21.5billion. The transaction includes a\npotential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during\nthe fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either\nup to an additional $ 5billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3million shares of our common stock. We will issue\nup to $ 1.5billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2billion paid upon signing was\nallocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36billion and the prepayment of intellectual\nproperty licenses from Arm of $ 0.17billion and royalties of $ 0.47billion, both with a 20-yearterm. The closing of\nthe acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and\nregulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation\nof the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are\nengaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other\njurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $\n1.25billion of the Signing Consideration. The $ 2billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis\nand any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the\nclosing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\nOn April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase\nconsideration of $ 7.13billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing,\nstorage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the\nentire computing, networking, and storage stack.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\nPurchase Price\nCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares    $  7,033\n(1)\nCash for Mellanox equity awards (2)                         16\nTotal cash consideration                                 7,049\nFair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by             85\nNVIDIA (3)\nTotal purchase consideration                          $  7,134\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents                             $    115\nMarketable securities                                      699\nAccounts receivable, net                                   216\nInventories                                                320\nPrepaid expenses and other assets                          179\nProperty and equipment, net                                144\nGoodwill                                                 3,431\nIntangible assets                                        2,970\nAccounts payable                                          -136\nAccrued and other current liabilities                     -236\nIncome tax liability                                      -191\nDeferred income tax liability                             -258\nOther long-term liabilities                               -119\n$  7,134\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately\n56million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249thousand Mellanox stock options held\nby employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices.\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non the estimated fair values.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.\nGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim\nindicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax\npurposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment.\nRefer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021\nsince the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal\nyear 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration.\nAcquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28million were included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:\nFair Value\n(In millions)    Useful Lives\nDeveloped technology (1)                    $          1,640    5 years\nCustomer relationships (2)                               440    3 years\nOrder backlog (3)                                        190    Based on actual shipments\nTrade names (4)                                           70    5 years\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible               2,340\nassets\nIPR&D (5)                                                630    N/A\nTotal identified intangible assets          $          2,970\n(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without\nMethod.\n(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-\nPeriod Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-\nRoyalty Method under the income approach.\n(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the\npattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset\nof $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project\nwill be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project\nmay be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility,\nwe will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.\nSupplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA\nand Mellanox as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020:\nPro Forma\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nRevenue       $        17,104    $       12,250\nNet income    $         4,757    $        2,114\nThe unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets,\nadjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs.

This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5years for RSUs, PSUs,\nand market-based PSUs, and 0.9years for ESPP.\nThe fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,                       January 26,    January 27,\n2021                              2020           2019\n-Using the Black-Scholes model\nESPP\nWeighted average expected life (in    0.1-2.0                           0.1-2.0        0.1-2.0\nyears)\nRisk-free interest rate               0.1%-1.6%                         1.5%-2.6%      1.6%-2.8%\nVolatility                            26%-89%                           30%-82%        24%-75%\nDividend yield                        0.1%-0.3%                         0.3%-0.4%      0.3%-0.4%\nFor ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the\npurchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed the stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and substituted them with our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and\nrestated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other\nstock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options.\nAs of January 31, 2021, up to 244million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards\ngranted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options.\nAll options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by May 2024 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs,\nPSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 31, 2021, there were 37million shares\navailable for future issuance.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject\nto continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of\ngrant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with\n40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting\nquarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-yearanniversary of the date of grant.\nHowever, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated,\nthe 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock.\nStarting in March 2021, employees who participate may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares\nof common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately\n24months, which is generally divided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased\nunder our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the\ncommencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. As\nof January 31, 2021, we had 60million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\nNumber of Shares            Weighted Average\n(In millions, except years and per share data)       Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalances, January 26, 2020                                                       14    $                 176.72\nGranted                                                                           9    $                 307.25\nVested restricted stock                                                          -7    $                 159.35\nCanceled and forfeited                                                           -1    $                 193.83\nBalances, January 31, 2021                                                       15    $                 264.69\nVested and expected to vest after                                                14    $                 264.13\nJanuary 31, 2021\nAs of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, there were 37million and 29million shares, respectively, of common\nstock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $\n1.20billion, with an average exercise price of $ 14.40per share and an average remaining term of 1.7years.

As a result, our\nreporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their\nrelative fair values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there was nogoodwill\nimpairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill\nwas $ 4.19billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was\n$ 347million and $ 3.85billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $\n618million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $\n347million and $ 271million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $ 3.57billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill\nof $ 3.43billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $ 143million from other acquisition\nactivities, all of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of\nfiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired in any of these years.\nNote 7 - Amortizable Intangible Assets\nThe components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows:\nJanuary 31,                                           January\n2021                                          26, 2020\nGross       Accumulated            Net            Gross       Accumulated            Net\nCarrying       Amortizati…       Carrying         Carrying       Amortizati…       Carrying\nAmount                           Amount           Amount                           Amount\n-In                                               -In\nmillions                                          millions\nAcquisiti…\nintangible    $        3,280    $         -774    $     2,506    $         195    $         -192    $         3\nassets\n(1)\nPatents\nand                      706              -475            231              520              -474             46\nlicensed\ntechnology\nTotal\nintangible    $        3,986    $       -1,249    $     2,737    $         715    $         -666    $        49\nassets\n(1) As of January 31, 2021, acquisition-related intangible assets include the fair value of a Mellanox IPR&D\nproject of $ 630million, which has not been amortized.

Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of\nintangible assets as of January 31, 2021 is estimated to be $ 548million in fiscal year 2022, $ 545million in\nfiscal year 2023, $ 423million in fiscal year 2024, $ 367million in fiscal year 2025, $ 97million in fiscal year\n2026, and $ 757million in fiscal year 2027 and thereafter.\nNote 8 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale”\ndebt securities.\n64\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nThe following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26,\n2020:\nJanuary 31,\n2021\nAmortized       Unrealized       Unrealized          Estimated         Reported\nCost             Gain       Loss               Fair Value               as\nCash               Marketable\nEquivalents        Securities\n-In\nmillions\nCorporate\ndebt          $        4,442    $           2    $  —              $        4,444    $         234    $   4,210\nsecurities\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by\nUnited                 2,975                1       —                       2,976               28        2,948\nStates\ngovernment\nagencies\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by              2,846                —       —                       2,846               25        2,821\nthe United\nStates\nTreasury\nCertifica…               705                —       —                         705               37          668\nof deposit\nMoney\nmarket                   313                —       —                         313              313            —\nfunds\nForeign\ngovernment                67                —       —                          67                            67\nbonds\nTotal         $       11,348    $           3    $  —              $       11,351    $         637    $  10,714\nJanuary 26,\n2020\nAmortized       Unrealized       Unrealized            Estimated       Reported as\nCost       Gain             Loss                 Fair Value\nCash                 Marketable\nEquivalents          Securities\n-In millions\nMoney\nmarket         $         7,507    $  —             $  —               $         7,507    $        7,507    $  —\nfunds\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by                1,358       —                —                         1,358             1,358       —\nthe United\nStates\nTreasury\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by\nUnited                   1,096       —                —                         1,096             1,096       —\nStates\ngovernment\nagencies\nCorporate\ndebt                       592       —                —                           592               592       —\nsecurities\nForeign\ngovernment                 200       —                —                           200               200       —\nbonds\nCertificat…                 27       —                —                            27                27       —\nof deposit\nAsset-back…                  1       —                —                             1                 —       1\nsecurities\nTotal          $        10,781    $  —             $  —               $        10,781    $       10,780    $  1\nNet realized gains and unrealized gains and losses were not significant for all periods presented.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2021\nand January 26, 2020 are shown below by contractual maturity.\nJanuary 31, 2021                        January 26, 2020\nAmortized        Estimated              Amortized        Estimated\nCost       Fair Value                   Cost       Fair Value\n-In millions\nLess than one year    $            10,782    $      10,783    $            10,781    $      10,781\nDue in 1 - 5 years                    566              568                      —                —\nTotal                 $            11,348    $      11,351    $            10,781    $      10,781\n65\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 9 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical\nassets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.

Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.\nNote 12 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nIn March 2020, we issued $ 1.50billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $ 1.00billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $\n2.00billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $ 500million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March\n2020 Notes.

The Credit Agreement expires October 2021.\nWe have a $ 575million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we\nhad not issued any commercial paper.\nNote 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $ 2.54billion, which are\nexpected to occur over the next 12 months, and other purchase obligations totaling $ 317million, which are\nprimarily expected to occur over the next 18 months.\nAccrual for Product Warranty Liabilities\nThe estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 22million and $ 15million as of January 31, 2021 and\nJanuary 26, 2020, respectively.\nIn connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the\nindemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual\nproperty indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential\nfuture payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.

The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and\ncertain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the\nExchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory\nand the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nallege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.\nPlaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and\nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On\nJune 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any\nclaims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the\nmotion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet issued a decision.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint\nin the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary\nduty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the\nExchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory\nand the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other\nrelief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the\nIn Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty,\nunjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading\nstatements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek\nunspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and\nunspecified corporate governance measures.\nIt is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to\nthese same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal                         $           197    $           65    $            1\nState                                         1                 4                 —\nForeign                                     161                87                69\nTotal current                               359               156                70\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal                                    -246                 2              -315\nForeign                                     -36                16                 —\nTotal deferred                             -282                18              -315\nIncome tax expense (benefit)    $            77    $          174    $         -245\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nDomestic                    $         1,437    $          620    $        1,843\nForeign                               2,972             2,350             2,053\nIncome before income tax    $         4,409    $        2,970    $        3,896\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of\n21% to income before income taxes as follows:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nTax expense computed at federal           $           926    $          624    $          818\nstatutory rate\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal tax                 10                12                23\neffect\nForeign tax rate differential                        -561              -301              -412\nU.S. federal R&D tax credit                          -173              -110              -141\nStock-based compensation                             -136               -60              -191\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017                           —                 —              -368\nOther                                                  11                 9                26\nIncome tax expense (benefit)              $            77    $          174    $         -245\n72\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nThe tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are presented below:\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nDeferred tax assets:\nGILTI deferred tax assets               $           709    $          428\nResearch and other tax credit                       650               605\ncarryforwards\nOperating lease liabilities                         120               114\nNet operating loss carryforwards                    100                62\nAccruals and reserves, not currently                 59                39\ndeductible for tax purposes\nStock-based compensation                             36                28\nProperty, equipment and intangible                   32                12\nassets\nGross deferred tax assets                         1,706             1,288\nLess valuation allowance                           -728              -621\nTotal deferred tax assets                           978               667\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAcquired intangibles                               -191                -1\nUnremitted earnings of foreign                     -111               -40\nsubsidiaries\nOperating lease assets                             -111              -107\nGross deferred tax liabilities                     -413              -148\nNet deferred tax asset (1)              $           565    $          519\n(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 806million and $ 548million and long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities of $ 241million and $ 29million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognized an income tax expense of $ 77million and $ 174million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nand income tax benefit of $ 245million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7%, 5.9%, and (\n6.3)% for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year\n2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject\nto United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective\ntax rate in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence\nof tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%\ndue primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where\nthe tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits,\nexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax\neffects of the TCJA in 2019.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the\nacquisition, we recorded $ 256million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over\nthe tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also\nrecorded $ 153million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred\ntax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price\nallocation. As a result of the acquisition, as of January 31, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest\napproximately $ 1.16billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have\nnot provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments\nin Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $ 728million and $ 621million,\nrespectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be\nrealized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the\nperiod.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 333million, $\n308million and $ 344million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 344million may be carried forward\nindefinitely. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 238million that will\nbegin to expire in fiscal year 2035. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 987million, of which $\n944million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 43million is\nattributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2022. Our tax attributes, net\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or\nmodification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances.\nUtilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to\nlimitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state\nand foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and\ntax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had $ 776million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 606million would affect\nour effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 132million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state\nincome tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that\nwould likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 606million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31,\n2021 consisted of $ 352million recorded in non-current income taxes payable, $ 5million recorded in current income\ntaxes payable, and $ 249million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period            $           583    $          477    $          447\nIncreases in tax positions for current                158               104               129\nyear\nIncreases in tax positions for prior                   60                 7                52\nyears (1)\nDecreases in tax positions for prior                  -11                 —              -141\nyears\nSettlements                                            -5                 —                 —\nLapse in statute of limitations                        -9                -5               -10\nBalance at end of period                  $           776    $          583    $          477\n(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the\nMellanox acquisition.\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we\nanticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt\nof cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\nOur policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense. As of January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, we had accrued $ 44million, $ 31million,\nand $ 21million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits,\nwhich is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2021, unrecognized tax\nbenefits of $ 352million and the related interest and penalties of $ 43million are included in non-current income\ntaxes payable, and unrecognized tax benefits of $ 5million and the related interest and penalties of $ 1million are\nincluded in current income taxes payable.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 31, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on\nsuch tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 31,\n2021, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong,\nTaiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, and India for fiscal years 2005 through 2020. As of January 31,\n2021, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India, for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.\nNote 15 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nThrough January 31, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260million shares under our share repurchase program\nfor a total cost of $ 7.08billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury\nstock. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our\ncommon stock up to $ 7.24billion through December 2022.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we paid $ 395million in cash dividends to our shareholders.\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 120million, $ 76million, and $ 70million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported twooperating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the\nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in\nwhich our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The twonew operating segments are\n\"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking\". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments\nare equivalent to our reportable segments.\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for\ncloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute &\nNetworking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox\nnetworking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and\nautonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute &\nNetworking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include\nstock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal\nsettlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,\ntherefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment\nreporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our\nreportable segments and the “All Other” category.\n75\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nGraphics\nYear Ended January 31, 2021:       (In millions)       Compute & Networking       All Other       Consolidated\nRevenue                         $          9,834    $                 6,841    $          —    $        16,675\nOperating income (loss)         $          4,612    $                 2,548    $     -2,628    $         4,532\nYear Ended January 26, 2020:\nRevenue                         $          7,639    $                 3,279    $          —    $        10,918\nOperating income (loss)         $          3,267    $                   751    $     -1,172    $         2,846\nYear Ended January 27, 2019:\nRevenue                         $          8,159    $                 3,557    $          —    $        11,716\nOperating income (loss)         $          3,417    $                 1,251    $       -864    $         3,804\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nReconciling items included in \"All\nOther\" category:\nStock-based compensation expense         $        -1,397    $         -844    $         -557\nAcquisition-related intangible asset                -591                -6                -6\namortization\nUnallocated cost of revenue and                     -357              -283              -261\noperating expenses\nAcquisition-related inventory step-up               -161                 —                 —\ncharge\nAcquisition-related and other costs                  -84               -25                 4\nIP-related costs                                     -38               -14               -35\nLegal settlement costs                                 —                 —                -9\nTotal                                    $        -2,628    $       -1,172    $         -864\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are\ninitially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different\nlocation.

In fiscal year 2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and\nour revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will\ncontinue. Our fiscal year 2022 supply-constrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy,\nwhereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified\nby the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and\nassurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated\nwith owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for\nprocurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our\nresources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-\ncancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and\nprovided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.\nWe utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung\nElectronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor\nTechnology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd.,\nand Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use\ncontract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture\nour standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We\npurchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology\nCorporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often\nconsign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract\nmanufacturers.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and\nconfiguration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc., and\nthen ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry\nCo., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong,\nIsrael, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit\nand test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC\nsolutions.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SoCs, and\nother accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance\ninterconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our\n9\nTable of Contents\ncompetitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be\nmore able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the\nfuture.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing\nsolutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing\nfunctionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\nsuppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as\nAmbarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or\ncompanies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\nsuppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista\nNetworks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as\nwell as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\nissued patents have expiration dates from February 2022 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and\npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply\nwith such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could\nhave a material impact on our business. On February 8, 2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of\nthe transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance\nwith laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of\noperations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and\nconsumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\n10\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate sound\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and\ndiscussing with management our practices concerning ESG. We undertake an annual analysis to ensure that our ESG\npriorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These\nissues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our\nstakeholders.\nThe following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found\non the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility\nReport, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by\nreference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks,\nincluding current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting\nyear being fiscal year 2021, with our fiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been\nno material impact to capital expenditures, our results of operations or competitive position associated with\nglobal sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year\n2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for\nour offices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs\nare inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput and\nperformance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers are approximately 40x more energy efficient than\ntraditional CPU servers for AI workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong\npresence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the\nNovember 2021 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system\nwill build a digital twin of the Earth on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution\nclimate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of cities and nations so they can act with\nmore urgency.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and\ndevelopment and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nThe demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With differentiated\nhiring strategies for university, professional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting\ntop talent to NVIDIA.\nWe attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization\naffiliations, industry conferences, community resource group participation, direct sourcing and outreach. Our\nemployees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new hires coming from employee referrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include\nworkshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common\n11\nTable of Contents\ndevelopment needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current\nprograms and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and\nadvanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on\ndevelopmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed\nmentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure\nwidespread readiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize\nareas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts\nabout making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the\nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\nIn fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour stockholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and\nfinancial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee\nstock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-\nmanagement challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits\nbased on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support\nfor new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.\nWe have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those\nhistorically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino\ncandidates.\nOther efforts we have been or are undertaking include:\nExpanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with\nminority-serving institutions and professional organizations;\nSupported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;\nSupported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment; and\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of our workforce\nin the United States was composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nHealth and COVID-19\nWe support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022\nand the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and\noffices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also\nmade some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while adhering to government\nguidelines. Steps we took to support employees include:\nProviding work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain work from home\nexpenses;\n12\nTable of Contents\nEnhanced health coverage, including-COVID-19 testing, vaccine costs and support, expanded mental health resources\nand virtual care offerings, and care for those with COVID-19;\nLearning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely; and\nOpportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.\nWe will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for employees to\nrecharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of March\n11, 2022:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       59    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

                "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not\nlimited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part\nof your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our\nrevenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nOur accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization,\nand Automotive. These markets experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product\nintroductions and enhancements, and industry standards.\nOur strategic and business success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services and\ntechnologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\naccurately forecast demand in our businesses;\nmeet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;\nmanage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\ndevelop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support,\ne-commerce and IP licensing capabilities; and\ncomplete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.\nWe make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a\nlimited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to\ndevelop new products, services and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAchieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and\ndepend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers will demand. Unanticipated changes in\nindustry standards or disruptive technological innovation could render our products incompatible with products\ndeveloped by other companies. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards,\nour customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design\nwin may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not\nguarantee revenue.\nWe cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our\ncustomers and partners. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology\ntrends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, our business will be\nharmed.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCompetition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products,\nservices and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide\nbetter functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our\nproducts. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger\ncustomer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and\ngreater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more\neffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly\ntransition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-\nconstrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also\nintegrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar\nto ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable\nsuch customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully\ncompete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this\ncompetitive environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our\nrevenue to decline.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our\nfinancial results could be harmed.\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to\nmarket, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can\nimpact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our products through channel partners, who sell to\nretailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers\nand distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to\nproperly forecast demand.\nGPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining,\nincluding blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of\ncryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute\ntechnologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new\ncryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in\nthe future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products, and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\npending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased\naftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the\ndistribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce\nGPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from\ngamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of\nour LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our\ngaming GPUs and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether\nour strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold\non the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products compete with\nour distribution channels.\nConsumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data\nCenter, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may\ncontinue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside.\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires\nus to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of\nthe worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect\nour demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could\nlead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory.\nDemand for our products may be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and\ncause us to lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products\nand carry inventory for anticipated demand that does not materialize. We may not be able to reduce our inventory\npurchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors. We may write-\ndown our\n15\nTable of Contents\ninventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in\naverage selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand.\nSituations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include:\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in\nour target markets and/or overall economy and changes in the credit market;\nhigher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nnew product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to\nunexpected end use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\nfluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or\ndecrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design of future\nproducts where we have entered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments, particularly to the extent\nwe are placing orders well in advance of our historical lead times and/or before the design of those products is\nfinal.\nConversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate\nlead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders\non a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. If we are able\nto increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely\nmanner. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could\nbe damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain,\nas we are in today, we have placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our\nhistorical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example,\nwhile we previously placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time, we have begun placing orders at least\ntwelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future\nquarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such\nperiods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and\nfuture demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other\ncharges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is\nserved by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\nWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products,\nwhich reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and\nproduct delivery schedule and could harm our business.\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication\nfacility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and\ntechniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors.\nWe also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of\nnew products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater\nfunctionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for\ncapacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet\ncustomer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and\nadversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and\ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or in a timely manner;\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\n16\nTable of Contents\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nlimited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory\nmanufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change\na supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours; and\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology.\nIf our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our\nreputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or\nexperience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging,\nmaterials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices,\nmarkets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may\nonly be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our\nproducts or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious\nsoftware programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to\nspecifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been\nintegrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such\ndefect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product\nrecall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or\nreleases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve\nmarket acceptance, loss of design wins, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and\npartners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or\nconsumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field. If a product liability claim is brought\nagainst us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and\nmanagement personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future\ncoverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic\nconditions, which may harm our business.\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested\nand packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal\nyear 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of\nrisks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations, including:\ndomestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;\ndiffering legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;\ndomestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;\ndisruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and\n17\nTable of Contents\nnatural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic\nevents.\nAdverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital\nexpenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence\nand spending, periodically occur. More recently, increased inflation may impact supply, employee, facilities and\ninfrastructure costs. To the extent such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have\na material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial\nresults, including:\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us;\nour customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\ndifficulties in obtaining capital;\nreduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other\nmanufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations;\nlead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect\nour ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions\nand insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\nWe have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of Israel and\ncompanies with business in Israel have been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott. Other\ncountries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli\noperations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and\nvendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical. We\nhave facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind\ncoupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk. These\nmeasures can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers,\nincluding impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply\nchain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where\nwe, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience\nhigher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance\ncoverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary\ndepending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our\ninsurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which\ncould harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to\nclimate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and\npollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing\nprocesses or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital\nexpenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as\nwell as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance\ncosts that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by\nincreasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our\n18\nTable of Contents\noperations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the\nimplications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our\nstated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025,\nwhich could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also\nexperience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which\ncould result in increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face\ndecreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy\nefficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of\nour products, could negatively impact our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\nWe have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we\nbelieve will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives.\nAcquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our\nbusiness, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial\nresults. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to\nenter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely\ncomplete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable\nto pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022,\nNVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the\ncompletion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In\naddition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions\nmay be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they\ncould create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\nRisks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of\nthe acquired business;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or\nstrategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and\napprovals or financing;\nStock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\nlegal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in\nwhich we are investing or are acquiring; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of\nour acquisition or investment.\nSystem security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our\nexpected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or\nimplement adequate preventative measures.\nFor example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our\nnetwork by a group of independent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any government or political cause.\nThe threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and through deception, obtained two-factor authentication\ncapability and access to our network. The threat actors misappropriated certain NVIDIA proprietary information,\nincluding NVIDIA source code, and leaked some of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident,\nwe engaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further\nunauthorized access, hardened our network, analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and\nnotified law enforcement and other authorities.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nThreat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to\ncontinue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the third parties upon which\nwe rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we rely on products and services\nprovided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation,\ncloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which\nexposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and\ninfrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not\ncontain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology\nsystems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our\nservices. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not\nhave adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a\nsecurity breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their\nsystems, logs and other information related to the security breach.\nTo defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the\nevolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in our\nsecurity controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and\ntechniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may\nexperience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.\nBreaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of\nproprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties\naffected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent\nliability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. If we\nor a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security\nincident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting\nrequirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations,\nreputational harm, diversion of funds, financial\n20\nTable of Contents\nloss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell\nand distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower\nmargins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock\nprice and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water\nshortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence,\npolitical and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or\nman-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center\ncapacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical\nbusiness operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations\nvulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these\ngeographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical\ninfrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in\nwhich we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For\nexample, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our\nemployees or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of\nour assets in those regions. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing,\nlogistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water\nshortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental,\npublic health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs could increase, if\nthe conflict between Russia and Ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our\nfoundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other\nsuppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war\nor catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a\nresult of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume\noperations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating\nresults.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be\nadversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms\nthrough their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of\nthese partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to\npurchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing\npatterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel,\nchange or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or\ncustomers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our\npartners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of\nwhich may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant\nreduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are\nbeyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost\ninflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diverse\ntalent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could\nimpair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts,\nor if we cannot retain key employees, our business may be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in\nincreased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a\nresult of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly\ndependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning,\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic\nplanning and execution and long-term success.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation of these processes and systems is critical and they need to be scalable to support our growth, including\nfor acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to commence implementation\nof accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any\nERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued\nability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These\nchanges may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.\nFailure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remediate any material weakness,\nour financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to\nreport our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital\nmarkets may be restricted, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or\ninvestigation by regulatory authorities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners,\nvendors and suppliers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic\nand demand uncertainty, and the limited availability of our supply chain and logistical services, may have a\nmaterial net negative impact on our business and financial results. While COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales\nfor certain of our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. COVID-19 containment around\nthe world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations\ncould limit our capacity to meet customer demand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity\nand components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary\nlevels or at all, or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes.\nCOVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and\nmay continue to result in, disruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price\nand liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting\ndemand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as\nrequired by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.\nThere is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our\nability to perform critical functions could be harmed. When we begin to reopen our offices, we expect to incur\nincremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to\ntimely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. An extended period of\nglobal supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative\nimpact on our business, results of operations, and access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though\nthe full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described\nin these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but\nare not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of\nour products and services;\n22\nTable of Contents\nour ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;\nthe inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance over the\npurchasing credit extended to these customers, and customer bad debt write-offs;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial\nresults. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could\ncause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and\npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption;\nbusiness acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements;\ncompetition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and\nsafety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with\nsuch requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business\noperations negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and\nregulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that our employees,\ncontractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help\nensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal\nsanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to\nour reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we\ncould incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and\noperate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in\nanti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity resulting from\ngrowing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government\nbodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic\nsanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products,\nprovide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to\nchange from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on\nour business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain allies\nhave imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control\nmeasures, which have and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete restrictions on\nexports to and other commerce and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular\nentities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage\nof our products, services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, and restrict\naccess by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems,\nnegatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United\nStates and foreign government bodies, we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and\nprocedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions, our employees, contractors,\npartners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be\nultimately held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to\nvarious penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business,\noperating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the\nregions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and\nKorea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may\nresult in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties and economic disruptions\nthat could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability.\nThe increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory\nrestrictions that target products\n23\nTable of Contents\nand services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings.\nSuch restrictions could limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and\nfinancial results. Deemed export control limitations could negatively impact the ability of our research and\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nRecent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may\nadversely affect our Gaming business. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and\nenforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs,\nrestrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect\non our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and\nservices, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We\nare increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services. AI presents risks and challenges\nthat could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI poses emerging ethical issues and if we enable or\noffer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, or if we are unable to\ndevelop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and\nsystems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal\nliability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related\nresearch and development. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others\ncould undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational\nharm.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities\ncould result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and\nsuppliers to do business with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants,\nshareholders and customers have focused increasingly on the ESG and sustainability practices of companies,\nincluding those associated with climate change and human rights. These parties have placed increased importance on\nthe implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet shareholder or other\nindustry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and business\nactivities may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability\ndisclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including\ncorporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management,\nproduct quality, supply chain management, and talent diversity and inclusion practices. It is possible that\nstakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur\nadditional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, or\nchoose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing\ncustomers, due to our policies. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any\nsustainability disclosure could have a material negative impact on our reputation and business activities.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement. An\nunfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third\nparties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP\nrights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and\nresolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims\nare made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have\nto seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms\nacceptable to us. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could be subject to\nsubstantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products.\nWe may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not\nconcluded on commercially reasonable\n24\nTable of Contents\nterms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other\nindemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a\nresult, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be\nreduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously\nassess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be\ncertain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able\nto enforce such protections.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns relating to our\nproducts and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and\nservices, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information\nthat is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies,\ncontracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our\npractices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security\nor disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded,\ncould damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data\nin our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings,\ndisruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data\nprotection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nindividuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a\nproposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations and could require us\nto change our business practices.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For\nexample, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European\nCommission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data\nout of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of\nprotection, including the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border\npersonal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of doing business. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and\nnegatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to\nEuropean and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing\ncapabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\nThe United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows\nfor statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches. California’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or\nCPRA, which may restrict the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use\nof cross-contextual advertising techniques; restrict the retention of personal information; expand the types of\ndata breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to\nimpose administrative fines. Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado\nPrivacy Act, both of which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to new data\nprivacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could increase as we become subject to additional\nobligations.\nThe interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere\nare quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that\nis\n25\nTable of Contents\ninconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies,\nsystems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our\nefforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or\nare perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face\nsignificant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional\nreporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal\ndata. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax\nrates.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll,\nsales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various\nforeign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and\nexpenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for\nincome taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.\nFor example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019\nand under audit in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities\nmay disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase\nour worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or\ninternational tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including\nproposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a\nresult of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in\nfiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the\nTCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures\nover five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision,\nit will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent proposals to increase\nthe U.S. corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of\ninternational business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax\nrates. Numerous countries, as well as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax initiative and\nare considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax\nobligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business, which could\nmaterially impact our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in\njurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the\nresolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles,\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax\npurposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation\nallowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based\ncompensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the\nperiod in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in\nthe United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the\ndomestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of\nlimitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.\nFor example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple\nshareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and\nregulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or\nfines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or\nsettlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and\noverall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our\noperations. Our business is subject to laws and\n26\nTable of Contents\nregulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with\nchanges in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior\nnotes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to\nrefinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the\nnotes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial\npaper program.\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us\nto dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal\nrepayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability\nto obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other\npurposes; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or materially change our business.\nWe are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected\nby events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or\nlenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating\nagency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability\nto obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or\nprevent a change in control.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions\nthat could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These\nprovisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of\ndirectors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our\nshareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director\nnominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to develop and sell\ngraphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the\nagreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock,\nMicrosoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent\na change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire."

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11,\n2022, we had approximately 313 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nOn July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock, such that each stockholder of record\nat the close of business on June 21, 2021 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every\nshare held on the record date, or the Stock Split. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related\nshareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares for a\ntotal cost of $7.08 billion through January 30, 2022.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share\nrepurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other\nfactors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may\nbe suspended at any time at our discretion.\nWe did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022. As of January 30, 2022, we are authorized, subject to\ncertain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of\nfuture cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of all existing 349\nmillion treasury shares.

During fiscal year 2022, we\nwithheld approximately 8 million shares for a total value of $1.90 billion through net share settlements. Beginning\nwith the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in\ncapital, with withheld shares assuming the status of authorized and unissued shares.

                "content": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, AR and\nVR.\nOur two operating segments are \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September\n2020.\nDemand\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions,\ncompetitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and\nvolume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital\ncurrency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact\nof cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and\nnew cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand, and further impact\ndemand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards\nand processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for\nEthereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs,\nincrease returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have\nintroduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to\naddress demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly\nall our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to\ngamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our\ngaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-\nmining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired\noutcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for\nus to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more\npronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. In estimating demand and evaluating\ntrends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\nSupply\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires\nus to make estimates of customers’ future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between\nsupply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more\nuncertain. To\n30\nTable of Contents\nhave shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build finished products\nand maintain inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, anticipating demand that does not\nmaterialize, or for what we believe is pent-up demand. During fiscal year 2022, we made substantial strides in\nbroadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. We expect to remain supply-\nconstrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in Gaming and Networking. We have placed non-\ncancellable inventory orders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided\ndeposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. Ordering product in\nadvance of our historical lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may trigger excess inventory or\nother charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is\nserved by our competitors. Given our long lead times on inventory purchasing, demand may be perishable or may\ndisappear. Given our current long lead times, we may order components before our product design is finalized and\nchanges to the product design or end demand could trigger excess inventory. Our supply deliveries and production\nmay be non-linear within a quarter or year which could cause changes to expected revenue or cash flows.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022. Most of our employees continue to work remotely and we\nhave paused most business travel. During fiscal year 2022, our Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization\nmarket platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our\nProfessional Visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstations as enterprises support\nhybrid work environments. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume\nonsite services and related in-office costs.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers, the availability of supply chain,\nlogistical services and component supply, and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative\nimpact on our business and financial results.\nWe believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper\narrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt\nrepayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations.\nFiscal Year 2022 Summary\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,          January 31,\n2022                 2021       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                          26,914       $       16,675               Up 61%\nGross margin                                                 64.9  %              62.3  %            Up 260 bps\nOperating expenses              $                           7,434       $        5,864               Up 27%\nIncome from operations          $                          10,041       $        4,532               Up 122%\nNet income                      $                           9,752       $        4,332               Up 125%\nNet income per diluted share    $                            3.85       $         1.73               Up 123%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2022 was $26.91 billion, up 61% from a year ago.\nGaming revenue was up 61% from a year ago reflecting higher sales of GeForce GPUs. We continue to benefit from\nstrong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal\nyear 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new\ngames supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand\nfor new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in\ncryptocurrency mining.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAlthough nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are LHR to help direct GeForce GPUs to\ngamers, our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining. Gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency\nusing our GPUs, although we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility\nin the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying\ntransactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability\nto accurately estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is\nlikely to have in the future.\nData Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across\nboth training and inference for cloud computing and AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep\nrecommender models.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture\nproducts and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in\nworkloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.\nAutomotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in\nlegacy cockpit revenue.\nOEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for\nthe fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year.\nRevenue for our CMP products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We are unable to\nestimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above,\nis likely to have on future CMP sales.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-\nrelated charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins\nalso benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation,\ncompensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\nIncome from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share\nwere $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The\nincrease reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.\nWe paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nAt our November 2021 GPU Technology Conference, we announced general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise;\n65 new and updated software development kits, including NVIDIA Riva, Modulus, ReOpt, Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara\nHoloscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps switch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge\nAI and autonomous machines.\nIn our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop GeForce RTX 30 Series\nGPU line-ups; expanded the RTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA\nDLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a new high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW.\nIn our Data Center platform, we launched new NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs for mainstream AI, data analytics and\ngraphics; debuted a new class of NVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our\nfirst Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command\nand Fleet Command AI software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to\naddressing the global climate change crisis.\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop\nworkstations; and launched NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual\nworlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIn our Automotive platform, we unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan next-generation SOC; announced design wins with\nMercedes-Benz for the AI cockpit in its new EQS sedan; with Volvo Cars for the autonomous driving computer in its\nnext-generation cars, beginning with the XC90 in 2022; with energy vehicles from R-Auto, IM Motors, NIO, Faraday\nFuture, VinFast and Xpeng; with robotaxis including Cruise, Amazon Zoox, Pony.ai and AutoX; with autonomous\ntrucking companies Embark, Kodiak Robotics and Plus; formed a multi-year partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to\njointly develop and deliver next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled services and experiences;\nand announced that Desay, Flex, Quanta, Valeo and ZF are using the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform to manufacture\nsafe and secure AV systems for vehicle makers.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses\nand related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related\nto inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of\nthese critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit\nCommittee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments\ncompared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for\nexisting products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer\ndemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer\npurchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was\nan unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. As a fabless semiconductor\ncompany, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so,\nwe must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times are\nvery long and in some cases, extend on to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of\ncustomers’ future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our\nhistorical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to\nother market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions,\nand macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is\n33\nTable of Contents\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the\nstandalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a\nperformance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if\nindicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment\nreview process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.35 billion and the amount of goodwill\nallocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $361 million and $3.99 billion,\nrespectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of\nsignificant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities\nto each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but\nthat are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative\nassessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal\nyear 2021 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\nRevenue                                    100.0  %          100.0  %\nCost of revenue                             35.1              37.7\nGross profit                                64.9              62.3\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development                    19.6              23.5\nSales, general and administrative            8.0              11.6\nTotal operating expenses                    27.6              35.1\nIncome from operations                      37.3              27.2\nInterest income                              0.1               0.3\nInterest expense                            -0.9              -1.1\nOther, net                                   0.4               0.1\nOther income (expense), net                 -0.4              -0.7\nIncome before income tax expense            36.9              26.5\nIncome tax expense                           0.7               0.5\nNet income                                  36.2  %           26.0  %\n35\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,            $         %\n2022              2021       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nGraphics                $          15,868    $        9,834    $   6,034        61  %\nCompute & Networking               11,046             6,841        4,205        61  %\nTotal                   $          26,914    $       16,675    $  10,239        61  %\nGraphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We continue\nto benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue\nduring fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the\nrelease of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and\nstreaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end\nusers to engage in cryptocurrency mining.\nCompute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal\nyear 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud\ncomputing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical\nindustries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and\nthat fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP\ncontributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal\nyears 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the\nlocation to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a\ndifferent location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device\ncosts, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield\nfallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal\nyear 2022 was primarily due to lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory\nstep-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within\nGraphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of\ninventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years\n2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of\n0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\nThe gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021,\nprimarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs.\nThe gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year\n2021, primarily due to a shift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive\nsolutions.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,          January 31,               $         %\n2022                 2021          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           5,268       $        3,924       $   1,344        34  %\n% of net revenue                                  19.6  %              23.5  %\nSales, general and administrative                2,166                1,940             226        12  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                   8.0  %              11.6  %\nTotal operating expenses             $           7,434       $        5,864       $   1,570        27  %\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily\ndriven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher\ninfrastructure costs.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021,\nprimarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially\noffset by lower amortization of intangibles.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income\nwas $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was\nprimarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nInterest expense was $236 million and $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in\nexpense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated\nentities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during\nfiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains\nfrom our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our\ninvestments in non-affiliated entities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our\nannual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an\nincrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S.\nfederal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction,\nand the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the\nBritish Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess\ntax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time\nbenefits of the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to\nincome earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was\nlower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax\nbenefits related to stock-based compensation.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information, including the Domestication.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         1,990    $          847\nMarketable securities                              19,218            10,714\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        21,208    $       11,561\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $         9,108    $        5,822\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $        -9,830    $      -19,675\nactivities\nNet cash provided by financing              $         1,865    $        3,804\nactivities\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of\n$9.65 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed\nincome securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our\nportfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net\nincome, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by\nprepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and increases in trade receivables due to higher\nrevenue.\nCash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021,\nreflecting lower payments in acquiring businesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021,\nand higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by higher purchases of marketable\nsecurities.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021,\nwhich primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock\nunits.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash\ngenerated by our operations. As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional supply. We\ncontinuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we\ncan finance our future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and\nits agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These\nmarketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and\nthe cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to\nproperty and equipment.\nWe have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for\nwhich we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than\nthat, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of\nJanuary 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nFollowing the Domestication, we\n38\nTable of Contents\nhave utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in\nhigher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA\nrequires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over\nfive years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and result in\nsignificantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nIn fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of\nfuture cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of\nour common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year\n2022.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding:\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024;\n$1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026;\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028;\n$1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030;\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2031;\n$1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040;\n$2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050; and\n$500 million of Notes Due 2060.\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 30, 2022, we\nhad not issued any commercial paper.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $729 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $59 million\nrecorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing\nof any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the\nunderlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently\nunder examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ninformation.\nFor a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12,\nNote 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, respectively.\nClimate Change\nRefer to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Environmental, Social and Corporate\nGovernance activities. To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with\nglobal sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business\ntrends. There are no material current climate change regulations impacting us, however, we are monitoring potential\nregulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other\njurisdictions. We believe that climate change has not had a material impact to our revenue to date. We have not\nexperienced any significant physical effects of climate change to date on our operations and results, nor any\nsignificant impacts on the cost or availability of insurance. In fiscal year 2023, we plan to build Earth-2, an AI\nsupercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of Renewable Energy\nCredits.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements."

                "content": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis,\nparallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor,\nwould result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million, or an increase in fair value for\nthese investments of $22 million, respectively.\nAt January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less\nunamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no\nfinancial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of\nforeign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years\n2022 and 2021.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have\ninternational operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses\nbenefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our\noperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge\nrelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are\nrecognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in\nother income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been approximately $103 million and $84 million lower as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset\na corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $41 million and $44 million as of January 30,\n2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense),\nnet by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,\nassuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\n40\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information."

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable\nassurance.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n30, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 30,\n2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system,\nwhich will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nthe Company’s financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases with the\nconsolidated financial reporting and general ledger module to be implemented in fiscal year 2023. We will evaluate\neach quarter whether there are changes that affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected."

We also have audited the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2022 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n45\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory\nprovisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess\ninventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 30, 2022, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $2,605 million.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including\ndeveloping assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over\nmanagement’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating\nthe appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the\napproach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market\nconditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating\nwhether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including\nhistorical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in\ntechnology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nMarch 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND

Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement\ncosts, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates\nconsider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of\nthe software, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to\nsubscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services\nbased on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from oneto three yearsfor products in order to\nrepair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes\nthe estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for\nknown warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or\nESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.\nStock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we\nestimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in\nsubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or\nsubstantial\n53\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nsettlement payments or judgements. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any\nof our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss\nassociated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in\nany such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to\nrecord additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary\nassets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary\nassets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses\nrelated to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses\nfrom foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date\nhave not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $ 907million related to state and certain other deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method,\nthe effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for\nperiods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as\navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized\ngains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity,\nnet of\n54\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\ntax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the\nsale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other\nincome (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAll of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair\nvalue of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more\nlikely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost\nbasis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of\nour Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\nequity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative\ninstruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in\nearnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to\nthe risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative\ninstruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it\ncreates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for\nnoncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts\nconsistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally threeto five years. Once an asset is\nidentified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and\nassets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a\nqualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are\nnot limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable\nmultiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates\nregarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process\nresearch and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology\nlicenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods\nranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the\nintangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a\nstraight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an\nindefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible\nasset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nexceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be\ndisposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the\nfair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,\nbut our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions\nused in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows, discount rate used\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nto determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to\none year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with\nthe corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the\nfair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded\nto our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nonly if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded\nthrough net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities\nby the investee.\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and\nrealized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to require that an\nacquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance\nwith Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We early adopted this accounting\nstandard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the impact was immaterial.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $ 1.36billion charge in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September\n2020.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\nIn April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase\nconsideration of $ 7.13billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing,\nstorage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the\nentire computing, networking, and storage stack.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\nPurchase Price\nCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares    $  7,033\n(1)\nCash for Mellanox equity awards (2)                         16\nTotal cash consideration                                 7,049\nFair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by             85\nNVIDIA (3)\nTotal purchase consideration                          $  7,134\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents                             $    115\nMarketable securities                                      699\nAccounts receivable, net                                   216\nInventories                                                320\nPrepaid expenses and other assets                          179\nProperty and equipment, net                                144\nGoodwill                                                 3,431\nIntangible assets                                        2,970\nAccounts payable                                          -136\nAccrued and other current liabilities                     -236\nIncome tax liability                                      -191\nDeferred income tax liability                             -258\nOther long-term liabilities                               -119\n$  7,134\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately\n56million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249thousand Mellanox stock options held\nby employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices.\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non the estimated fair values.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.\nGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim\nindicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax\npurposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment.\nRefer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021\nsince the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal\nyear 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration.\nAcquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28million were included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as\nfollows:\nFair Value\n(In millions)    Useful Lives\nDeveloped technology (1)                    $          1,640    5 years\nCustomer relationships (2)                               440    3 years\nOrder backlog (3)                                        190    Based on actual shipments\nTrade names (4)                                           70    5 years\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible               2,340\nassets\nIPR&D (5)                                                630    N/A\nTotal identified intangible assets          $          2,970\n(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without\nMethod.\n(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-\nPeriod Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-\nRoyalty Method under the income approach.\n(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the\npattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox has an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset\nof $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not amortized. Instead, the project is\ntested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be\nimpaired or may have reached technological feasibility.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and\nrestated, or the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other\nstock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options.\nAs of January 30, 2022, up to 50million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted\nunder the 2007 Plan, of which 6million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All\noptions are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant\nRSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 30, 2022, there were 131million\nshares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject to\ncontinued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant\nand 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 40%\nvesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly\nthereafter. PSUs vest over a four-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined\ndate that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based\nPSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares\nsubject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation\nCommittee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently\namended and restated, or the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately\n24months, which is generally divided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased\nunder our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the\ncommencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within\nthe offering. As of January 30, 2022, we had 233million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\nNumber of Shares            Weighted Average\n(In millions, except per share data)       Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalances, January 31, 2021                                                     59    $                  66.17\nGranted                                                                        18    $                 190.69\nVested restricted stock                                                       -29    $                  66.67\nCanceled and forfeited                                                         -2    $                  86.47\nBalances, January 30, 2022                                                     46    $                 114.19\nVested and expected to vest after                                              46    $                 113.84\nJanuary 30, 2022\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, there were 131million and 148million shares, respectively, of common\nstock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $\n1.38billion, with an average exercise price of $ 3.55per share and an average remaining term of 1.1years.

These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains\nor losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to\noperating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nThe fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.

The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without\nleave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an\nappeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral\nargument is scheduled for May 10, 2022.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation , was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and\ninternal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain\nofficers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading,\nmisappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange\nAct based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n72\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal                  $           482    $          197    $           65\nState                                 42                 1                 4\nForeign                               71               161                87\nTotal current                        595               359               156\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal                             -420              -246                 2\nForeign                               14               -36                16\nTotal deferred                      -406              -282                18\nIncome tax expense       $           189    $           77    $          174\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nDomestic (1)                $         8,446    $        1,437    $          620\nForeign                               1,495             2,972             2,350\nIncome before income tax    $         9,941    $        4,409    $        2,970\n(1) Fiscal year 2022 domestic income before income tax increased as compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 due to\nthe Domestication in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of\n21% to income before income taxes as follows:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nTax expense computed at federal           $         2,088    $          926    $          624\nstatutory rate\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal tax                 42                10                12\neffect\nForeign-derived intangible income                    -520                 —                 —\nForeign tax rate differential                        -497              -561              -301\nStock-based compensation                             -337              -136               -60\nU.S. federal R&D tax credit                          -289              -173              -110\nIP domestication                                     -244                 —                 —\nOther                                                 -54                11                 9\nIncome tax expense                        $           189    $           77    $          174\nThe tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are presented below:\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\n-In millions\nDeferred tax assets:\nResearch and other tax credit           $           798    $          650\ncarryforwards\nProperty, equipment and intangible                  530                32\nassets\nGILTI deferred tax assets                           378               709\nAccruals and reserves, not currently                258                59\ndeductible for tax purposes\nOperating lease liabilities                         125               120\nNet operating loss carryforwards                    118               100\nStock-based compensation                             86                36\nOther deferred tax assets                            22                 —\nGross deferred tax assets                         2,315             1,706\nLess valuation allowance                           -907              -728\nTotal deferred tax assets                         1,408               978\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAcquired intangibles                               -169              -191\nUnremitted earnings of foreign                     -150              -111\nsubsidiaries\nOperating lease assets                             -113              -111\nGross deferred tax liabilities                     -432              -413\nNet deferred tax asset (1)              $           976    $          565\n(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 1.22billion and $ 806million and long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities of $ 245million and $ 241million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognized income tax expense of $ 189million, $ 77million, and $ 174million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and\n2020 respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9%, 1.7%, and 5.9% for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was\nprimarily due to an\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nincrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S.\nfederal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and\nthe discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared\nto fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States\ntax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nOn June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP\nto the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more\nclosely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax\nlaws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit\nprimarily from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 244million in fiscal\nyear 2022.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the\nBritish Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess\ntax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time\nbenefits of the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the\ntax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and\nexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the\nacquisition, we recorded $ 256million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over\nthe tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also\nrecorded $ 153million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.05billion and $ 232million of\ncumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We\nhave not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these\ninvestments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $ 907million and $ 728million,\nrespectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be\nrealized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax\nbenefits during the period.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 397million, $\n345million and $ 341million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year\n2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 341million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of\nJanuary 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 102million that will begin to expire in\nfiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.24billion, of which $ 1.18billion is\nattributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 55million is attributable to\nvarious other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other\nauthoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign\nnet operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and\nother limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such\nlimitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable,\nmay expire or be denied before utilization.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $ 1.01billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 808million would affect\nour effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 181million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state\nincome tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that\nwould likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 808million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January\n30, 2022 consisted of $ 670million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $ 138million reflected as a net\nreduction to the deferred tax assets.\n75\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period            $           776    $          583    $          477\nIncreases in tax positions for current                246               158               104\nyear\nIncreases in tax positions for prior                   14                60                 7\nyears (1)\nDecreases in tax positions for prior                   -4               -11                 —\nyears\nSettlements                                            -8                -5                 —\nLapse in statute of limitations                       -11                -9                -5\nBalance at end of period                  $         1,013    $          776    $          583\n(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the\nMellanox acquisition.\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we\nanticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt\nof cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of\nJanuary 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and January 26, 2020, we had accrued $ 59million, $ 44million, and $ 31million,\nrespectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included\nas a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits of $ 670million\nand the related interest and penalties of $ 59million are included in non-current income taxes payable.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 30, 2022, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on\nsuch tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 30,\n2022, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong,\nIndia, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2021. As of January 30,\n2022, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, India,\nIsrael, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.\nNote 15 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nThrough January 30, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04billion shares under our share repurchase program\nfor a total cost of $ 7.08billion. As of January 30, 2022, we have a remaining authorization, subject to certain\nspecifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24billion through December 2022. From January\n31, 2022 through March 17, 2022, we repurchased 7.7million shares of our common stock for $ 1.75billion.\nDuring fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid $ 399million, $ 395million, and $ 390million in cash dividends to\nour shareholders, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of our existing\n349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The\nexcess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings,\nresulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $ 20million and retained earnings by $ 12.0billion. Any\nfuture repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.\n76\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 168million, $ 120million, and $ 76million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance.\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and\nOmniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.\nOur Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing;\nMellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements,\nand autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nand other software.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute &\nNetworking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include\nstock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related\ncosts, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment.

                "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Company\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data\nscience, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films.\nToday, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel\nprocessing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning\nalgorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as\nthe brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep\nlearning is being adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been\nimmensely difficult with traditional coding. Some of the most recent applications of GPU-powered deep learning\ninclude recommendation systems, which are AI algorithms trained to understand the preferences, previous decisions,\nand characteristics of people and products using data gathered about their interactions, large language models,\nwhich can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained\nfrom massive datasets, and generative AI, which uses algorithms that create new content, including audio, code,\nimages, text, simulations, and videos, based on the data they have been trained on.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services\nto create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse,\nwe address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable\nnature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying\ntechnology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and\npartners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases\nthe value of our platform to our customers.\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $37 billion in research and development since our inception,\nyielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern\ncomputer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA\nprogramming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU for general purpose computing.\nThis approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in\nfields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today,\nour GPUs and networking accelerate many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively\nparallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine\nlearning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace\ndescribed by Moore’s Law, NVIDIA accelerated computing delivers performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s\nLaw, giving the industry a path forward.\nGamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the\nworld’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-\nquality live video gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is\nexpanding because of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.\nResearchers and developers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating\nmolecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 2,800 applications - including 23 of the top\n25 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to\nmaterials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers over\n70% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 23 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe world’s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our GPUs and broader data\ncenter-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions\nof end-users, including search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI\nassistants, navigation, and cloud computing.\nA rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and software\nto bring automation to the products and services they build.

NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can solve complex\nproblems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches.\nIndeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance\nleaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect,\nand software layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance\nadvantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them\nwith a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CUDA and networking technologies as the fundamental\nbuilding blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research\nand development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with shared underlying technology by using\na variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. We utilize this\nplatform approach in each of our target markets.\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing\nplatform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs,\ninterconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely\nsuited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our\nleadership position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous\ncycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI\nsupercomputer. There are 3.8 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy\nour technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and over\n13,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on\nthe latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated\ncomputing platform.\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics is\nfundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources\nto enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications, and create\nnew virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as\ndevelopers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform.\nOur computer graphics platforms leverage not only our industry-leading GeForce and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, but also\noptimized software stacks. For example, GeForce Experience enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their\nPC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate\na number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world\nsimulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design\napplications. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design\nsoftware - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for\nenterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.\nAdvancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the\ntransportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms\nrequired for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-\ncoded approaches and will use multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally\nsafe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to\nmarket through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or\n8\nTable of Contents\nOEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the\nneural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-\nthe-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the\ntransportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our\ncustomers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities\ndirectly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development\narrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\nSales and Marketing\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-\nperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our\nglobal markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our\npartner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system\nbuilders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, ISVs, internet and CSPs, automotive\nmanufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of\napplication engineers and solution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying\nsystem designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key\nto improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering\nrelationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products\nwithin each platform.\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and\nmaintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage\nwith key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product\nrequirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior\nto launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game\ntitles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for\ndevelopers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that\nleverage our platforms.\nAs NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to\nplatforms, systems and software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in\nour partner network, certain of our products are also sold direct to CSPs, enterprise customers, retail channels\nand consumers.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers,\nprofessional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half\nof our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for\nnotebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker\nrevenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2023, our supply exceeded our demand in several areas, and\nour revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy,\nwhereby we employ key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly,\ntesting, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the\nInternational Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and\nassurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated\nwith owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products, such as memory, substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible\nfor procurement of most of the raw materials used in the\n9\nTable of Contents\nproduction of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality\nassurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product\ncomponents in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and\ncapacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations. We utilize\nsuppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce\nour semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers, such as Amkor\nTechnology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., or BYD Auto, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., or Hon Hai, King Yuan Electronics Co.,\nLtd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform\nassembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex\nLtd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter\ncard products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our networking cables. We purchase substrates from\nIbiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from\nMicron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or\nmaterials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and\nconfiguration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc. and\nChroma ATE Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto and Hon Hai,\ndistributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel,\nand the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test\nspecifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs,\nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some\nof our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and\nmay be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment\nin the future.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other\naccelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD,\nand Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing chips and software that incorporate accelerated or\nAI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc.,\nAmazon, Inc., and Baidu, Inc.;\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms;\n10\nTable of Contents\nsuppliers of SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming\ndevices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas\nElectronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use,\nsuch as Tesla, Inc.; and\nsuppliers of interconnect, switch cable solutions, and DPUs such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista\nNetworks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks,\nInc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud\nservices companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\nissued patents have expiration dates from March 2023 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and\npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government announced new license requirements that impact\ncertain exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of some of our data center products. The impact\nof the new license requirements is difficult to quantify, and it may be challenging for us to manage our operations\nand forecast our operating results due to these requirements. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to\nRegulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nAdditionally, our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such\nregulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a\nmaterial impact on our business. In February 2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by\nwhich we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the\ntransaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,\nresults of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI,\n11\nTable of Contents\nclimate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and\notherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in\nsubsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate\nsound environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the\nCompany. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing\nand discussing with management our practices related to ESG. We assess our programs annually in consideration of\nstakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our\ncontinued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and\npractices. More information can be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website and in our annual\nCorporate Responsibility Report, or CR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CR Report is\nnot incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or\nthe SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks,\nincluding current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn our CR Report published in July 2022, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year\n2022. Fiscal year 2023 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2024. There has been\nno material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with\nglobal sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year\n2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for\nour offices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs\nare inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput,\nperformance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued\nstrong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 30 most energy\nefficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the November 2022 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will\nenable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate\nchange and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had 26,196 employees in 35 countries, 19,532 were engaged in\nresearch and development and 6,664 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and\nhave been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted strong talent globally with our\ndifferentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive and diverse recruits. The COVID-19\npandemic created expanded hiring opportunities in new geographies and provided increased\n12\nTable of Contents\nflexibility for employees to work from locations of their choice. Our workforce is about 80% technical and about\n50% hold advanced degrees.\nEarlier in fiscal year 2023, we slowed our hiring to focus on our current employees and manage costs. We maintain a\nconnection for global talent from universities through on-campus collaborations with professors and student\norganizations, as well as engagement with technical organizations and participation at industry conferences. Our\nown employees help to surface top talent, with over 37% of our new hires in fiscal year 2023 coming from employee\nreferrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops,\npanel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common development needs and\nconstantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and\ntechnologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced\ncertifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental\nactivities and internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development\nprograms for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for\nfuture advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize\nareas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts\nabout making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the\nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come\nand stay. In fiscal year 2023, our overall turnover rate was 5.3%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour shareholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and\nfinancial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee\nstock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-\nmanagement challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the\nregions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including\nassistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those\nwho wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or managing current talent, we focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining a more\ndiverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women,\nBlack/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\nPartnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\nAssigning dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process;\n13\nTable of Contents\nEmbedding inclusion recruiting partners throughout the business to help align candidates with internal\nopportunities;\nSupporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;\nProviding peer support and executive sponsors for nine internal community resource groups;\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for\ndiversity;\nEnsuring we have and review a diverse pool of candidates for requisitions; and\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of\nour workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nHealth and COVID-19\nWe supported our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority during fiscal year 2023\nand throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our workforce safe.\nHybrid Working Environment\nWe support a hybrid work environment, understanding that many employees want the flexibility to work in the office\nor from home, and make that decision based on the conditions around them at any point in time.\nSteps we took to support employees working from home include:\nHome-focused health and well-being programs;\nLearning and development resources on how to work, lead and manage remotely; and\nOpportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days”\nfor employees to recharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of\nFebruary 17, 2023:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       60    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\n15\nTable of Contents\nCompetition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology reduces our control over product quantity and quality,\nmanufacturing yields, development, enhancement, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and can damage\nour business.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nInternational operations are a significant part of our business, and economic, political, business, and other\nchanges in the regions in which we operate may expose us to risks that could harm our business.\nProduct, system security, and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect\nour financial condition, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations and financial results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets.\nA significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of customers and could be adversely affected if\nwe lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees.\nModification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business,\nprocesses and internal controls.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results\nare below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and political and other actions, which may adversely\nimpact our business.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance\nresponsibilities could result in financial, reputational and operational harm.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational and\nfinancial harm and liability.\nAdequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are\nunsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other\nobligations. Privacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter\ncustomers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates and\nother tax-related factors.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nDelaware law, provisions in our governing documents, and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive\nproducts, and industry standards.\nOur success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance existing products and\ntechnologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry\nstandards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products\ndeveloped by other companies;\ndevelop new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including standalone software, cloud solutions, and software-,\ninfrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety and compliance standards;\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\ndevelop, acquire, and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including\nour acquisitions integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity;\nand\ncomplete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.\nWe invest in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce\nmeaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies,\nor if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins\nmay involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that\ncustomers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from\nobtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we\nbring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our\nfinancial results may be harmed.\nWe will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples\nof these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI\nmodels, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host\nthese services in their data centers, and we entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of\nfiscal year 2023 to support these offerings and our research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services\nmay not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone\nsoftware solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and\nseveral other software solutions. These new\n17\nTable of Contents\nbusiness models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or\nas-a-service solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these\nofferings.\nCompetition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products,\nservices and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or\nprovide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower than\nexpected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have\nlonger operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new\ndesigns and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These\ncompetitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and\ncapitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products,\nand secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could\nharm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to\nsome of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may\noffer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish\nmarket share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which\nwould cause our revenue to decline.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long\nmanufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply\ndeliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are\nultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, there could be a significant mismatch between\nsupply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our\nmarket platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past\nentered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure\nsufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs or our long-term demand expectations may change.\nAdditionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties\nthat are necessary for the finished product are not available. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor\nindustry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We\nhave previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits\nto secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not\nhave the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\nDemand for our products is based on many factors in addition to the lead times described above that have caused\nand/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our\nproducts, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume\nof our revenue, including:\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local\nhealth issues;\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\ntime to market;\n18\nTable of Contents\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and AI cloud service\nofferings;\nthe demand for cryptocurrency mining; or\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage.\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown\nsignificantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of\nour total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with\ndemand for our products.\nOur demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are\ncomplex and frequently negatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products\nsimultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture\ntransitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may impair our ability to predict\ndemand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions\nand channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can\ncreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand\nfor current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple\nproduct architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. While we have managed prior\nproduct transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned\nfor any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nWe sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers.\nAs a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing\nmarket conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to\nimpact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various\ndownstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-\ntime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a\ntimely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do\nso in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we\nfail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we\ncould lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose\nto purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase\ncommitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel\npricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of\nfuture demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products\nin the future. We have also written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments.\nThese impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in\nadvance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future\nproducts. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a\ngreater portion of our total supply while our\n19\nTable of Contents\nrevenue has sequentially declined. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial\nresults.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples\ninclude our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates\nfor these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we\nmay not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and\nregional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as\nthose involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,\ncontract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material\nadverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use\ncases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent\nspikes and drops in demand. For example, a number of years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital\ncurrency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact\nof cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new\ncryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in\nthe future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nrecently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create\nincreased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand\nfor our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining\ncapability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. With the\nEthereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new\nproducts or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes\ndemand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and\ndistribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that\nleverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content\navailable on our platforms such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers to build applications that leverage our\nplatforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable\nterms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our\nproducts reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and\nproduct delivery schedules and could harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We\ndo not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely\non third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products\nor product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from\nour products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. We face several risks which have\nadversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain,\nnegatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and\ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or in a timely manner;\n20\nTable of Contents\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and\ntest providers, and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change\na supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products\nwithout our qualification;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply\nin advance;\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology; and\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves or other natural\ndisasters and electricity conservation efforts.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage\nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product offerings are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain\ndefects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of\nissues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our\nproducts are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released.\nThese risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our\nproducts, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. Although arrangements with component\nproviders may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the\ncustomer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services\nhave been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or\nexpose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that\ncould attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead\nto substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs\nand automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect\nmay cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or\notherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues\nmay not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases, or related\nsoftware drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance,\nloss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, and harm to our relationships with\nexisting and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn\nnegatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to\nreimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or\nin connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFor example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This\ndefect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components\nand finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during\nfiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for\nwarranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be\nincorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if\nthe alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost\nof defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel\nand harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be\nunavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, higher\ninterest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases\nin unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past and/or could in the\nfuture have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively\nimpacted our gross margin and may continue to do so;\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which\nhave reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’\ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensing parties; reduced profitability may also\ncause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially\ncease operations; lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could\nadversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions\nand insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\nInternational operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to us to risks that could harm\nour business.\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested\nand packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 69% of our revenue during\nfiscal year 2023 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number\nof risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and\npolitical conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government\nlockdowns to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues, differing legal standards with\nrespect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic and international business and cultural practices\nthat differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations, and natural\ndisasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.\n22\nTable of Contents\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations,\nreduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our\nreputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or\nimplement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nThreat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to\ncontinue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other\nmajor conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-\nattacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. Furthermore, we rely on\nproducts and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including\nwithout limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other\nfunctions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third\nparties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that\nthey do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information\ntechnology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that\nsupport our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and\nthese may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party\nsuppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct\naccess to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. Additionally, we are\nincorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or\nservices are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could\nresult in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the\nevolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While\nwe take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to\ndetect all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have\ninstalled, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident\nhas occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address\nidentified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm.\nWe hold confidential and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of\nour security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary\ninformation or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to\na risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability,\nregulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our\nbusiness. For example, we hold propriety game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of\nour GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse\nof this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If\nwe or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to\nhave experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement\nactions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation,\nindemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial loss, loss of data, material\ndisruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and\nservices, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a\nresult of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n23\nTable of Contents\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs .\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water\nshortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence,\npolitical and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or\nman-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center\ncapacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical\nbusiness operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations\nvulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these\ngeographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical\ninfrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in\nwhich we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide\ngeopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where\nthe manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in\nchanging regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies,\nproduct demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted\nand may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales\nsupport operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our\noperations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are\ndisrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology\nsystem failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.\nThe ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in\ncertain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-\nparty systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue,\nincreases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks\nand conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and\nvendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical,\nand certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind\ncoupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which\ncan have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including\nimpairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and\ncritical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our\ncustomers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher\nattrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety\nof property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability\nand cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be\nunable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater\ndirect costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw\nmaterials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and\nhigher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and\nrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter\nour operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the\nimplications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our\nstated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025,\nwhich could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional,\n24\nTable of Contents\nunexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays\narising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face\ndecreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy\nefficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of\nour products, could negatively impact our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and\ntechnologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or\ninvestments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a\nparticular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our\nother strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to\nretain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and\nother changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact\nour business. For example, in February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing\nthe completion of the transaction. We recorded in operating expenses a $1.35 billion charge in fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce\nthe ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate\nacquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold\ninvestments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to\nthe value of the investment.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating\nand retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or\nstrategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and\napprovals or financing;\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\nlegal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n25\nTable of Contents\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in\nwhich we are investing or are acquiring; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products,\ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and\ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our\nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be\nadversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms\nthrough their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of\nthese partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to\npurchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing\npatterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel,\nchange or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or\ncustomers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our\npartners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of\nwhich may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant\nreduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade\nrestrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are\nbeyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost\ninflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit\nregulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation,\nand in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the\nretentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services\nof our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and\nsmooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and\nlong-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. In fiscal year 2023, we\ncontinued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource\nplanning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming\nerrors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report\nour financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial\ndemands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material\nweakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the\ncapital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation\nby regulatory authorities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our\ncustomers, partners, vendors and suppliers. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create\nsupply chain and logistics constraints, and COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among\nother areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated\nas the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in China. End customer\nsales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if\nlockdowns return. COVID-19 has also resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption of and volatility in\nglobal financial markets, which could impact overall technology spending or negatively affect our stock price and\nliquidity. All of these factors have had or could in the future have a material negative impact on our business.\nWe modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, including with respect to flexible work\nand social distancing measures, and we may take further actions as required by government regulations or in the\nbest interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. These and other measures have caused and may in\nthe future cause us to incur incremental expenses and costs.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to\ntimely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. The impact of COVID-19\ncan also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described\nin these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but\nare not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of\nour products and services;\nour ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required\npayments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for these customers and their extended payment terms, and customer\nbad debt write-offs;\nour vendors' payment requirements;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated future financial\nresults. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers,\nparticularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have\nrequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These\narrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. Failure to meet our expectations or\nthe expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in\nthe past, or experience substantial price volatility.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and\npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations;\ncybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our\ncompetitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our\nproducts. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance\nwith such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules\nand regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to\nmaterially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply\nour products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes\nor increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from\nregulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public\nconcern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their\ninterpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or\nincrease to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory\nactions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.\nAdditionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate\ncould negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government\nbodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic\nsanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products,\nprovide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to\nchange from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on\nour business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar\napplicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various\npenalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business,\noperating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic\nsanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia,\nBelarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business\noperations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue to\ndo so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions\nthat target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in\nadditional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could include\nadditional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited\nto AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and\nassociated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S.\nand its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls\nmay be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one\nor more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and\nwarehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad\nand could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting\nGPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our ability to export our\ntechnology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a\ncompetitive disadvantage for us and\n28\nTable of Contents\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact\ndemand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Additional unilateral\nor multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the\nability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nAdditional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to\nprovide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our\nrevenue.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new export restrictions and\nexport licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions\nimpact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce,\nand manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our\nA100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated\ncircuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving\ncertain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes\nthose circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking\nproducts, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China.\nWe are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), which could be costly and time\nconsuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our\nrevenue, during any such transition period.\nWe have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license\nrequirements, such as our new A800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new\nlicense requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant any\nexemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The new requirements\nmay have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who\nsell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and\ncompetitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings,\nif customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable\nto provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a\ntimely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess inventory,\nharming our results. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose\nburdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our\ncompetitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more\ncumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including\nsemiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to\ngames may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely\naffect our Data Center revenue.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our environmental, social and governance\nresponsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of\ncustomers and suppliers to do business with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have\nplaced increased importance on the implications of the social and environmental cost of their investments and these\nparties, as well as government regulators, have focused increasingly on corporate ESG and sustainability practices\nand disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied\nwith our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. Additionally, our ESG practices, oversight of ESG practices,\nor disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator, or other industry stakeholder expectations, or\nwe may fail to meet sustainability disclosure or ESG reporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and\nrequire additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, choose not to conduct\nbusiness with potential\n29\nTable of Contents\ncustomers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may\nnegatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in\nreputational and financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services\nmay result in reputational and financial harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such\nissues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services. AI poses emerging\nethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we\nenable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI\nsolutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy,\nemployment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal\npolicies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through\nour sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance\nwith government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development,\nand changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change\nour business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address concerns relating\nto the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our\nproducts and services or cause reputational harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could\ninclude significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost\nprofits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless\nof their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they\nmay also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to\ninfringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP\nrights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, on acceptable terms or at all, we could\nbe subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of\nour products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these\narrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result,\nthe value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We\nalso may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where\nto seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our\napplications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations.\nPrivacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and\npotential customers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe may process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security\nlaws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern\nthe processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use\n30\nTable of Contents\nof our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal\ninformation or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our\nreputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our\npossession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption\nof our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows\nfor statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, became operative in 2023, and restricts the use of\ncertain categories of sensitive personal information; further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising\ntechniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands the types of data breaches subject to the\nprivate right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose administrative\nfines for noncompliance. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation\nwhich differ from the CPRA and each become effective in 2023. Similar laws are being considered in several other\nstates, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted\nmeasures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become\nsubject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning\ndata protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nclasses of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could\nimpose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our\nbusiness practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to\nthe United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border\npersonal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries\noutside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities\nto validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to\nprovide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. While the European Union and United States\ngovernments have recently announced an agreement in principle on a new bilateral cross-border transfer mechanism,\nit is uncertain whether this agreement will be overturned in court like the previous two European Union-United\nStates bilateral cross-border transfer agreements. These mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is\nno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States.\nOther jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local\npersonal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could\nresult in fines from regulators. For example, China law imposes various requirements relating to data processing\nand data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China law, including personal data, may not be\ntransferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or\nCAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments,\ncould cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China, or impact our ability to transfer\ndata outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and\nnegatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to\nEuropean, China, and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing\ncapabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies\nfrom transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer\nlimitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply\nwith such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example,\n31\nTable of Contents\ncertain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual\nrestrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and\nif a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to\nlitigation, regulatory action, or fines. We may publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements,\nsuch as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security.\nIf these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair,\nor misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or\nother adverse consequences.\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate\nchanges to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process\npersonal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security\nobligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions,\nlitigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to\ndestroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,\nbusiness, or financial condition.\nWe have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than\nexpected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other\ntax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are\ncurrently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and undergoing tax\naudits in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome\ncould increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business,\nand harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business.\nThese include changes to U.S. tax laws and regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15%\nminimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us\nin fiscal year 2023. It is possible that these changes, or other tax law changes, could increase our future tax\nliability or cause other adverse impacts. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant\nportion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates\nincrease or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and\ncash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise\nas a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development, or OECD. The OECD recommended changes to long-standing tax principles and continues to\ndevelop new proposals, including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and\nestablishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty\nand adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives,\ncredits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of tax audits, changes in\naccounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not\ndeductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation\nallowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business\ncombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure.\nFurthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may\nsignificantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may\nresult in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely\naffect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to\n32\nTable of Contents\nour business. For example, we are defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from\nmultiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and\nregulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or\nfines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or\nsettlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-\nconsuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior\nnotes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we\nmay receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial\ncondition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a\nsubstantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our\nflexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and\nrestrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially\nchange our business.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we\nbreach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness\nmay be declared immediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and\nliquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such\nfinancing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to\ncreate and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without\nprior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting\nrequirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with\nMicrosoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock,\nMicrosoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent\na change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire."

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 17,\n2023, we had approximately 344 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase\nadditional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Since the inception of our share\nrepurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.10 billion shares for a total cost of $17.12 billion\nthrough January 29, 2023. During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 63 million shares for $10.04 billion. As of\nJanuary 29, 2023, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up\nto $7.23 billion through December 2023.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in\ncompliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and\nother factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the\nprogram may be suspended at any time at our discretion.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we paid $398 million in quarterly cash dividends.

                "content": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics,\nmetaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nSupply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown\nsignificantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of\nour total supply. Inventory provisions for excess inventory and purchase obligations totaled $2.17 billion in\nfiscal year 2023. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with\ndemand for our products.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we\nand our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture\nof our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of\nnew product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. While we have managed prior product\ntransitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples\ninclude our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates\nfor these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we\nmay not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications.\nNVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings\nWe will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples\nof these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI\nmodels, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host\nthese services in their data centers.\nWe entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to these offerings and\nour research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time,\nresources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI\nEnterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and several other software solutions. These new business\nmodels or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or as-a-\nservice solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\n36\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced new license requirements that, with certain\nexceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated\ncircuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. We\nare required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), including research and\ndevelopment and supply and distribution operations. We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative\nproducts not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and\ncompetitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings,\nif customers purchase product from competitors, or if customers develop their own internal solution, if the USG\ndoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant\ntransition costs.\nCOVID-19\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We incurred incremental expenses and related in-office\ncosts as we ramped onsite services.\nRestrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19\ncontainment efforts in China. During fiscal year 2023, end customer sales for our products in China have been\nnegatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if lockdowns return. COVID-19-related disruptions\nhave created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand\ncould become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis.\nRussia\nIn fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and later in the year, we closed business operations in\nRussia. Direct sales to Russia in fiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our revenue to partners that sell into Russia\nmay have been negatively impacted due to the war in Ukraine.\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the\ntransaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\nFiscal Year 2023 Summary\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,          January 30,\n2023                 2022       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                        26,974       $       26,914       —       %\nGross margin                                               56.9  %              64.9  %            Down 8.0 pts\nOperating expenses              $                        11,132       $        7,434               Up 50%\nIncome from operations          $                         4,224       $       10,041               Down 58%\nNet income                      $                         4,368       $        9,752               Down 55%\nNet income per diluted share    $                          1.74       $         3.85               Down 55%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2023 revenue was $26.97 billion, flat compared with a year ago.\n37\nTable of Contents\nData Center revenue was up 41% from a year ago led by strong growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects\npurchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud\nservice offerings and our research and development activities.\nGaming revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory\nlevels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting a lower sell-in to partners to help\nreduce channel inventory levels.\nAutomotive revenue was up 60% from a year ago reflecting growth in sales of self-driving solutions, computing\nsolutions for electric vehicle makers and strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions. The increase also included\ngrowth in automotive development arrangements.\nOEM and Other revenue was down 61% from a year ago driven by notebook OEM and CMP. CMP revenue was nominal in\nfiscal year 2023 and $550 million in fiscal year 2022.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2023 declined from a year ago, driven by $2.17 billion of inventory charges largely\nrelating to excess supply of NVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand\nexpectations for these products, particularly for the expected demand in China. The inventory charges were\ncomprised of $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of\nour demand expectations.\nOperating expenses, which included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction,\nwere up 50% from a year ago. The increase also reflected compensation, data center infrastructure, and engineering\ndevelopment costs.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.44 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash\ndividends. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase\nauthorization through December 2023.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $15.01 billion, up 41% from fiscal year 2022. The strong growth in\nData Center revenue was influenced by hyperscaler and cloud usage of our accelerated computing platforms and\nnetworking portfolio. In Data Center, we announced the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and began ramping the first\nproducts based on the architecture, including the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. The NVIDIA OVX server reference\ndesign launched for digital twins and other Omniverse applications. We completed two new large language models for\ncloud AI services — NVIDIA NeMo LLM and NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM. Additionally, we announced the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 end-\nto-end 400Gbps networking platform and began shipping Quantum-2 in December 2022.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $9.07 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Gaming results were\ninfluenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our channel partners. We\nintroduced pricing programs for our channel partners and started undershipping GPU supply to the partners so that\nwe could lower inventory in the channel. As we exited fiscal year 2023, we have made meaningful progress in\nestablishing lower inventory levels with our channel partners. In Gaming, we announced the new Ada Lovelace GPU\narchitecture, and introduced the first products based on Ada, including the GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX\n4070 Ti desktop GPUs and laptop GPUs featured in over 170 laptop designs. We introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3 for over 50\ngames and applications. We brought GeForce RTX 4080-class performance to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.54 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022.\nProfessional Visualization results were influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess\ninventory with our OEM partners. In Professional Visualization, we added new NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX GPUs\nfor workstations. We also announced Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and Omniverse Cloud and released a major update\nto NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2023 grew 60% compared to fiscal year 2022 to $903 million. In Automotive, we\nstarted production of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle SOC and introduced next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE\nThor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses\nand related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related\nto inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of\nthese critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit\nCommittee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and\nfuture product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which\nrequires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\nour products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product\nintroductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end\nuse cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the\nimpact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nCancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was\nan unfavorable impact of 7.5% in fiscal year 2023 and 0.9% in fiscal year 2022. As a fabless semiconductor company,\nwe must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must\naccount for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. In the past, our manufacturing lead times\nhave been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We place non-cancellable\ninventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide\ndeposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings\nand pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may\nimpact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling\n39\nTable of Contents\nprice basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each\nperformance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion and $907 million,\nrespectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management\ndetermined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income,\nincluding capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we\nwould recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n40\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on\nadvances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage,\nand network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five\nyears to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024.\nBased on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net\nin use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating\nincome by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal\nyear 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s\nwebsite at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,\n2023              2022\nRevenue                                    100.0  %          100.0  %\nCost of revenue                             43.1              35.1\nGross profit                                56.9              64.9\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development                    27.2              19.6\nSales, general and administrative            9.1               8.0\nAcquisition termination cost                 5.0                 —\nTotal operating expenses                    41.3              27.6\nIncome from operations                      15.6              37.3\nInterest income                              1.0               0.1\nInterest expense                            -1.0              -0.9\nOther, net                                  -0.1               0.4\nOther income (expense), net                 -0.1              -0.4\nIncome before income tax                    15.5              36.9\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                -0.7               0.7\nNet income                                  16.2  %           36.2  %\n41\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,            $         %\n2023              2022       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nCompute & Networking    $          15,068    $       11,046    $   4,022        36  %\nGraphics                           11,906            15,868       -3,962       -25  %\nTotal                   $          26,974    $       26,914    $      60         —  %\nCompute & Networking - The year-on-year increase was led by growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects\npurchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud\nservice offerings and our research and development activities. The increase was also related to the growth in\nAutomotive. CMP contributed an insignificant amount in fiscal year 2023 compared to $550 million in fiscal year\n2022.\nGraphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory\nlevels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal\nyears 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan\nrelated to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed\nlocation even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device\ncosts, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield\nfallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was\nprimarily due to $2.17 billion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04\nbillion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our\ncurrent demand projections.\nInventory provisions totaled $2.17 billion and $354 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of\ninventory that was previously written-off totaled $137 million and $111 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% and 0.9% in\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCompute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when\ncompared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory provisions.\nGraphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year\n2022, primarily due to inventory and related provisions and lower margins of GeForce GPUs.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,          January 30,               $         %\n2023                 2022          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           7,339       $        5,268       $   2,071        39  %\n% of revenue                                      27.2  %              19.6  %\nSales, general and administrative                2,440                2,166             274        13  %\nexpenses\n% of revenue                                       9.1  %               8.0  %\nAcquisition termination cost                     1,353                    —           1,353       100  %\n% of revenue                                       5.0  %                 —  %\nTotal operating expenses             $          11,132       $        7,434       $   3,698        50  %\n% of revenue                                      41.3  %              27.6  %\nThe increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased\ncompensation, employee growth, engineering development costs, and data center infrastructure.\nThe increase in sales, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased\ncompensation and employee growth.\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,            $         %\n2023              2022       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nInterest income                $             267    $           29    $     238       821  %\nInterest expense                            -262              -236          -26        11  %\nOther, net                                   -48               107         -155      -145  %\nOther income (expense), net    $             -43    $         -100    $      57       -57  %\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in\ninterest income was primarily due to higher yields earned on our investments.\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. The\nincrease in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion debt offering issued in June 2021.\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated\nentities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in other, net, compared to fiscal year 2022\nwas primarily driven by mark-to-market losses from publicly traded equity investments and changes in value from our\nnon-affiliated private investments. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\nIV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-\naffiliated entities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax benefit of $187 million for fiscal year 2023 and income tax expense of $189 million for\nfiscal year 2022. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023\nand an expense of 1.9% for fiscal year 2022.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, requires taxpayers to capitalize research\nand development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over\nfifteen years.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate includes the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and\ndevelopment expenses beginning in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in a greater FDII deduction and significantly\nincreased current taxes, with a corresponding deferred tax benefit at the relevant statutory tax rate.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nincreased tax benefits of the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit,\nrelative to lower profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of\nearnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time benefits of the domestication of a foreign\nsubsidiary in fiscal year 2022, or the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to\ntax benefits from the FDII deduction, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal\nresearch tax credit.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the FDII deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S.\nfederal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal\nresearch tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJanuary 29,       January 30,\n2023              2022\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         3,389    $        1,990\nMarketable securities                               9,907            19,218\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        13,296    $       21,208\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,\n2023              2022\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $         5,641    $        9,108\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $         7,375    $       -9,830\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing    $       -11,617    $        1,865\nactivities\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of\n$7.91 billion from the end of fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed\nincome securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our\nportfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to\na decrease in net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of $1.35\nbillion, and higher tax payments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were\nprimarily driven by lower accounts receivable due to strong collections partially offset by timing of supplier\npayments and inventory deliveries.\nCash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily driven\nby lower purchases and higher sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by higher capital expenditures.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, due to share\nrepurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in fiscal year 2023, offset by absence of debt repayment.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and cash generated\nby our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.25 billion of debt\nrepayment due in fiscal year 2024. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our\naccess to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued\nby highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nRefer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and\nthe cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.10 billion to $1.30\nbillion related to property and equipment.\nExcept for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of\nfiscal year 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and\nto amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. The adverse cash\nflow impact of mandatory capitalization will be reduced in future years as capitalized research and development\nexpenditures continue to amortize. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\nIV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.04 billion in share repurchases and $398 million in quarterly cash\ndividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our\nBoard of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder\nare in the best interests of our shareholders.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of\nour common stock up to $7.23 billion through December 2023.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n-In millions\nDue in one year                                 $         1,250\nDue in one to five years                                  2,250\nDue in five to ten years                                  4,000\nDue in greater than ten years                             3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs                -47\nNet carrying amount                                      10,953\nLess short-term portion                                  -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                         $         9,703\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

                "content": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to\nour analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values\nfor these investments of $17 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face\nvalue less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we\nhave no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of\n46\nTable of Contents\nthe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nadditional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United\nStates dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange\nrate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense. The\nimpact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have\ninternational operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses\nbenefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is\nIsraeli Shekel.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our\noperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge\nrelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are\nrecognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in\nother income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign\ncurrency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29,\n2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense),\nnet by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,\nassuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information."

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n29, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 29,\n2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system,\nwhich will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter\nof fiscal year 2023, we completed the consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included\nupdating our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are\nchanges that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected."

We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framewor k (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2023 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\n52\nTable of Contents\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and\nthe Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920\nmillion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s\napproach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii)\nthe consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose,

Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both\n52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to\nwrite off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement\ncosts, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates\nconsider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on\nadvances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage,\nand network equipment from threeto a range of fourto five years, and assembly and test equipment from fiveto seven\nyears. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the\ncarrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of\nthe end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $\n133million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nsold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and\nextended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession\nof the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.\nRevenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue\nrelated to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from oneto three yearsfor products in order to\nrepair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes\nthe estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for\nknown warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line\n60\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nattribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized\nusing an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock\npurchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and\nSeptember of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.\nAdditionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of\nforfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or\nsubstantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a\nloss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate\nthe loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual\nliability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could\nrequire us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets\nand liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and\nexpenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-\nmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been\nsignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.48billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state,\nand certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to\njurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains, tax attributes usage limitation by\ncertain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock\nownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would\nrecognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method,\nthe effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for\nperiods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as\navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized\ngains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity,\nnet of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses\non the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the\nother income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of\navailable-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any,\nis caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely\nthan not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nAllowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\nequity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative\ninstruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in\nearnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to\nthe risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative\ninstruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nidentified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure\nexcludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally threeto five years. Once an asset is\nidentified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and\nassets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a\nqualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from\npublicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding\nindustry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n63\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process\nresearch and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology\nlicenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods\nranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the\nintangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a\nstraight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an\nindefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible\nasset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nexceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be\ndisposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the\nfair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,\nbut our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions\nused in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are\ninherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the\nmeasurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nonly if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded\nthrough net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities\nby the investee.\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and\nrealized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate due to significant\n64\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nregulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of\n$ 1.35billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\nIn April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase\nconsideration of $ 7.13billion.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\nPurchase Price\nCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares    $  7,033\n(1)\nCash for Mellanox equity awards (2)                         16\nTotal cash consideration                                 7,049\nFair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by             85\nNVIDIA (3)\nTotal purchase consideration                          $  7,134\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents                             $    115\nMarketable securities                                      699\nAccounts receivable, net                                   216\nInventories                                                320\nPrepaid expenses and other assets                          179\nProperty and equipment, net                                144\nGoodwill                                                 3,431\nIntangible assets                                        2,970\nAccounts payable                                          -136\nAccrued and other current liabilities                     -236\nIncome tax liability                                      -191\nDeferred income tax liability                             -258\nOther long-term liabilities                               -119\n$  7,134\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately\n56million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249thousand Mellanox stock options held\nby employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices.\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non the estimated fair values.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.\nGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim\nindicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax\npurposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment.\nRefer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021\nsince the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal\nyear 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to\n65\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nintegration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28million were included in selling, general\nand administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as\nfollows:\nFair Value\n(In millions)    Useful Lives\nDeveloped technology (1)                    $          1,640    5 years\nCustomer relationships (2)                               440    3 years\nOrder backlog (3)                                        190    Based on actual shipments\nTrade names (4)                                           70    5 years\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible               2,340\nassets\nIPR&D (5)                                                630    N/A\nTotal identified intangible assets          $          2,970\n(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without\nMethod.\n(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-\nPeriod Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-\nRoyalty Method under the income approach.\n(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the\npattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset\nof $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not amortized.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and\nrestated, or the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other\nstock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options.\nAs of January 29, 2023, up to 47million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted\nunder the 2007 Plan, of which 2million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All\noptions are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant\nRSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 29, 2023, there were 160million\nshares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject to continued\nservice, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25%\nvesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-\ndetermined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C)\nover a four-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-\nyearperiod, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the\nanniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on\napproximately the three-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs\nand market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on\nachievement of pre-determined criteria.\n69\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently\namended and restated, or the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately\n24months, which is generally divided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased\nunder our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the\ncommencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within\nthe offering.

The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty activity consisted of\nthe following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,           January 31,\n2023              2022                  2021\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period                    $           46    $           22        $           15\nAdditions                                                    145                    40                    28\nUtilization                                                 -109               -16                   -21\nBalance at end of period                          $           82    $           46        $           22\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recorded $ 122million in product warranty liabilities primarily\nrelated to a defect identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. In the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2023, we recognized a warranty-related benefit of approximately $ 70million in cost of\nrevenue due to favorable product recovery.\nIn connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters\nsuch as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions\nin our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated\nbecause many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.\nLitigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on\nDecember 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses,\n79\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nincluding attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2,\n2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment\nin favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May\n10, 2022.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and\ninternal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain\nofficers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading,\nmisappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange\nAct based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n80\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income\ntaxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 29, 2023, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably\npossible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 29,\n2023, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong,\nIndia, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2022.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that\nprogram are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the\ndeclaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between\nadditional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $\n20million and retained earnings by $ 12.0billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares.\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 227million, $ 168million, and $ 120million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance.\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive AI\nCockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing\nplatforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and CMP.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and\nOmniverse Enterprise software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or\nGraphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-\nbased compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs,\nrestructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement costs, contributions, and other\nnon-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,\ntherefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment\nreporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our\nreportable segments and the “All Other” category.\n84\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nCompute & Networking\nYear Ended January 29, 2023:              (In millions)       Graphics       All Other       Consolidated\nRevenue                         $                15,068    $    11,906    $          —    $        26,974\nOperating income (loss)         $                 5,083    $     4,552    $     -5,411    $         4,224\nYear Ended January 30, 2022:\nRevenue                         $                11,046    $    15,868    $          —    $        26,914\nOperating income (loss)         $                 4,598    $     8,492    $     -3,049    $        10,041\nYear Ended January 31, 2021:\nRevenue                         $                 6,841    $     9,834    $          —    $        16,675\nOperating income (loss)         $                 2,548    $     4,612    $     -2,628    $         4,532\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,       January 31,\n2023              2022              2021\n-In millions\nReconciling items included in \"All\nOther\" category:\nStock-based compensation expense         $        -2,710    $       -2,004    $       -1,397\nAcquisition termination cost                      -1,353                 —                 —\nAcquisition-related and other costs                 -674              -636              -836\nUnallocated cost of revenue and                     -595              -399              -357\noperating expenses\nRestructuring costs and other                        -54                 —                 —\nIP-related and legal settlement costs                -23               -10               -38\nContributions                                         -2                 —                 —\nTotal                                    $        -5,411    $       -3,049    $       -2,628\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the billing location of the customer.\nEnd customer location may be different than our customer’s billing location.

Our compute solutions include\nall three major processing units in AI servers – GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will\ncontinue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. In\naddition, we offer DGX Cloud, an AI-training-as-a-service platform, and NeMo – a complete solution for building\nenterprise-ready Large Language Models, or LLMs, using open source and proprietary LLMs created by NVIDIA and third\nparties. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our\ncomputing platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI\nsupercomputers. There are over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help\ndeploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities\nand thousands of startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides\ninstruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our\naccelerated computing platform.\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics infused\nwith AI is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development\nresources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and\ncreate new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming,\ndesign, and creative industries forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an\noptimized experience on our GeForce and NVIDIA RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-\nend, from the developer tools and cloud services to the Tensor Cores included in all RTX-class GPUs. For example,\nNVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, is a suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life\nwith generative AI, running in the cloud or locally on the PC. GeForce Experience enhances each gamer’s experience\nby optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers\nenhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration\nand virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers, and creators to connect and collaborate in\nleading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo\nediting and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms\nsuch as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.\nAdvancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of autonomous vehicles, or AV, and\nelectric vehicles, or EV, is revolutionizing the transportation industry. The algorithms required for autonomous\ndriving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and\nwill use multiple neural networks instead. In addition, EV makers are looking for next-generation centralized car\ncomputers that integrate a wide range of intelligent functions into a single AI compute platform. Therefore, we\nprovide an AI-based hardware and software solution, designed and implemented from the ground up based on automotive\nsafety standards, for the AV and EV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our\npartnerships with automotive OEMs,\n7\nTable of Contents\ntier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural\nnetworks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air\nsoftware updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the\ntransportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our\ncustomers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities\ndirectly into their own products or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development\narrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\nSales and Marketing\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-\nperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our\nglobal markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our\npartner network incorporates global, regional and specialized CSPs, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, independent\nsoftware vendors, or ISVs, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, distributors, automotive manufacturers and tier-1\nautomotive suppliers, and other ecosystem participants.\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of\napplication engineers and solution architects to provide pre-sales assistance to our partner network in designing,\ntesting, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. For example, our solution architects work\nwith CSPs to provide pre-sales assistance to optimize their hardware and software infrastructure for generative AI\nand LLM training and deployment. They also work with foundation model and enterprise software developers to\noptimize the training and fine-tuning of their models and services, and with enterprise end-users, often in\ncollaboration with their global system integrator of choice, to fine-tune models and build AI applications. We\nbelieve that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market,\nmaintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and\npartner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and\nmaintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage\nwith key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product\nrequirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program supports the development of AI frameworks, SDKs,\nand APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning\nInstitute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to\nbuild AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization,\nand automotive. Our desktop gaming products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year.\nHistorical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for\nall phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the\nexpertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in\nsuch areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can\navoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While\nwe may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates,\nand a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance,\nmarketing, and customer support. In periods of growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain\nproduct components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future\nsupply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-\nterm manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-\nPacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from Micron\nTechnology, Inc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage\nwith independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron\nCorporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final products.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs,\nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies.

Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated\nor AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet\nInc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their\ninternal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\nsuppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles,\nautonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm\nIncorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products\nfor their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\nnetworking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including\noptical modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise\nCompany, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group as well as internal teams of system vendors\nand large cloud services companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\nissued patents have expiration dates from February 2024 to August 2043. We have numerous patents issued, allowed,\nand pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications\nprimarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on\ninternational treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in\nwhich our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the\npossibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek\nformal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements\nthat, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and\nH100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements\nalso apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with\nan ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us\nthe licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\nproducts.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in\nthe long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance\nof AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any\ntime and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements,\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our\ninventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,\nincluding the Middle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,\nresults of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and\nconsumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nSustainability and Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate\nsound environmental, social, and corporate governance principles and practices into every aspect of the Company.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and\ndiscussing with management our practices related to sustainability and corporate governance. We assess our programs\nannually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These\nissues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our\nstakeholders.\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and\npractices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information\ncontained on our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any\nother report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for\na discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to sustainability.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of environmental sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess\nrisks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn May 2023, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024\nmetrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2025. There has been no material impact to\nour capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental\nsustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025,\nour goal is to purchase\n10\nTable of Contents\nor generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we increased the percentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases\nto 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3\ncategory 1 GHG emissions with goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-\naccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it\nis optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products\nis evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered\n24 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will\nenable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate\nchange and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were\nengaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative\npositions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\nrelating to human capital management.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and\nhave been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong\nemployer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce\nis 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting,\nresulting in an increase in global female hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent,\nwith over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year 2024 coming from employee referrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted\ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand\nlearning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We create learning paths\nfocused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are\nexposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to\nsubsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide\none-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented specifically designed\nmentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure\nwidespread readiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that\nwe can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their\nthoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect\nthe identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive\nresponses.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come\nand stay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall turnover rate was 2.7%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour shareholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and\nfinancial health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside\nthe U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies to address mental health,\nstress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable\nsupport across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of\nour Community Resource Groups and continuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to\nbecome parents.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing\nteam of world-class talent and their families.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline\nthat includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and\nHispanic/Latino candidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\nPartnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\nEmbedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the\ninterview process and find internal opportunities;\nSupporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;\nProviding peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for\ndiversity;\nTrack equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of\nour workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nFlexible Working Environment\nWe support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under\ncertain conditions. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe\nmakes NVIDIA a great place to work.\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company wide 2-days\noff a quarter for employees to rest and recharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages, and positions as of\nFebruary 16, 2024:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       60    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

These areas could damage our reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or\nregulatory proceedings and liability.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates,\nchanges in tax laws, and other tax-related factors.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory proceedings.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nDelaware law, provisions in our governing documents and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive\nproducts, and industry standards.\nOur success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products\nand technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry\nstandards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products\ndeveloped by other companies;\n14\nTable of Contents\ndevelop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as\nsoftware-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance\nstandards;\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;\ndevelop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our\nbusiness, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations,\ncustomer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and\ncomplete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities.\nWe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not\nproduce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and\ntechnologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining\ndesign wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and\nfunctionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may\nprevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and\ntechnologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key\nsuccess criteria, our financial results may be harmed.\nWe have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners,\nwhich include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI\nFoundations for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services\nin their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support\nthese offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services\nhas changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer\nstandalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other\nsoftware solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any\nmeaningful standalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant\nrevenue from these offerings.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products,\nservices and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or\nprovide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-\nexpected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and\nhave longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections,\nmore design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors\nmay be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon\nopportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our\nability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment,\nwhich could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities\nsimilar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example,\nothers may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to\nestablish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable\nto successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and\nwe may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are\nnot provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-\nlinear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the\npast, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product\nshortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial\nresults.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past\nentered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure\nsufficient\n15\nTable of Contents\ncommitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These\nrisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new\nsuppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Additionally, our\nability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products\nare not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of\nshortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead\ntimes on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead\ntimes of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity,\nwhich have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale\ntheir capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require\nadditional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our\nrevenue declines.\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our\ncustomers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products\nand impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud\nservices;\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\nthe demand for our products; or\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on\ngaming usage.\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are\ngathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new\ndata center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with\nexisting suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These\nincreased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may\ncreate more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements.\nOur purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024\nwere impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving,\nand demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand\nindications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments\nexceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in\nthe past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior\narchitecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due\nto our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our\nData Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product\nlaunch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions\nmay magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times.\nQualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing\nchannel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in\nour revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation\narchitectures when customers anticipate\n16\nTable of Contents\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future\narchitecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our\nfinancial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\nmay result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions,\nwarranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional\nchallenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of\ncustomer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have\npreviously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs,\nODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple\nOEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market\nconditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to\nimpact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various\ndownstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-\ntime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a\ntimely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a\ntimely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient\nsupply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer\nrelationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\nAdditionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or\navailability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose\nto purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase\ncommitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel\npricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of\nfuture demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products\nin the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments\nand may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-\nreturnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to\nmake changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase\nas our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater\nportion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for\nnew use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels,\nand we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent\ntechnologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data\nCenter, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and\napplications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative\nAI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product\nofferings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to\nadequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and\nregional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China,\nwhich comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and\nassembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use\ncases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent\nspikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital\ncurrencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past\nor current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in\ncryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining\nand demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to\ncryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced\nand may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create\nincreased aftermarket sales of our\n17\nTable of Contents\nGPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our\nnew products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also\nmakes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products\nand distribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain\naccelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and\npublishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers,\nand other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by\nthird-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use\nby our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We\ndo not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These\nsubcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face several risks\nwhich have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply\nchain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business\noperations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and\ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or in a timely manner;\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nfailure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and\ntest providers and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products\nwithout our qualification;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply\nin advance;\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology; and\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes,\nfires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage\nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future\ncontain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number\nof issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may increase\nas our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are\nreleased. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used\nin our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products we or our\npartners offer rely on\n18\nTable of Contents\ntraining data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may\ncontain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component\nproviders may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the\ncustomer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services\nhave been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or\nexpose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could\nattack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to\nsubstantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive\nmanufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to\nincur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise,\nwrite-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from\nour product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely\nor satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after\ncommencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins,\ntemporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and\nprospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact\nour business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our\ncustomers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection\nwith indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data\nCenter products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and\nsupply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net\nwarranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have\naccurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our\nestimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought\nagainst us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our\nsupply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical\nand management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or\nfuture coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency\nfluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT\ninfrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global\nsupply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the\nfuture have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively\nimpacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which\nhave reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’\ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers,\nlicensing parties or other third parties we rely on;\nreduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for\nbankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances\namong other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial\ninstitutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or\nspeculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions,\nwhich could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to\nfulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are\nsubject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns\nor events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio\ncomprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit\nrating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an\nunrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our\nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the\nUnited States, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States. Our\nsales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal\nyear 2024. Although we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have\nstarted to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage\nof our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we\nexpect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The global nature of our business\nsubjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and\ninternational economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do\nbusiness, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards\nwith respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and\ncultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural\ndisasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations,\nreduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against\nthem or implement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported\nactors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally,\nsome actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical\nconflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable\nto a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products.\nWe may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other\nthird-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,\ncontractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our\nsecurity policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,\nsecurity incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security\npolicies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us.\nFurthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical\nbusiness systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication\ntechnology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business\ndisruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply\nchains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that\ncould result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and\nservices, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We may also incorporate\nthird-party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms. These datasets may be\nflawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents.\nWe may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our\nAI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may\nnot have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers\na security incident (which has happened in the\n20\nTable of Contents\npast and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct\naccess to their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. Additionally, we are\nincorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or\nservices are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could\nresult in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers\nhave appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our\ncustomers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and\nsecurity awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have\nidentified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security\ncontrols, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques\nchange frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience\ndelays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These\nvulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could\nresult in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and\ncustomers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved\ndissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose\nus and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation\nand subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm,\nincluding financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners\nin our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our\npartners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to\npotential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has\noccurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse\nconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight,\nrestrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds,\ndiversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and\noperations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar\nharms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions\ncould adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Applicable data privacy and security\nobligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators\nand investors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water\nshortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or\ncivil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and\nother natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our\ncurrent data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California,\nand other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia,\nmaking our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions\noccurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who\nprovide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in\nwhich we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical\ntensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the\nmanufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing\nregulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product\ndemand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support\noperations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations\ncould be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any\nreason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology\nsystem failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or\npolitical issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects\nus, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of\ndeclines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.\nAll of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year\n2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with\nthe conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may\ncontinue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience\nany significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact\nfuture product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third\nparties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of\nthese parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase\nour reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects,\ndisruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water\navailability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our\nproducts and services.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors.\nWater and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of\nour facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry\nconditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse\nimplications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability\nof our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure\nworldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and\nother risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our\npolicies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay\na claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits,\nsustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs,\nincluding costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in\nmanufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance\nand energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and\nrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter\nour operations and product design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we\nmay face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could\nharm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience\ncontractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result\nin increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could\nbe negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much\nmore energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and\ntechnologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments\ninvolve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or\nsell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular\ntransaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other\nstrategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in\nobtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain\ncritical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other\nchanges can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition,\nto the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been\n22\nTable of Contents\nharmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly\ntraded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\nIn addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives\nand to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining\ntheir strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time\nof our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in\nwhich we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our\ninvestment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry\nsectors could increase our impairment losses. We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic\ninvestments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; difficulty\nin realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic\ninvestment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or\nother consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\nand potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in\nwhich we are investing or are acquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating\nand retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products,\ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and\ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our\nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely\naffected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which\nwas attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling\nmultiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within\nour partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In\nthe future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their\necosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a\npurchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little\nnotice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets\nfor which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of\nour customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,\ndistributors and other channel partners. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through\nsystem integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately\n19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the\n23\nTable of Contents\nCompute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated\nnear a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase\ntheir credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a\nsignificant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’\ntrade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external\nfactors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and\nleaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in\ntheir administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nCompetition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times\nof stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value\nof our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our\nlongstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth\ntransitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term\nsuccess.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design\nand implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any\nERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an\nimpact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our\nfinancial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial\ndemands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material\nweakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the\ncapital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation\nby regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk\nfactors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future\nperformance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required\npayments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt\nwrite-offs;\nour vendors' payment requirements;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example,\nwe have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during\nmacroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may\ncontinue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the\ncash we have available for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses\nand investments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be\nsustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely\nto cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and\npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations;\ncybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our\ncompetitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our\nproducts. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance\nwith such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules\nand regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to\nmaterially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply\nour products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes\nor increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in\nour business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and\nChina. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and\ncompetition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition\nin those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United\nKingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our\ninvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to\nreceive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing\nrestrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI.\nIf implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt\ndeployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively\nimpacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and\nenforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import\nduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have\nan adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public\nperception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business\nand results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign\ngovernment bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and\nrestrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade\nbarriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity\nList or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill\nour contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have\nviolated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation\noccurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic\nsanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia,\nBelarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business\noperations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the\nfuture.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory\nrestrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result\nin additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns\nrelating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in\nunilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying\nLLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users\nworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively\nimpact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or\ntechnology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors\nassociated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control\nrestrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls\nrestricting GPUs and associated\n25\nTable of Contents\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have\nbeen and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all\ncustomers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our\nmanufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our\nability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial\nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are\nincreasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products,\nor services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage\nfor us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and\nsemiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to\nadditional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business\nand financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA\nAI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide\nservices to their end customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve\ndemand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export\ncontrols has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting\ncompetitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the\nexport control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and\nmaterially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our\nproducts or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export\ncontrols could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or\nmultilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the\nability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nAdditional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to\nprovide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our\nrevenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our\nfulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that\nwe have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to\nvarious penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and\nadverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing\nrequirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of\ncertain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture\ncertain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100\nintegrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and\nchip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for\ncertain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also\ninformed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to,\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements\nalso apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with\nan ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us\nthat the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\nproducts. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply\nand distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming,\nand adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue,\nduring any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new\nsolutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To\nthe extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the\ncustomer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\nlicense or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is\noffered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept.\nThe USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for\nreview. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports\nof products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming\nand resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on\nNVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\n26\nTable of Contents\ndisadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new\nrestrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position\nhas been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if\nthere are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or\nproduct scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own\ninternal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the\nUSG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur\nsignificant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or\nimpose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing\nrequirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale\ntechnical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives\nto our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions\nto limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by\nimposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip\ntracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are\ndetected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such\ncontrols to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and\ndistribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and\nEurope. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products,\nwhich are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter\nGPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may\nalso impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the\nability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a\nwider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against\ncertain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export\ncontrols have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to\n“design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to\nensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged\nand may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors\nrather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,\nexcessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China,\nbut also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls\nincrease the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready\nfor market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such\ncontrols may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S.\ncontrols.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to\ngames may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely\naffect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of\nour products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese\ngovernment announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron,\na supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact\nour business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners,\nespecially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components,\nparts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could\nresult in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers\nto do business with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and\ngovernment regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including\nthose associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate\nsustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there is an increasing number of state-\nlevel initiatives in the U.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’\nexpectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure\ncontrols may not meet evolving shareholder,\n27\nTable of Contents\nregulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or\nreporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and\ncomply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or\ndiscontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm\nour brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in\nreputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services\nmay result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues.\nWe are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also\noffer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and\nchallenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw\ncontroversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended\nconsequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human\nrights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective\ninternal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered\nthrough our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.\nComplying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain\nproducts and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with\nexisting and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as\nunder any U.S. regulation adopted in response to the Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also\nincrease the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency\nrequirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify\nthe USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could\ndisproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively\nimpact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the\nresponsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our\nproducts and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could\ninclude significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost\nprofits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless\nof their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they\nmay also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to\ninfringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP\nrights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could\nbe subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of\nour products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these\narrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result,\nthe value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We\nalso may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where\nto seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our\napplications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations.\nThese areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or\nresult in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws,\nregulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the\nprocessing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products\nand services with regard\n28\nTable of Contents\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters,\nincluding for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to\nour reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs\nrelated to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years,\nnumerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses,\nincluding providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning\ntheir personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain\npersonal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and\nautomated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products\nand services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including\nsensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory\nfines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access,\ndelete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how\nit is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and the law created a\nprivate right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as\nwell as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related\nto the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to\nadditional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning\ndata protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nclasses of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact\nand disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to\nthe United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border\npersonal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries\noutside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities\nto validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to\nprovide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data\nTransfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which\nallows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the\nFramework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States.\nHowever, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on\nthese measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are\nconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which\nwould increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example,\nChina’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as\nimportant under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior\nassessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements,\nincluding CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent\nus from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to\nimport personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit\nour ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security\nlaws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant\nexpense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for\nallegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply\nwith such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy\nlaws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their\nservice providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or\naltered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory\naction, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with\ncertain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies,\nmaterials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative\nof our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse\nconsequences.\n29\nTable of Contents\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our\nproduct design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any\nthird parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may\nfail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data\nprivacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government\nenforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal\ndata, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes\nin tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other\ntax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe\nour tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the\namount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net\nincome, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could\nincrease our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of\noperations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a\nsignificant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S.\ntax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net\nincome and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions\ncould arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and\nPillar Two Model Rules announced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and\nother changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect\nour provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives,\ncredits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to\nincome taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates\nof our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of\nexisting laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the\ndomestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting\nfor stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in\nthe period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-\nbased compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.\nFor example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we\nand certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently\nuncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from\nmanufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies,\nsuch as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse\nimpact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of\nsenior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to\nrefinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect\nour financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a\nsubstantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our\nflexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and\nrestrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially\nchange our business.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we\nbreach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness\nmay be declared\n30\nTable of Contents\nimmediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our\nsecurities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to\ncreate and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without\nprior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting\nrequirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with\nMicrosoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock,\nMicrosoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent\na change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire."

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and\nreactively address circumstances that arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These\ninclude processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our\ninformation security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001\ninternational standard for Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We\nconsult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk\nmanagement and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and\nprocesses, and we have in place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new\nrequirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and\nsignificant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires\ndesigned to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have\naccess to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors\nhave implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with\nthese vendors. We routinely assess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO\n28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.\nRefer to “Item 1A.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 16,\n2024, we had approximately 382 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0\nbillion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7\nbillion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional\nshares of our common stock up to $22.5 billion.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in\ncompliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and\nother factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the\nprogram may be suspended at any time at our discretion.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions,\nscientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are\ngathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new\ndata center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with\nexisting suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These\nincreased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may\ncreate more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing\ncapacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may\ncontinue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving,\nand demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand\nindications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments\nexceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into\nlong-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to\naddress our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten\nour product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our\nsupply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and\nour channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are\nalmost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization,\nand Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and\ndiverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated\nwith managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of\nnew product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and\ncomplexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory\nprovisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates\nadditional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact\nthe timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions\nand have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may\nimpair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases,\napplications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not\nbe able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such\nas generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term\ntrajectory is unknown.\n34\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain\nexceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated\ncircuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements\nalso apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with\nan ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us\nthe licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\nproducts. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to\n14% in fiscal year 2024.\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center\nproduct portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance\nnotice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China\nrepresented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due\nto USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year\n2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license\nfor the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the\nlicense application in a timely manner or at all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in\nthe long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance\nof AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any\ntime and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements,\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our\ninventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,\nincluding the Middle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply\nchain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our\nresults of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these\nmacroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital\nequipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-\nterm changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our\nvendors.\nIsrael and Hamas Conflict\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year\n2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with\nthe conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may\ncontinue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience\nany significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact\nfuture product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year 2024 Summary\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024          Jan 29, 2023       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                        60,922       $        26,974               Up 126%\nGross margin                                               72.7  %               56.9  %            Up 15.8 pts\nOperating expenses              $                        11,329       $        11,132               Up 2%\nOperating income                $                        32,972       $         4,224               Up 681%\nNet income                      $                        29,760       $         4,368               Up 581%\nNet income per diluted share    $                         11.93       $          1.74               Up 586%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago.\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 217%. Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer\ninternet applications, and multiple industry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare.\nCustomers across industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. Data\nCenter compute revenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the\nnormalization of channel inventory levels and growing demand.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%.\nAutomotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving\nplatforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory\nprovisions as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating expenses increased for fiscal year 2024, driven by growth in employees and compensation increases. Fiscal\nyear 2023 also included a $1.4 billion acquisition termination charge related to the proposed Arm transaction.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $47.5 billion, up 217% from fiscal year 2023. In Data Center, we\nlaunched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and\nNVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX\nCloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI\nmodels. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA’s\nautomotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately\n40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers\nrepresented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers.\nWe announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023. In Gaming, we launched the\nGeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. We announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud\nEngine for Games, a custom AI model foundry service using AI-powered natural language interactions to transform\ngames and launched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. Additionally, we released TensorRT-LLM for Windows and launched\nGeForce RTX 40-Series SUPER GPUs. Gaming reached a milestone of 500 AI-powered RTX games and applications utilizing\nNVIDIA DLSS, ray tracing and other NVIDIA RTX technologies.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.6 billion, up 1% from fiscal year 2023. In\nProfessional Visualization, we announced new GPUs based on the NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace architecture, and announced\nNVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure, for the development and deployment of\nindustrial metaverse applications.\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 21% from fiscal year 2023. In Automotive, we announced\na partnership with MediaTek, which will develop mainstream automotive systems on chips for global OEMs integrating\na new NVIDIA GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics. We furthered our collaboration with Foxconn to develop next-\ngeneration\n36\nTable of Contents\nelectric vehicles, and announced further adoption of NVIDIA DRIVE platform with BYD, XPENG, GWM, Li Auto, ZEEKR and\nXiaomi.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related\ndisclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nestimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We\nhave critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory\nprovisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management\njudgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\nour products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product\nintroductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate\ncustomer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of\nchanges in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nCancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an\nunfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase\ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-party manufacturers' lead\ntimes and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond\ntwelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in\nadvance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We\nalso adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product\ntransitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application\nof complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added\ncertainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign\njurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities\nfor potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,\nadditional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional\nincome tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion,\nrespectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not,\nwe would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return\nrights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of\nprior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns\nfor credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue\nand accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs\ninclude distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which\nrequire judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals\ninclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and\nexternal factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services\nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to\ndate as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each\nproject includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs\nas applicable.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each\nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements,\nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration\nor interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered\ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance\nobligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone\nselling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not\nsell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other\nobservable inputs.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in\ntechnology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network\nequipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to\nseven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million\nfor cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\nmillion and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal\nyear 2023 is presented below.

Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of\nInfiniBand.\nGraphics revenue – The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to\npartners following the normalization of channel inventory levels.\nReportable segment operating income – The year-on-year increase in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating\nincome was driven by higher revenue.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAll Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost\nin fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year\n2024.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to\nend customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of\nthe United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public\nsector entities, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, AIB, and distributors.\nSales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to\nthe Compute & Networking segment.\nOne indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including\nthrough Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024,\nattributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nOur estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.\nThere were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device\ncosts, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield\nfallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nOur overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year\nincrease was primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a\npercentage of revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024\nand 2023. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted\nin a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net\neffect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended                                     $         %\nJan 28, 2024          Jan 29, 2023          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           8,675       $         7,339       $   1,336        18  %\n% of net revenue                                  14.2  %               27.2  %\nSales, general and administrative                2,654                 2,440             214         9  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                   4.4  %                9.1  %\nAcquisition termination cost                         —                 1,353          -1,353      -100  %\n% of net revenue                                     —  %                5.0  %\nTotal operating expenses             $          11,329       $        11,132       $     197         2  %\n% of net revenue                                  18.6  %               41.3  %\nThe increase in research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year\n2024 was primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee\ngrowth and compensation increases.\nAcquisition Termination Cost\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended                               $\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Change\n-$ in millions\nInterest income                $             866    $           267    $     599\nInterest expense                            -257               -262            5\nOther, net                                   237                -48          285\nOther income (expense), net    $             846    $           -43    $     889\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in\ninterest income was due to higher yields on higher cash balances.\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nOther, net, consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the\nimpact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in Other, net, compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by\nchanges in value from our non-affiliated investments. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our\ninvestments in non-affiliated entities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax expense of $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024 and income tax benefit of $187 million for\nfiscal year 2023. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year\n2024 and a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax\nreturns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related\nto this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of a reduction in\nunrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit,\npartially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based\ncompensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The\nincrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax\ncredit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules\nfor a new 15% global minimum tax applicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including\nEuropean Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two legislation that will start to become\neffective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and\nlegislation on Pillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global\nimplementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact our effective\ntax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         7,280    $         3,389\nMarketable securities                              18,704              9,907\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        25,984    $        13,296\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $        28,090    $         5,641\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $       -10,566    $         7,375\nactivities\nNet cash used in financing activities       $       -13,633    $       -11,617\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of\ninvestment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to growth in\nrevenue. Accounts receivable balance in fiscal year 2024 reflected $557 million from customer payments received\nahead of the invoice due date.\nCash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily driven\nby lower marketable securities maturities and higher purchases of marketable securities.\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to a debt\nrepayment and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share repurchases.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated\nby our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $26.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.3 billion of debt\nrepayment due in fiscal year 2025 and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital\nresources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued\nby highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nRefer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we expect to use our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the\ncash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion\nrelated to property and equipment.\nExcept for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of\nfiscal year 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends.\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of\nDirectors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in\nthe best interests of our shareholders.\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0\nbillion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7\nbillion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional\nshares of our\n42\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock up to $22.5 billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased 2.8 million\nshares for $1.9 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset\ndilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and\nother investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares\nissued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022 which was not material for fiscal year 2024.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 28, 2024, by year payable, are as follows:\nJan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nDue in one year                                 $         1,250\nDue in one to five years                                  2,250\nDue in five to ten years                                  2,750\nDue in greater than ten years                             3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs                -41\nNet carrying amount                                       9,709\nLess short-term portion                                  -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                         $         8,459\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to\nour analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for\nthese investments of $93 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $9.7 billion of senior Notes net outstanding. We carry the Notes at face\nvalue less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we\nhave no\n43\nTable of Contents\nfinancial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United\nStates dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange\nrate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The\nimpact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their manufacturing costs.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been $116 million and $112 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign\ncurrency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January 28, 2024 and\nJanuary 29, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by\ncorresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming\nthe hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information."

We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there\nare changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected."

We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the\nCompany’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was\n$16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s\napproach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii)\nthe consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose,

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were\nall 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation,\nlitigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment,\nand other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in\ntechnology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network\nequipment from threeto fouror five years, and our assembly and test equipment from fiveto seven years. The effect\nof this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $ 33million and $ 102million for cost of\nrevenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $ 135million and\nnet income of $ 114million after tax, or $ 0.05per both basic and diluted share.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs\nfor potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession\nof the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.\nRevenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue\nrelated to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a\nstandalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a\nsingle contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely\nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance\nobligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the\nprice we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from oneto three yearsfor products to repair or replace products\nfor manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product\nwarranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an\nextended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification\nissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or\nESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.\nStock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in\nsubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical\nexperience.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement\npayments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our\npending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated\nwith such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such\nlitigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record\nadditional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and\nliabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and\nexpenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-\nmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been\nsignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts\nor circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies\nbased on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that\npayment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we\nmay be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\naccordingly.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and\ncertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part,\nto jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax\nbenefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity\nawards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as\navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized\ngains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity,\nnet of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses\non the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the\nother income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of\navailable-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any,\nis caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely\nthan not we will be required or\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nwe intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and\nwrite-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\nequity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative\ninstruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in\nearnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to\nthe risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative\ninstruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is\ncomputed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of threeto seven years.\nOnce an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or\namortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to\nthirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold\nimprovements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or\nthe estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a\nquantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from\npublicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding\nindustry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer\nrelationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently\namortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that\nreflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or,\nif that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected\nto be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its\nestimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and\nliabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would\nbe reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be\ndepreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the\npurchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and\nassumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount\nrate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently\nuncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement\nperiod of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-\nmarketable equity securities, which are investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have\nreadily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable\nequity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do\nnot have readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in\nthe same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market\nand the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All\ngains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on\nour Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted\nfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is\nidentified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide\nfor additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our\nannual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026\nretrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and changes to income tax\ndisclosures including disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The amendments\nin the standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and\nshould be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our\nannual period beginning fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to\nsignificant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition\ntermination cost of $ 1.4billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at\nsigning.\nNote 3 - Leases\nOur lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and\ninternational office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2025 and\n2035.\nFuture minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 28, 2024, are as follows:\nOperating Lease Obligations\nFiscal Year:                                                    (In millions)\n2025                                           $                          290\n2026                                                                      270\n2027                                                                      253\n2028                                                                      236\n2029                                                                      202\n2030 and thereafter                                                       288\nTotal                                                                   1,539\nLess imputed interest                                                     192\nPresent value of net future minimum lease                               1,347\npayments\nLess short-term operating lease liabilities                               228\nLong-term operating lease liabilities          $                        1,119\nIn addition, we have operating leases, primarily for our data centers, that are expected to commence within fiscal\nyear 2025 with lease terms of 1to 10years for $ 1.1billion.\nOperating lease expenses for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $ 269million, $ 193million, $ 168million,\nrespectively.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended\nand restated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to\nemployees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 28,\n2024, up to 37million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007\nPlan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 28,\n2024, there were 147million shares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject to continued\nservice, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25%\nvesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-\ndetermined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C)\nover a four-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-\nyearperiod, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the\nanniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on about the\nthree-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based\nPSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined\ncriteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently\namended and restated, the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is about 24months,\ndivided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be\nequal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering\nperiod or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 28,\n2024, we had 227million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs\nOutstanding\nNumber of Shares            Weighted Average\n(In millions, except per share data)       Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalances, Jan 29, 2023                                                           45    $                 158.45\nGranted                                                                          14    $                 374.08\nVested restricted stock                                                         -21    $                 148.56\nCanceled and forfeited                                                           -1    $                 206.35\nBalances, Jan 28, 2024                                                           37    $                 245.94\nVested and expected to vest after Jan                                            37    $                 245.49\n28, 2024\nAs of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, there were 147million and 160million shares, respectively, of common\nstock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\nThe total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 28,\n2024, January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022, was $ 8.2billion, $ 4.3billion, and $ 5.6billion, respectively.\nNote 5 - Net Income Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for\nthe periods presented:\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Jan 30, 2022\n-In millions, except per share\ndata\nNumerator:\nNet income                          $                              29,760    $         4,368    $         9,752\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares                                       2,469              2,487              2,496\nDilutive impact of outstanding\nequity                                                                 25                 20                 39\nawards\nDiluted weighted average shares                                     2,494              2,507              2,535\nNet income per share:\nBasic (1)                           $                               12.05    $          1.76    $          3.91\nDiluted (2)                         $                               11.93    $          1.74    $          3.85\nEquity awards excluded from\ndiluted net\nincome per share because their                                         15                 40                 21\neffect\nwould have been anti-dilutive\n(1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.\n(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.\nNote 6 - Goodwill\nAs of January 28, 2024, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.4billion, consisting of goodwill balances\nallocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $ 4.1billion and $ 370million, respectively.\nAs of January 29, 2023, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.4billion, consisting of goodwill balances\nallocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $ 4.0billion and $ 370million, respectively.\nGoodwill increased by $ 59million in fiscal year 2024 from an immaterial acquisition and was allocated to our\nCompute & Networking reporting unit.

Therefore, the change in fair value of these\ncontracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign\ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nDesignated as cash flow hedges    $         1,168    $         1,128\nNon-designated hedges             $           597    $           366\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of\nJanuary 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023.\nAs of January 28, 2024, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18months. The expected\nrealized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency\nforward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.\nDuring fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting\ntreatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be\nhighly effective.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 12 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nThe carrying value of our outstanding notes, the calendar year of maturity, and the associated interest rates were\nas follows:\nExpected    Effective\nRemaining Term (years)    Interest Rate       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\n0.309% Notes Due 2023 (1)                              —    0.41%            $             —    $         1,250\n0.584% Notes Due 2024                                0.4    0.66%                      1,250              1,250\n3.20% Notes Due 2026                                 2.6    3.31%                      1,000              1,000\n1.55% Notes Due 2028                                 4.4    1.64%                      1,250              1,250\n2.85% Notes Due 2030                                 6.2    2.93%                      1,500              1,500\n2.00% Notes Due 2031                                 7.4    2.09%                      1,250              1,250\n3.50% Notes Due 2040                                16.2    3.54%                      1,000              1,000\n3.50% Notes Due 2050                                26.2    3.54%                      2,000              2,000\n3.70% Notes Due 2060                                36.2    3.73%                        500                500\nUnamortized debt discount and\nissuance                                                                                 -41                -47\ncosts\nNet carrying amount                                                                    9,709             10,953\nLess short-term portion                                                               -1,250             -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                                                      $         8,459    $         9,703\n(1) In fiscal year 2024, we repaid the 0.309% Notes Due 2023.\nAll our notes are unsecured senior obligations.

Maximum\npotential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated\nliability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.\nLitigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on\nDecember 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without\nleave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an\nappeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August\n25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district\ncourt’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the\nNinth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on\nOctober 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the mandate\npending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme\nCourt’s\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nresolution of the matter. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate.\nNVIDIA’s deadline to file a petition for a writ of certiorari is March 4, 2024.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. Following the Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the\nparties are conferring regarding the next steps in this derivative matter. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly\non behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust\nenrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based\non the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including\nreforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. Following the Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing\non November 15, 2023, the parties are conferring regarding the next steps in these derivative matters. The lawsuits\nassert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of\nfiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations\nof Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and\nmisleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The\nplaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA\nstock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,\ncaptioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of\nus, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on\nthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This\nderivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 28, 2024, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated

Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.1billion and $ 250million of\ncumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We\nhave not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these\ninvestments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion and $ 1.5billion,\nrespectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not,\nwe would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 315million, $\n342million and $ 361million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years\n2026 and 2025, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 361million may be carried forward\nindefinitely. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 31million, before the\nimpact of uncertain tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. We have state research tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 1.6billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $ 1.5billion is attributable to the\nState of California and may be carried over indefinitely and $ 75million is attributable to various other states\nand will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of\n$ 1.4billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025.\nOur tax attributes remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other\nauthoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of tax attributes may also be\nsubject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and\nsimilar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the tax attributes may expire or be denied\nbefore utilization.\n76\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Jan 30, 2022\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period            $         1,238    $         1,013    $           776\nIncreases in tax positions for current                616                268                246\nyear\nIncreases in tax positions for prior                   87                  1                 14\nyears\nDecreases in tax positions for prior                 -148                -15                 -4\nyears\nSettlements                                          -104                 -9                 -8\nLapse in statute of limitations                       -19                -20                -11\nBalance at end of period                  $         1,670    $         1,238    $         1,013\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28, 2024 are $ 1.0billion of tax benefits that\nwould affect our effective tax rate if recognized.\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we\nanticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income\ntaxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We\nrecognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our\nconsolidated statements of income of $ 42million, $ 33million, and $ 14million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we have accrued $ 140million and $ 95million,\nrespectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included\nas a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 28, 2024, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably\npossible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 28,\n2024, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States for fiscal\nyears after 2020, as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal\nyears 2005 through 2023. As of January 28, 2024, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under\nexamination include Germany, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2005 through 2023.\nNote 15 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $\n25.0billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21million shares of our common stock for $\n9.7billion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional\nshares of our common stock up to $ 22.5billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased\n2.8million shares for $ 1.9billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to\noffset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market\nfactors and other investment opportunities.\nDuring fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, we paid $ 395million, $ 398million, and $ 399million in cash dividends to\nour shareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that\nprogram are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the\ndeclaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between\nadditional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $\n20million and retained earnings by $ 12.0billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $ 255million, $ 227million, and $ 168million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance.\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive\nartificial intelligence, or AI, Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle\nsolutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI\nEnterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvirtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems;\nand Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet applications.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or\nGraphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-\nbased compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs,\nintellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost, and other non-recurring charges\nand benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment. However, our CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,\ntherefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment\nreporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements.

We use the\nexpertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in\nsuch areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can\navoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While\nwe may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates,\nand a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance,\nmarketing, and customer support. In periods\n8\nTable of Contents\nof growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our\nhistorical lead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to\ncontinue to do so.\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-\nterm manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is mainly concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix\nInc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with\nindependent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron\nCorporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final products.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs,\nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some\nof our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and\nmay be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment\nin the future.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other\naccelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD,\nHuawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated\nor AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet\nInc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their\ninternal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\nsuppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles,\nautonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm\nIncorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products\nfor their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\nnetworking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including\noptical modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise\nCompany, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and Marvell Technology, Inc. as well as internal teams of system\nvendors and large cloud services companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\nissued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and\npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\n9\nTable of Contents\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments.\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions,\nimpacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or\nany other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23,\n2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100,\nA800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems,\nsuch as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a\nlicense for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that\npartners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\nperformance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given\nthe increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\nIFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that\nincorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive\ncustomers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,\nresults of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and\nconsumer laws, could further increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item\n1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nSustainability and Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate\nsound environmental, social, and corporate governance principles and practices into every aspect of the Company.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and\ndiscussing with management our practices related to sustainability and corporate governance. We assess our programs\nannually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These\nissues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our\nstakeholders.\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and\npractices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report.

Risk Factors” for\na discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to sustainability.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of environmental sustainability, we work to address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle\nand assess related risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn May 2024, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2024. Fiscal year 2025\nmetrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2026. There has been no material impact to\nour capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental\nsustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. We committed to purchase or\ngenerate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under\nour operational control starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, we made progress towards this goal\nand increased the percentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year\n2026, we also aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG\nemissions with the goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-\naccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it\nis optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. We continue to have a strong presence\non the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems—we powered 8 of the top 10 most energy efficient systems,\nincluding the top supercomputer, on the November 2024 Green500 list.\nWe launched our Earth-2 initiative to create a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse\nplatforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of\nthe impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had approximately 36,000 employees in 38 countries; 27,100 were\nengaged in research and development and 8,900 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative\npositions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\nrelating to human capital management.\nTo execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally,\nincluding exceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be high, we have grown our technical workforce and have been\nsuccessful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA.

                "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which\ncould cause our stock\n13\nTable of Contents\nprice to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe\nare immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to\nestimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and could\ndamage our business.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nProduct, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect\nour financial condition, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations and financial results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets.\nA significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from\nselling to any of these end customers.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain, and motivate our executives and key employees.\nModification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business and\ninternal controls.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results\nare below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock, and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on\nthe export of our products, which may adversely impact our business.\nIncreased scrutiny regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in financial, reputational, or\noperational harm and liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial\nharm and liability.\nAdequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are\nunsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other\nobligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or\nregulatory proceedings and liability.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates,\nchanges in tax laws, and other tax-related factors.\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory\nproceedings.\nDelaware law, provisions in our governing documents and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive\nproducts, and industry standards.\nOur success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products\nand technologies that meet the evolving needs of our markets, including addressing unexpected shifts in industry\nstandards or disruptive technological innovations that could render our products incompatible with those developed\nby other companies;\ndevelop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as\nsoftware-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance\nstandards;\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;\ndevelop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our\nbusiness, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations,\ncustomer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities, and cloud service capacity; and\ncomplete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities.\nWe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not\nproduce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and\ntechnologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining\ndesign wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and\nfunctionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may\nprevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that our products and\ntechnologies will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our\nfinancial results may be harmed.\nWe offer enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and\nservices for training and deploying AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in\ntheir data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support\nthese offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services\nhave changed and may continue to shift, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer\nstandalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and other software\nproducts. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful\nstandalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from\nthese offerings.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer and market needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’\nproducts, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be\ncheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in\nlower-than-expected selling prices or demand for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own\nfabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP\nportfolios and patent protections, more design\n15\nTable of Contents\nwins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able\nto acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon\nopportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our\nability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment,\nwhich could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities\nsimilar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example,\nothers may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to\nestablish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable\nto successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and\nwe may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate\ncustomer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated\ndemand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our\nsupply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to\nexperience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,\nprovided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our\nproduct costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to\naddress our business needs.\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not\nbe able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between\nsupply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory,\nsignificantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners\nand contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to\nmeet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be\ndamaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex\ndata center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may\nhave a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if\ncomponents necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we\nmay not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce\naverage selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products\nas a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and\nrecord impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable\nand non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we\nneed to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to\nincrease as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a\ngreater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial\nresults.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact\nthe timing and volume of our revenue, include:\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\nchanges in business and economic conditions;\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products;\nchanges in end-user demand;\n16\nTable of Contents\npurchasing decisions made, and inventory levels held by, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, system integrators, other\nchannel partners and other third parties;\nthe ability of developers, end customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated\ncomputing applications that leverage our platforms;\nthe availability of third-party content on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW;\nthe demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models;\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls, increased restrictions on gaming\nusage, or tariffs; and\nour customers' ability to invest in AI infrastructure.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and\nregional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China,\nwhich comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and\nassembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and\nmay continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future\nproducts. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our\nsupply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning,\nexecution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead\nto increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing\nindustry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing\nand diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center\nsolutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center\nofferings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create\nvolatility in our revenue. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and\nchannel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce,\nor create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for\ncurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple\nproduct architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have\nbeen and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as\nplanned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in\nunanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or\nother costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025\nwere negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may\nimpact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay\npurchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new\nproducts as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have\nmanaged prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions\nare difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur\nadditional costs.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our\nrevenue or supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be\nused in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision\nthe impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand\nfor our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago,\nour Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to\nestimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast\nthe future impact of\n17\nTable of Contents\ncryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute\ntechnologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new\ncryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in\nthe future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nEthereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This\nhas created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact\nretail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold\nproducts may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult.\nGray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Our\ninability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our revenue.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We\ndo not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These\nsubcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face risks which have\nadversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain,\nnegatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity;\ndecommitment by our suppliers;\npotential higher wafer and component prices resulting from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place\norders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or timely;\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain, or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nfailure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and\ntest providers and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules;\nintegration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers creating more complexity in managing multiple suppliers\nwith variations in production planning, execution, and logistics;\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to provide high quality products and/or making changes to their products\nwithout our qualification;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply\nin advance;\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from issues in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology;\nsuppliers extending lead times and/or increasing costs during shortages; and\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes,\nfires, or other natural disasters, electricity conservation efforts, pandemics, and cybersecurity incidents.\n18\nTable of Contents\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage\nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future\ncontain defects, security vulnerabilities, experience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in\ndesign, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may also increase when our\nproducts are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and\nwhen we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements\nreduce our direct control over production. AI software products that we or our partners offer rely on training data\nthat may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or\nundetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may\ncontain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for\nwarranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in\nthe past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or\nexpose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could\nattack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to\nsubstantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIB manufacturers,\nautomotive manufacturers, and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may\ncause us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or\notherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues\nmay not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related\nsoftware drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance,\nloss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with\nexisting and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn\nnegatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to\nreimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or\nin connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data\nCenter products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and\nsupply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net\nwarranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have\naccurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our\nestimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought\nagainst us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our\nsupply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical\nand management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or\nfuture coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency\nfluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT\ninfrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global\nsupply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, including the implementation of\ntariffs by the USG or other governments, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging\neffects on our business and financial results, including:\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively\nimpacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which\nhave reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’\ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, CSPs, data center providers, licensing parties or other\nthird parties we rely on;\nreduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for\nbankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances\namong other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial\ninstitutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or\nspeculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions,\nwhich could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to\nfulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are\nsubject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns\nor events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio\ncomprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit\nrating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an\nunrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our\nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the\nUnited States, and we generated 53% of our revenue in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. The\nmarket in China, where our offerings are limited by export controls, is highly competitive and we expect it to\nremain competitive going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and\nuncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political\nconditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to\ncontrol case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP\nand employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to\ncapital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other\nmilitary actions, terrorism, public health issues, restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs, sanctions,\nand other controls on imports or exports, and catastrophic events.\nProduct, system security, and data protection incidents or breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our\noperations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against\nthem or implement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restore from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported\nactors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally,\nsome actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical\nconflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be subject to\na heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We\nmay also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other\nthird-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,\ncontractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our\nsecurity policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,\nsecurity incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security\npolicies and access control mechanisms, including, for example, employees posting company data on third-party\nwebsites without permission, and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there\ncan be no assurance that an insider threat or error will not result in an incident that is material to us or lead\nto negative publicity. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate\ncertain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and\nauthentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to\n20\nTable of Contents\nsupply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in\nour supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable\nvulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology\nsystems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our\nservices. We have incorporated third-party data into some of our AI models and used open-source datasets to train\nour models and may continue to do so. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased\ninformation, and may otherwise decrease resilience to security incidents that may compromise the integrity of our\nAI outputs, leading to potential reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, or adverse impacts on the performance\nand reliability of our products, which could, in turn, affect our partners' operations, customer trust, and our\nrevenue. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers,\nincluding for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is\nlimited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-\nparty suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past and may happen in the future), our\nresponse may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other\ninformation related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large\nnumber of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of\nour customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers\nhave appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our\ncustomers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and\nsecurity awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have\nidentified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security\ncontrols, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques\nchange frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience\ndelays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These\nvulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could\nresult in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and\ncustomers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved\ndissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose\nus and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation\nand subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm,\nincluding financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners\nin our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our\npartners to the risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to\npotential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has\noccurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse\nconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight,\nrestrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds,\ndiversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and\noperations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar\nharms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions\ncould adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. We are required by certain data privacy\nand security obligations to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and\ninvestors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In\naddition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause disruptions to our worldwide operations include: natural\ndisasters, extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, critical infrastructure failures,\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil\nunrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory changes, and other natural\nor man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data\ncenter capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other\ncritical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring\nin these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us\ncritical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and\ndomestic political developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally.\nPolitical instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major\ncountries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide\ngeopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where\nthe manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in\nchanging regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies,\nproduct\n21\nTable of Contents\ndemand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support\noperations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations\ncould be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any\nreason, including natural disasters, high heat events, water shortages, power shortages, information technology\nsystem failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, and business, labor, environmental, public health,\nor political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects\nus, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of\ndeclines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.\nOur business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. All of these\nrisks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our employees in the region\nhave been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption\nto our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business;\nhowever, if the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations,\nand revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third\nparties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of\nthese parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase\nour reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects,\ndisruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, land or permitting constraints, or\nregulations that limit energy, water, or land availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand\ntheir data center capacity and consume our products and services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors.\nWater and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of\nour facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry\nconditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse\nimplications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability\nof our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure\nworldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and\nother risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our\npolicies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay\na claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits,\nsustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs,\nincluding costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in\nmanufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and\nenergy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, and greater indirect costs resulting from our customers\nand/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could\nharm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and\nproduct design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we\nmay face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could\nharm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience\ncontractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result\nin increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could\nbe negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much\nmore energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand\nor enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could\nimpair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a\nnegative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter\ninto other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely\ncomplete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable\nto pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions\nthat reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to\nconsummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further,\nour investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to\nthe value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to\nfurther our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include\nearly-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-\nmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To\nthe extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose\nall or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline\nin any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and\nother resources, including management’s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties\nto realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining\ngovernmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to\nidentify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating\nand retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products,\ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and\ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our\nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely\naffected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of\ncustomers, and this trend may continue. Sales to direct Customers A, B and C represented 12%, 11% and 11% of total\nrevenue, respectively, for fiscal year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking\nsegment. With\n23\nTable of Contents\nseveral of these partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels.\nOur operating results depend on sales to our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell\nproducts that incorporate our technologies. We have a small number of partners that are involved in system\nintegration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be\nunable to meet specifications of our key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their\nownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center\nsystems to customers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales\nare made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own\nsolutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose\nmarket share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’\npurchasing patterns. Many of our indirect customers often do not purchase directly from us but through multiple\nOEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect\ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through\nCustomer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking\nsegment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the\nsystem integrators, distributors, and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which\ncould impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction\nin purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or\nany difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive and successfully execute our business strategy, we must attract, retain, and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees, as well as recruit and develop exceptional and diverse talent. However, labor is\nsubject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for\nskilled workers and leaders, and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations,\nor in their administration or interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nCompetition for talent drives up costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. In times of stock price\nvolatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-\nbased compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding\nexecutive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge, and smooth transitions\ninvolving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning, execution, and long-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design\nand implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any\nERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an\nimpact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our\nfinancial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial\ndemands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material\nweakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the\ncapital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation\nby regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors.\nTherefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance.\nFactors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n24\nTable of Contents\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required\npayments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt\nwrite-offs;\nour vendors' payment requirements;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny of these factors could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have\ngranted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic\ndownturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask\nfor shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have\navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and\ninvestments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be\nsustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely\nto cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the\nexport of our products, which may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\nemployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use\nof AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and\nexpensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to\nmanufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers\nor agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help\nensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our\nofficers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to\nthe laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could\nlead to materially greater compliance and other costs, and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture\nand supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result\nof changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from\nregulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased\ninterest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United\nKingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us\nregarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing\ninquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, broad requests for\ninformation from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and\nSouth Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation\nmodels and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the\nmarkets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell\nhardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We expect to\nreceive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and could\nnegatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware,\nsoftware, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act\nbecame effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period. The EU AI Act\nmay impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or\nhave already enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or\nrelease AI models, and increase our compliance costs. Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if\nimplemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems\nusing our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and\nfinancial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in\nincreased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and\ncontrols on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the\nregions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign\ngovernment bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and\nrestrictions on\n25\nTable of Contents\nthe activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and\nrestrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do\nbusiness without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual\nobligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export\ncontrol laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without\nour knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material\nand adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic\nsanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia,\nBelarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business\noperations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the\nfuture.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory\nrestrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result\nin additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns\nrelating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in\nunilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying\nLLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of\ndownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software,\nand services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or\ntechnology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors\nassociated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions\nproposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls\nrestricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will\nbe adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from\nexporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China and over\n150 countries designated “Tier 2” by the January 2025 AI Diffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our\nmanufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our\nability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial\nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are\nincreasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products,\nor services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage\nfor us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and\nsemiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to\nadditional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business\nand financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA\nAI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their\nend customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve\ndemand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export\ncontrols has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting\ncompetitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the\nexport control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and\nmaterially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our\nproducts or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export\ncontrols could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or\nmultilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the\nability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nAdditional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to\nprovide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our\nrevenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our\nfulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example, regulators in\nChina are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against\ncustomers in the China market. If regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have\nviolated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on our ability to\nconduct our business, restrictions regarding our networking products and services, or otherwise impact our\noperations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions,\nimpacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing\nrequirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of\ncertain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture\ncertain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100\nintegrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and\nchip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for\ncertain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also\ninformed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to,\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments\nof our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule).\nBlackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and\ntherefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5,\nexcluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\nperformance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status. The AI\nDiffusion IFR would confer special benefits on select “Universal Verified End Users”, or UVEU, and lesser benefits\non “National Verified End Users”, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively\nimpact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by\nexpressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier\n1 countries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country.\nThese restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a\nselect number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own\naccelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG\nregulations, including foreign competition.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers’ costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges\nand risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and\nrelated extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from\nother countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR’s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a\ntimely manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside\nthe impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified\ncountries.\n27\nTable of Contents\nFollowing these 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and\nsupply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time\nconsuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our\nrevenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\nincluding those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent\nthat a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer.\nHowever, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or\nthat the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it\nmay impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG\nevaluates license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For\nexample, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products\nto customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted\nin license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models.\nThe requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\ndisadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new\nrestrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls,\nincluding further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase\nproduct from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual\nwarranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies\nlicenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested\nlicenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users\ncannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the\nlicensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain\nand encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in\nChina, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\nIFR. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer\nas a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be\nexported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling\nmechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use,\nor location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the\nUSG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our\nsupply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the\nU.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a\ngreater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our\nsupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed\nfrom Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand\nfor our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our\nnetworking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create\nlarge clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely\nhave a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips\nthat are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the\nfuture encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors\nfrom their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets\nworldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas\ngovernments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms,\nharming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls\nmay negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as\nEurope, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in\nU.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to\nnew unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in\nforeign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are\nsubject to worldwide licensing requirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase\nobligation charges.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate\ntechnologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering\nrestrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and\ninterpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to\ngames may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely\naffect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-\nbased competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products\ncontaining components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced\nrestrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours.\nAs another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards\nregarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data\ncenters in China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively\nprevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers\nto use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating\nresults and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could\nnegatively impact our business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners,\nespecially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of\ncomponents, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial\nresults.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could\nresult in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers\nto do business with us.\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and\ngovernment regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those\nassociated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate\nsustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in\nthe U.S. that may differ from other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations.\nAdditionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not\nmeet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate\nsustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and\nrequire additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices and\nlegal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not\nexpand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure\nmay negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in\nreputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services\nmay result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues.\nWe are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also\noffer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and\nchallenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw\ncontroversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended\nconsequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human\nrights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective\ninternal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered\nthrough our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.\nLeveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations may present further risks,\ncosts, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI may further\nincrease our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may impede\nour ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with\nregulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as\nthe European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional\nreporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code\nof Practice for General Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission\nregarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in\nAI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business\npractices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and\nregulations relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow\nadoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could\ninclude significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost\nprofits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless\nof their merit, could\n29\nTable of Contents\ncause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the\nefforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to\ninfringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP\nrights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could\nbe subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of\nour products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these\narrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result,\nthe value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We\nalso may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where\nto seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our\napplications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations.\nThese areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or\nresult in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws,\nregulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the\nprocessing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products\nand services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other\nprivacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely\naffect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our\npartners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or\nincreased security or remediation costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have\nenacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing\nspecific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data.\nAs applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-\nout of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making.\nThe exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain\nstates also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information,\nsuch as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance.\nFor example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020,\nor CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain\nsharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The\nCCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and the law created a private right of action for\ncertain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and\nlocal levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of AI and\nmachine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of\nenforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning\ndata protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nclasses of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may\ndisproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices. Additionally,\nEurope’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, regulates resilience and incident response\ncapabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital infrastructure sector. Non-\ncompliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative fines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up to 2% of the total\nworldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the\nUnited States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border\npersonal data\n30\nTable of Contents\ntransfer laws. For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The\nEuropean Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer\npersonal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate\nlevel of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement /\nAddendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers\nto relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms\nare subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to\nlawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar\ncross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the\ncost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes\nvarious requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under\nChina’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and\napproval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC\nassessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using\ndata collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal\ndata to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to\ncollaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require\nus to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some\nEuropean regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating\nthe GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to\ncomply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain\nprivacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on\ntheir service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach\nexposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation,\nregulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as\ncompliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security.\nRegulators in the U.S. are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or\nstatements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our\npractices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our\nproduct design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any\nthird parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may\nfail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data\nprivacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government\nenforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal\ndata, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes\nin tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other\ntax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe\nour tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the\namount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net\nincome, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could\nincrease our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of\noperations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with a significant\nportion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates\nincrease or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and\ncash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the\njurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of international tax developments, including\nthe implementation of the Two-Pillar framework led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or\nOECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain multinational enterprises above a\nfixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as Pillar One), and imposes a\nminimum effective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which we conduct\nbusiness have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, elements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, or\nchanges in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect our provision\nfor income taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives,\ncredits and deductions,\n31\nTable of Contents\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon\nfinalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred\ntax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or\nregulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or\ninternational organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-\nbased compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period\nin which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based\ncompensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory\nproceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.\nFor example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we\nand certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently\nuncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from\nmanufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies,\nsuch as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse\nimpact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to\ncreate and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without\nprior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent; advance notice\nrequirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and super-majority voting requirement to amend\nsome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if\nsomeone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last\nrights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA,\ndiscourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to\ncause us to take other corporate actions they desire."

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and\nreactively address circumstances that arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These\ninclude processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our\ninformation security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001\ninternational standard for Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We\nconsult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk\nmanagement and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and\nprocesses, and we have in place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new\nrequirements in global privacy and cybersecurity laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover\nfrom identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the\nsupplier and data they process on our behalf, the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to\nhelp us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to\nconfidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have\nimplemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these\nvendors, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data they process on our behalf. We routinely\nassess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we\nevaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.\nRefer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about cybersecurity-\nrelated risks.\n32\nTable of Contents\nGovernance\nInformation security matters, including managing and assessing risks from cybersecurity threats, remain under the\noversight of the Company’s Board of Directors, or the Board. The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit\nCommittee, also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s information security policies and practices\nand the internal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information\nsecurity updates from management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 21,\n2025, we had approximately 842 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIn May 2024, we announced a ten-for-one stock split, or the Stock Split, of our issued common stock, which was\neffected through the filing of an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the\nAmendment, with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. In June 2024, the Company filed the Amendment to effect the\nStock Split and proportionately increased the number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock from 8.0\nbillion to 80.0 billion. Shareholders of record at the close of market on June 6, 2024 received nine additional\nshares of common stock, distributed after the close of market on June 7, 2024. All share, equity award and per\nshare amounts presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for\n$34.0 billion. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to\n$38.7 billion of our common stock.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan or in structured share repurchase agreements in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act,\nsubject to\n33\nTable of Contents\nmarket conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.

                "content": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and\ndigital twin applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated\ncomputing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We\nbegan shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\nor supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated\ncomputing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased\ndemand for our Data Center systems.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and\nmay continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future\nproducts. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our\nsupply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning,\nexecution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead\nto increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing\nindustry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing\nand diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center\nsolutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center\nofferings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create\nvolatility in our revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in\nquality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in\nproduct delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product\nroadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may\ndelay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new\nproducts as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have\nmanaged prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions\nare difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur\nadditional costs.\nGlobal Trade\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China\n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23,\n2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100,\nA800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems,\nsuch as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a\nlicense for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that\npartners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not\nrequire a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China\nthat do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in fiscal year 2025. As a\npercentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in\nOctober 2023. The market in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with\nexport controls while serving our customers. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the\nlicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\nlicense, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\nperformance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given\nthe increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\nIFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that\nincorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive\ncustomers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain\nconstraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on\nour results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these\nmacroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment\nand value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes\nin our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIsrael and Regional Conflicts\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global supply chain for our\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Some of our employees in the region have been on\nactive military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our\nproduct development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however,\nif the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and\nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nFiscal Year 2025 Summary\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025          Jan 28, 2024       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                        130,497       $        60,922               Up 114%\nGross margin                                                75.0  %               72.7  %            Up 2.3 pts\nOperating expenses              $                         16,405       $        11,329               Up 45%\nOperating income                $                         81,453       $        32,972               Up 147%\nNet income                      $                         72,880       $        29,760               Up 145%\nNet income per diluted share    $                           2.94       $          1.19               Up 147%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago.\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 142% from a year ago. The strong year-on-year growth was driven by\ndemand for our Hopper architecture accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation\nengines, and generative AI applications. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 21% from a year ago, driven by the continued ramp of\nAda RTX GPU workstations for use cases such as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and engineering development, compute and infrastructure\ncosts for new product introductions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related\ndisclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nestimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We\nhave critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory\nprovisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase\n38\nTable of Contents\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\nour products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for\nexisting products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in\nadvance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in\ndemand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an\nunfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase\ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times\nand constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve\nmonths for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance\nof our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also\nadjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product\ntransitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application\nof complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added\ncertainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign\njurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities\nfor potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,\nadditional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional\nincome tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not\nto be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-\nlikely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return\nrights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of\nprior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns\nfor credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in\nrevenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer\nprograms include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes\nwhich require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant\ninternal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services\nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to\ndate as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each\nproject includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs\nas applicable.\n39\nTable of Contents\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each\nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements,\nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration\nor interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered\ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone\nselling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not\nsell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other\nobservable inputs.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal\nyear 2024 is presented below.

Revenue from Data Center computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing\nplatform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Revenue from Data\nCenter networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet\nplatform.\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nReportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income\nwas driven by growth in revenue. The year over year decrease in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an\nincrease of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in revenue.\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense\nreflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\nConcentration of Revenue\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors,\nODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and\nmay use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect\ncustomers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet\ncompanies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nDirect Customers – Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were\nprimarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment, are presented in the following table:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\nDirect Customer A              12  %                  *\nDirect Customer B              11  %              13  %\nDirect Customer C              11  %                  *\n* Less than 10% of total revenue.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIndirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer\npurchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect\ncustomer revenue may differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily\npurchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is\nestimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of\ncustomers, and this trend may continue.\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to\nindirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted\nfor 53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of\nsemiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing\nsupport costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and\nwarranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes\nacquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements,\nIP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase\nwas primarily driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal\nyears 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory\npurchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal years 2025 and\n2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years\n2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended                                     $         %\nJan 26, 2025          Jan 28, 2024          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $          12,914       $         8,675       $   4,239        49  %\n% of net revenue                                   9.9  %               14.2  %\nSales, general and administrative                3,491                 2,654             837        32  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                   2.7  %                4.4  %\nTotal operating expenses             $          16,405       $        11,329       $   5,076        45  %\n% of net revenue                                  12.6  %               18.6  %\nThe increases in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2025 were driven by a 32% increase in\ncompensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation\nincreases, a 100% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 234% increase in engineering development costs for\nnew product introductions.\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2025 were primarily driven by\ncompensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation\nincreases.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended                               $\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Change\n-$ in millions\nInterest income                $           1,786    $           866    $     920\nInterest expense                            -247               -257           10\nOther, net                                 1,034                237          797\nOther income (expense), net    $           2,573    $           846    $   1,727\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nOther, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in\nOther, net, compared to fiscal year 2024, was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our non-marketable\nequity securities and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our non-\nmarketable equity securities.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $11.1 billion and $4.1 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax as a\npercentage of income before income tax was an expense of 13.3% and 12.0% for fiscal years 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a prior year discrete benefit due to an\naudit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit,\nand income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax\nrate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the audit resolution.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated\nwith certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period\nthe release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our\nassessment of all available information.\nRefer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         8,589    $         7,280\nMarketable securities                              34,621             18,704\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        43,210    $        25,984\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating           $        64,089    $        28,090\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $       -20,421    $       -10,566\nNet cash used in financing activities    $       -42,359    $       -13,633\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of\ninvestment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, due to growth in\nrevenue.\nCash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by\nnet purchases of marketable securities, and purchase of land, property and equipment.\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher\nshare repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our\noperations. As of January 26, 2025, we had $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We\nbelieve that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months\nand thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We\ncontinuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we\ncan finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government\nand its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as\ncertificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item\n15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of\nfiscal year 2025 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for\n$34.0 billion. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to\n$38.7 billion of our common stock.\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a\npre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees\nwhile maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases\nas we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash\ndividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in\nthe best interests of our shareholders.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares\nissued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase\ncost and was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 26, 2025, by year payable, are as follows:\nJan 26, 2025\n-In millions\nDue in one year                                 $             —\nDue in one to five years                                  2,250\nDue in five to ten years                                  2,750\nDue in greater than ten years                             3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs                -37\nNet long-term carrying amount                   $         8,463\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to\nour analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for\nthese investments of $238 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face\nvalue less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we\nhave no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as substantially all of our\nsales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or\nexpenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not\nsignificant for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their manufacturing costs.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been $136 million and $116 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign\ncurrency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $129 million and $60 million as of January 26, 2025 and\nJanuary 28, 2024, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by\n45\nTable of Contents\ncorresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming\nthe hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information."

Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n26, 2025.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 26,\n2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update much of our\nexisting core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to\nreport operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there\nare changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n46\nTable of Contents"

Exhibits\nThe exhibits listed in the accompanying index to exhibits are filed or incorporated by          83\nreference as a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n49\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January\n26, 2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item\n15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the\nCompany’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was\n$30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s\napproach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii)\nthe consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose,

Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were\nall 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill,\nincome taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-\nmarketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges,\nrevenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment\nterms, is generally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of\nservices.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market\nsegment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We\naccount for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs\nbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with\nsupport, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates\nand upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the\ncustomer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession\nof the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.\nRevenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue\nrelated to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a\nstandalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a\nsingle contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely\nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the\nprice we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from oneto three yearsfor products to repair or replace products\nfor manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product\nwarranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an\nextended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification\nissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on\nour corporate financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the\nfair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs.\nThe compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over\nthe requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be\nissued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an\noffering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an\naccelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected\nforfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or\nsubstantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a\nloss in any of our pending litigation,\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we\nwill record the loss. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially\ndifferent from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that a loss is\nreasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and\nliabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and\nexpenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-\nmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been\nsignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts\nor circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies\nbased on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that\npayment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we\nmay be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\naccordingly.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and\ncertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part,\nto jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax\nbenefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity\nawards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held equity securities.\nWe classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in\ncurrent operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale.\nThese available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The\nfair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of\nmarketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income\n(expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-\nsale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by\nexpected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we\nwill be required or we intend to\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nsell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are\nrecognized in the Other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPublicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other\nincome (expense), net.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Marketable\ndebt and equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are\nrecognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value\nhedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses\nor gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a\ncomponent of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure\nis recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value\nare recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is\ncomputed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of twoto seven years.\nOnce an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or\namortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to\nthirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold\nimprovements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or\nthe estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\n60\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a\nquantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from\npublicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding\nindustry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer\nrelationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently\namortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that\nreflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or,\nif that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected\nto be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its\nestimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and\nliabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would\nbe reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be\ndepreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the\npurchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and\nassumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount\nrate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently\nuncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement\nperiod of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value. These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in\nthe same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market\nand the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All\ngains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on\nour Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted\nfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is\nidentified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard requiring\ndisclosures of significant expenses in operating segments. We adopted this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual\nreport. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for further information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures,\nincluding disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this\nstandard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material\nimpact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense\ninformation on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory,\nemployee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense\ncaption, as applicable. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect\nthe adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than\nadditional disclosures.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to\nsignificant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition\ntermination cost of $ 1.4billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at\nsigning.\nNote 3 - Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is associated with RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.\nConsolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into\ninventory and subsequently recognized to cost of revenue, as follows:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nCost of revenue                      $           178    $           141    $           138\nResearch and development                       3,423              2,532              1,892\nSales, general and administrative              1,136                876                680\nTotal                                $         4,737    $         3,549    $         2,710\nStock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nThe following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions, except per share\ndata\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs\nAwards granted                                                         89                140                250\nEstimated total grant-date fair     $                               7,834    $         5,316    $         4,505\nvalue\nWeighted average grant-date fair\nvalue                               $                               87.99    $         37.41    $         18.37\nper share\nESPP\nShares purchased                                                       30                 30                 30\nWeighted average price per share    $                               17.74    $         15.81    $         12.25\nWeighted average grant-date fair\nvalue                               $                                8.61    $          6.99    $          5.19\nper share\nAs of January 26, 2025, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $ 11.6billion, which is expected to\nbe recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one yearfor\nESPP.\nThe fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025                      Jan 28, 2024    Jan 29, 2023\n-Using the Black-Scholes model\nESPP\nWeighted average expected life (in    0.1-2.0                           0.1-2.0         0.1-2.0\nyears)\nRisk-free interest rate               3.6%-5.4%                         3.9%-5.5%       —%-4.6%\nVolatility                            31%-75%                           31%-67%         43%-72%\nDividend yield                        0.03%                             0.06%           0.09%\nFor ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the\npurchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSUs,\nPSUs, and market-based PSUs are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of\nRSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical\nforfeitures.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In\naddition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards\ngranted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended\nand restated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to\nemployees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. We grant RSUs, PSUs\nand market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan. As of January 26, 2025, up to 274million shares of our common stock\ncould be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, and 1.4billion shares were available for\nfuture grants.\n63\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs vest generally over four years subject to continued service. PSUs vest over\nfour years, subject to continued service and performance conditions. Market-based PSUs vest on the third\nanniversary of the date of grant subject to market conditions. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs\nand market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of\npre-determined criteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently\namended and restated, the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. Starting in March 2025, employees may have up to 25% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion.

Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts greater than one year in length\nwill be recognized over the next twelve months.\nNote 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on\nour operating expenses. The foreign currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting\nhedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and\nreclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. In fiscal years\n2025 and 2024, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other\ncomprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.\nWe also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on\nmonetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair\nvalue of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair\nvalue of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other\nincome or expense.\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nDesignated as accounting hedges        $         1,424    $         1,168\nNot designated as accounting hedges    $         1,297    $           597\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of January\n26, 2025 and January 28, 2024.\nAs of January 26, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within 18months. The expected realized gains and\nlosses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts\nwithin the next twelve months were not significant.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 11 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nExpected    Effective\nRemaining Term (years)    Interest Rate       Jan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\n0.584% Notes Due 2024 (1)                              —    0.66%            $             —    $         1,250\n3.20% Notes Due 2026                                 1.6    3.31%                      1,000              1,000\n1.55% Notes Due 2028                                 3.4    1.64%                      1,250              1,250\n2.85% Notes Due 2030                                 5.2    2.93%                      1,500              1,500\n2.00% Notes Due 2031                                 6.4    2.09%                      1,250              1,250\n3.50% Notes Due 2040                                15.2    3.54%                      1,000              1,000\n3.50% Notes Due 2050                                25.2    3.54%                      2,000              2,000\n3.70% Notes Due 2060                                35.2    3.73%                        500                500\nUnamortized debt discount and\nissuance                                                                                 -37                -41\ncosts\nNet carrying amount                                                                    8,463              9,709\nLess short-term portion                                                                    —             -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                                                      $         8,463    $         8,459\n(1) In fiscal year 2025, we repaid the 0.584% Notes Due 2024.\nOur notes are unsecured senior obligations.

We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that\nallow them to procure inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are\ncancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business needs prior to placing firm orders. Though,\nchanges to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $\n14.3billion, including $ 10.9billion of multi-year cloud service agreements.

The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without\nleave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an\nappeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August\n25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district\ncourt’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the\nNinth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on\nOctober 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending\nNVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final\ndisposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the\nSupreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument,\nthe Supreme\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nCourt dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on\nJanuary 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August\n28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of\nus, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of\ncorporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination\nof allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining\non GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements\nto NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment\ndismissing the Company’s petition for writ of certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation\nSecurities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30days while the parties discuss next steps\nand ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on\nbehalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust\nenrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a),\n10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified\ndamages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate\ngovernance measures.\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,\ncaptioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of\nus, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on\nthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This\nderivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 26, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described\nabove based on our belief that liabilities, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss\nor range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.4billion of cumulative undistributed\nearnings held by certain subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for\ntemporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of both January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion related to capital\nloss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be\nrealized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the\nextent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax\nassets as income tax benefits during the period.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated\nwith certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period\nthe release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our\nassessment of all available information.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 479million, $\n332million and $ 349million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years\n2026 and 2027, respectively.

The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income\ntaxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We\nrecognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our\nconsolidated statements of income of $ 92million, $ 42million, and $ 33million during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and\n2023, respectively. As of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we have accrued $ 251million and $ 140million,\nrespectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included\nas a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 26, 2025, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably\npossible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26,\n2025, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States for fiscal\nyears after 2021, as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal\nyears 2014 through 2024. As of January 26, 2025, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under\nexamination include Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2014 through 2024, and the State\nof California for fiscal years 2020 to 2022.\nNote 14 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $ 50billion to our share repurchase\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 310million and 210million shares\nof our common stock for $ 34.0billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized,\nsubject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $ 38.7billion of our common stock. Our share repurchase\nprogram aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our\noperating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment\nopportunities.\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29million shares for $ 3.7billion pursuant to a\npre-established trading plan.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nIn fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $ 834million, $ 395million, and\n$ 398million, respectively. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing\ndetermination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.\nNote 15 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $ 314million, $ 255million, and $ 227million,\nrespectively.\nNote 16 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and reviews financial information\npresented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our\nCODM assesses operating performance of each segment based on regularly provided segment revenue and segment\noperating income. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and\ncosts or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our\ntwosegments. Our CODM reviews expenses on a consolidated basis, and expenses attributable to each segment are not\nregularly provided to our CODM.\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and AI solutions and\nsoftware; networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and\nother embedded platforms; and DGX Cloud computing services.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and\nOmniverse Enterprise software for building and operating industrial AI and digital twin applications.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that are not allocated to either Compute & Networking or Graphics\nfor purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based\ncompensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, and other\nnon-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis.
