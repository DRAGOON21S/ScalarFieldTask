BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nWe provide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how\npeople interact. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing and\nenable face-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and\nlocations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice that is easy to use, manage,\nand deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces and\napplications. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and\ntrust. We strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that\n“just works.”\nThe cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features\ndesigned to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users are comprised of\nboth hosts who organize video meetings and the individual attendees who participate in those video meetings. In\n2019, we launched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications platform. Many\ncustomers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users to\neasily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. Our partner ecosystem, which includes App\nMarketplace and in-product apps, and developer platform help enterprises create elevated experiences with third-\nparty applications to create customized workflows.\nThe happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites,\nincluding Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2020 Gartner Peer\nInsights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions and a TrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software. Industry\nanalysts also recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting\nSolutions based on our “ability to execute” and “completeness of vision.” In 2020 we also became a Leader in the\nGartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS. Frost & Sullivan recognized Zoom with its Global Connected Work Company of the\nYear award in 2020, as well as awards for Global Video Communications in The COVID-19 Crisis Enabling Technology\nLeadership, Asia-Pacific Cloud Video Collaboration Services Company of The Year, and Indian Cloud Video Enabling\nTechnology Leadership.\nWe have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy\nfor optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience our platform – it just works.\nThis enthusiasm continues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our\ncustomers. Our sales efforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer\nopportunity, which can include our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that\ndelights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these\npractices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our\nexisting customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nhosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the\ndifference of Zoom. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that\nintegrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales\nrepresentatives, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively\ndrive upgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our video platform and become familiar with its\nbenefits, more teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of\nbusiness and then organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our\nlargest deployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, and phone for the full\nZoom Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) experience.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of video communication and\ncollaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of\n6\nTable of Contents\nengineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base.\nAccelerate international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world,\nwe are poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems.\nGrow our partnership ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Our platform integrates easily with other\nsystems and tools. We enable developers to embed our platform into their own offerings through open application\nprogram interfaces (“APIs”) and our cross-platform software development kits (“SDKs”). We have already partnered\nwith several hardware video conferencing and peripheral providers and with software providers, including Atlassian\nand Dropbox. Third-party developers are able to engage with the Zoom App Marketplace and Zoom Developer Platform to\nextend the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development of public and private apps and\nintegrations.\nOur Products\nWe provide a unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact,\nconnecting them through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing. Our core products include\nZoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Chat, Zoom Rooms, Zoom Conference Room Connector, Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom\nDeveloper Platform, and Zoom App Marketplace.\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provide HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems. Our architecture can support up to one thousand video participants in a\nsingle meeting. Conversations can be one to one, one to many, or many to many. Zoom Meetings feature 49-person\nvideo gallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms,\nscreen sharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more\ndone together. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Dropbox, Google,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees who rely on\ntheir mobile device or tablet throughout their business day.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is now available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host\nmeetings with up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings\nby default, but with Zoom’s new E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography\nto distribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nZoom Phone\nZoom Phone is an enterprise cloud phone system that provides powerful private branch exchange (“PBX”) features,\nsuch as secure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail,\nswitch to video, and much more. Available stand alone, or as an optional add-on to Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone is a\ncore component of our modern video-first UCaaS strategy that enables customers to replace their existing PBX\nsolution and consolidate all of their business communications and collaboration requirements onto Zoom.\nZoom Phone provides inbound and outbound calling via its support for native connectivity to the public switched\ntelephone network (“PSTN”). In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, Zoom Phone provided native PSTN connectivity\nin 44 countries and territories including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom\n(“U.K.”), and the United States (“U.S.”).\nZoom Phone also supports Premise Peering and Cloud Peering, which provide enterprise customers with the flexibility\nof keeping their current PSTN service providers by redirecting existing third-party voice circuits to the Zoom\nPhone cloud. Hybrid connectivity is also supported, allowing customers to mix native Zoom Phone Calling Plans and\nthird-party voice circuits. This unique capability allows customers to enjoy all of the benefits and features of\nZoom Phone while keeping their existing service provider contracts, phone numbers, and calling rates with their\npreferred carrier of record.\nZoom Chat\nZoom Chat, which is included in the Zoom client for meeting and phone customers, enables organizations and teams to\ncommunicate and collaborate in groups, channels, or 1-1s and to stay connected by instantly sharing messages,\nimages, audio files, and other content across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. With Zoom Chat users can\neasily invite people outside a user’s organization to a chat conversation, and users can quickly switch from a chat\nto a phone call or video meeting\n7\nTable of Contents\nduring a conversation. Zoom Chat also features content storage for users who want discoverability and the ability\nto review their conversations or shared files. There are dozens of Zoom Chat compatible applications available in\nthe Zoom App Marketplace that provide notifications and improved workflow for other enterprise systems.\nZoom Rooms\nZoom Rooms is our software-based conference room system that transforms every room–from executive offices, huddle\nrooms, training rooms, to broadcast studios–into a collaboration space that is easy to use, simple to deploy, and\neffortless to manage. Designed to increase workforce collaboration across in-room and virtual participants, Zoom\nRooms bring one-click to join meetings, wireless multi-sharing, interactive whiteboarding, and intuitive room\ncontrols for a frictionless and secure Zoom Meeting experience. Zoom Rooms can leverage purpose-built hardware,\nsuch as Zoom Rooms Appliances, for a turnkey deployment, or customize room builds with Zoom’s open hardware\necosystem and professional audio/visual equipment, enabling organizations to build video conference rooms for any\nuse case.\nZoom Rooms Scheduling Display helps meet the needs of the agile office by delivering simple, on-the-fly room\nbooking and room utilization management through a calendaring system. With a single Zoom Rooms license, customers\nget unlimited access to this service, requiring only an iOS or Android touch display outside their rooms.\nZoom Rooms Digital Signage leverages displays, in and out of conference rooms, to project image, video, and URL\ncontent playlists. Included as part of Zoom Rooms, role-based admins can easily manage unlimited Digital Signage\ncontent and displays through the Zoom Admin Portal and remotely control the content displayed across screens for\ncorporate communications, internal marketing, branding, and more.\nZoom Conference Room Connector\nThe Zoom Conference Room Connector is a gateway for SIP/H.323 endpoints to join Zoom meetings. For organizations\nthat use SIP/H.323 conference room systems from providers, such as Poly and Cisco, Zoom’s Conference Room Connector\ncan take these traditional hardware video conferencing systems to the cloud, allowing users to leverage their\nexisting investments while taking advantage of the Zoom platform. As organizations transition from legacy hardware-\nbased conference rooms to software-based Zoom Rooms, IT administrators save cost on layers of service, maintenance,\nand support contracts and bridge their endpoints with Zoom Conference Room Connector. With the cost-savings,\norganizations can reinvest in video-enabling more rooms and continue to leverage their existing SIP/H.323 endpoints\nwith a consistent, cloud-based experience across all their rooms.\nZoom Video Webinars\nZoom Video Webinars support interactive video presentations to large audiences from almost anywhere in the world\nand from many devices. Zoom webinars scale up to 50,000 people including up to 100 interactive video panelists.\nWith webinars, hosts have control over the video viewing experience and attendees join to listen, learn and\ninteract using chat, Q&A, live polling and more. Our powerful third-party integrations help users maximize usage of\ntheir webinars and expand capabilities with paid registration, marketing automation, lead nurturing and learning\nmanagement.\nZoom Developer Platform and Zoom App Marketplace\nZoom Developer Platform allows developers to integrate our video, phone, chat, and content sharing into other\napplications, as well as manage Zoom accounts from any system, with full access to their usage and network metrics\ndata. With our SDKs, APIs and webhooks, Zoom, third-party developers, and partners build applications that\nintegrate our platform with other cloud services. Our customers can also develop highly customizable private\napplications that integrate Zoom into their systems. Our rich toolbox of extensible APIs, cross-platform SDKs, and\nMobileRTC powered an average of more than 1.6 billion API engagements per month for calendar year 2020.\nOur App Marketplace brings together these integrations built by Zoom and third-party developers, making it easy for\ndevelopers to publish their apps and for customers to enhance their Zoom experience with new functionalities. We\nfully vet apps in our marketplace for security and user experience. Zoom App Marketplace features apps and bots\nwith services such as Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, and Google, as well as deep product integrations with Dropbox,\nBox, Atlassian, and Marketo.\nOnZoom and Zoom Apps\nWe recently announced two additions to the Zoom platform: OnZoom and Zoom Apps. OnZoom is a new platform for Zoom\nusers to create, host, and monetize online events. OnZoom is an extension of Zoom’s unified communications platform\nwith robust monetization (ticketing and fundraising) and simpler event management capabilities. OnZoom is currently\noffered as a public beta for U.S. users to host and attend online events. Zoom Apps are a new app type coming soon\nto the Zoom App\n8\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace. These in-product integrations will be accessible directly from Zoom Meetings and the Zoom Desktop\nclient and are designed to facilitate collaboration and engagement during meetings.\nZoom Hardware-as-a-Service\nOur Zoom Hardware-as-a-Service offering allows customers to access the latest and greatest video communication\ntechnology. Customers can deploy a world-class communications experience with a variety of subscription options for\nphone and meeting room hardware. Zoom customers will be able to scale video conference rooms and phones with\nhardware options and hardware refreshes at an affordable, fixed monthly price.\nOur Technology and Infrastructure\nOur unique technology and infrastructure enable best-in-class reliability, scalability, and performance. We\ndesigned our communications platform to be video-first and cloud-native. Most legacy approaches utilize single\nmultipoint control units (“MCUs”) to bridge video and voice participants into an integrated stream that is\nbroadcast back to the participants. These hardware devices are shipped with defined processing and memory capacity\nthat are difficult to scale. In addition, an MCU architecture is similar to other mainframe-like approaches where\nstream processing and mixing run on the same machine, which is resource-intensive and limits scalability.\nOur technology was specifically designed from the start to address the most difficult component of communications:\nvideo. Video requires intense computing resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, as\nwell as higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like\nvoice, chat, and content sharing. Our architecture separates video content processing from the transporting and\nmixing of streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that reside on client devices and\ndynamically encode and decode based upon the performance of client technology, network performance, and bandwidth.\nWe leverage a next-generation multimedia router that operates on commodity hardware and a globally distributed\ncloud infrastructure to determine the optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect\nthe participants.\nOur Customers\nWe have customers of all sizes, from individuals to global Fortune 50 organizations. Our current customer base\nspans numerous industry categories, including education, entertainment/media, enterprise infrastructure, finance,\ngovernment, health care, manufacturing, non-profit/not for profit and social impact, retail/consumer products, and\nsoftware/internet. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 467,100 customers with more than 10 employees.\nSales\nOur sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meeting plan with a sales approach optimized\nfor the size of each customer opportunity. Our direct sales force includes our field sales representatives as well\nas our inside sales team, and it is organized by customer employee count and vertical. Our channel team coordinates\nthe activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong ecosystem that broadens our reach. Our online\nchannel supports high-volume, high-velocity, self-service sales.\nMarketing\nOur marketing team’s primary objective is to create preference for our brand by leveraging our viral growth,\nenhancing brand perception, and engaging our users with virtual events, social media, and customer advisory\ncouncils. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out-of-home advertising. We shifted our events\nstrategy from in-person to online during the pandemic, including hosting Zoomtopia, our annual user conference, to\nover 150,000 unique virtual attendees.\nResearch and Development\nWe drive our business with constant innovation. We have research and development presence in the United States,\nIndia, Singapore and China, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to invest more in\nincreasing our product capabilities in an efficient manner with a “follow the sun” strategy.\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and LogMeIn GoToMeeting, and bundled productivity solution providers with video\nfunctionality, including Google G Suite and Microsoft Teams, as well as UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including\n8x8. Avaya, and RingCentral.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:\nvideo-first platform;\ncloud-native architecture;\nfunctionality and scalability;\nease of use and reliability;\nbrand awareness and preference;\nability to utilize existing infrastructure, such as legacy conference room hardware; and\nlow total cost of ownership.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections,\nto establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions\noriginating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the\nUnited States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and\nexternal controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. This may\ninclude open source software. We take steps to ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses governing such\nlicensed technology. We believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark,\ncopyright, trade secret, license, or other intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated\nwith our intellectual property, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on\nour capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nNevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those\npertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material\nimpact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government\nregulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had 4,422 full-time employees. Of these employees, 2,662 are in the United States and\n1,760 are in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by\ncollective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.\nOur Culture of Happiness\nWe are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We strive to change the way business is done\nthrough our communications technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we have an\nemployee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify our efforts to deliver happiness to our\nemployees and customers.\nOur culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision, and values and is fundamental to everything we do\nat Zoom:\nMission. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nVision. Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video communications.\nValues. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves.\nThis culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent.\nComparably recognized Zoom for numerous culture awards in 2020 including Best Company Happiness and Best CEO. Our\nemployees also named Zoom among the winners of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Awards honoring the Best Places to\nWork in 2021.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) at Zoom is an embodiment of our core value of Care. DEI also represents our\nintentional effort to create an inclusive environment of the brightest minds from a broad set of backgrounds in\norder to create the most innovative solutions for our customers. Our approach to DEI is driven across four\nstrategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how\nwe include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).\nIn June, we hired our first Chief Diversity Officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, to lead our DEI function globally. We\nhave taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College, AnitaB.org\nand a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, we launched our Zoom Talks\ninitiative to create ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about each other's unique backgrounds. We also\nlaunched our inaugural Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) program with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women's, Veterans and\nLGBTQ+ communities. Our DEI Team continues to partner with teams leading our product design and marketing to invest\nin making our products even more inclusive and accessible to the diverse set of communities we serve. Finally, in\nan effort to both further our education internally and provide others outside of Zoom with an opportunity to learn,\nwe created the nine-part learning series, “Race in the Workplace”, in partnership with TIME and renowned expert,\nDr. Shaun Harper.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. Our employees’\ntotal compensation packages include base pay, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best\ninterest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of\nour employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-\nsite work. We also provide flexible work hours in certain cases. We have also provided a work-from-home\nreimbursement policy to assist employees in that transition.\nOur Facilities\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Jose, California, where we lease approximately 103,000 square feet of\ncommercial space pursuant to operating leases that expire in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2030. In addition,\nwe maintain additional offices in the United States and internationally in Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) and Europe, Middle\nEast, and Africa (“EMEA”). We believe that our facilities are suitable to meet our current needs.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2011 under the name Saasbee, Inc., and in\nFebruary 2012, we changed our name to Zoom Communications, Inc.

                "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers and hosts, retain and upsell additional products to\nexisting customers, and upgrade free hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers and hosts, renewals,\nor upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and maintain and expand our relationships\nwith our customers and hosts, including upselling additional products to our existing customers and upgrading hosts\nto a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting\nand invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting\nplan as “paid hosts.”\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers\nwill renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,\nor purchase additional products, if they renew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or\nfluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no\nlonger having a need for our products, including any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic that may subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic\nhas tapered, or the perception that competitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In\naddition, some customers downgrade their Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the increased usage of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted from\nlargely businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could\nresult in higher non-renewal rates than we have experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and\nhosts to grow our business beyond our current user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to\ncontinue to use our platform. Finally, any decrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm\nour brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by\nrecommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand\nwithin organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\nZoom into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we strive to demonstrate the value\nof our platform and various product offerings to those hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan, thereby\nencouraging them to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including those that\nrecently subscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and work-from-\nhome mandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts\nof our free Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within organizations, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nIn addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase and we\nturn our focus to upgrading our free hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan rather than growing the total number of\nusers. If we are not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or\ndecline. Similar to the uncertainty of customers renewing their subscriptions or hosts upgrading to a paid Zoom\nMeeting plan, we expect our user growth rate to slow or decline once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic tapers,\nparticularly as a vaccine becomes widely available, and users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer\nsubject to shelter-in-place mandates.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors,\nincluding increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, would impair the delivery of our services, require\nus to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers in\norder to optimize performance on our platform. Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past\nresulted in and could in the future result in interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, other interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety\nof other factors, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors,\nviruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in\nusage, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that\nimpacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new\ndata centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or\ntransfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite\nprecautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in\nthe delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay\npenalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause customers and hosts to terminate their\nsubscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts. Our ability to attract and\nretain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide customers and hosts with a highly reliable platform\nand even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, including increased\nusage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek\nto obtain additional capacity, which could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications\nplatform because of its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers\nto meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner,\nincluding as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term\ncapacity needs, we may need to rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and\nOracle Cloud, which may result in higher variable costs and harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and similar events, any of which could disrupt\nour service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant\nperiod of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for\nall eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of\nterrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other\nunanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain\nfeatures of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products\noffered by:\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and LogMeIn GoToMeeting;\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect\ncompetition to intensify in the future. For example, we recently introduced Zoom Phone, a cloud phone system that\nallows customers to replace their existing PBX solution, which will result in increased competition against\ncompanies that offer similar services and new competitors that may enter that market in the future. Also, in\nconnection with the travel restrictions and stay-in-place policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have\nseen a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from smaller customers, many of whom are consumers or small\nand medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller customers, we face competition from more consumer-\noriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the consumer market than we do. Further, many of our\nactual and potential competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater name\n13\nTable of Contents\nrecognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and services; larger marketing budgets; more\nestablished marketing relationships; third-party integration; greater accessibility across devices or applications;\naccess to larger user bases; major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater\nfinancial, technical, and other resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic\nrelationships to offer a broader range of products and services than we do. These combinations may make it more\ndifficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or\nmaintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nforced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on\noccasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in\ndeferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts\nreceivable.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any\nprior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. We expect our revenue growth rate to\ngenerally decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher\nmarket penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our platform, especially once the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic tapers, particularly as a vaccine becomes widely available, and users return to work or school or\nare otherwise no longer subject to shelter-in-place mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth\nopportunities, and the maturation of our business, among others. If our growth rate declines, investors’\nperceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our\nbusiness.\nOur quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our\nresults of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon\nas an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety\nof factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business. For example, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced\nunprecedented usage of our unified communications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant\nportion of which is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased\ndemand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our\ninfrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on\npublic cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the\nvalue of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include,\nwithout limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our\npaid Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\n14\nTable of Contents\nthe length of our sales cycles, especially with respect to sales to large enterprises and highly-regulated\nindustries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases; and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service; network outages; or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits; regulatory actions or investigations; legislator scrutiny; or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users grow and their usage\nof communications capacity increases, including increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be\nrequired to make additional investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the\navailability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity\nis not available to us as our user base grows, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high\ndata transmission capacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third\nparties providing internet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not\nhave access to our platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate\nof adoption of new technologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently\nadapt to the increased demand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause\ncurrent or potential users to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our\ncompetitors or to avoid our platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The\norder requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management\npractices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient\nto enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and\nother small businesses to develop,\n15\nTable of Contents\nmarket, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11, 2018. Numerous parties filed\njudicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to the new rules, but reversed the\nFCC's decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet service, requiring case-\nby-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC's rules. The court also\nrequired the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to remain in effect, while the FCC\nconducts that review. On February 6, 2020, the court denied requests for rehearing of the original decision, and\nthe deadline for petitions requesting the Supreme Court to review the decision has passed without the filing of any\nsuch petitions. On February 19, 2020, the FCC released a public notice asking for comment on the three issues the\ncourt required it to reexamine. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that the three issues\nremanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order. Petitions for\nreconsideration of this decision are pending. Democratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC\nfollowing the 2020 elections increases the likelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or\nadopt new network neutrality rules. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering\nlegislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. On February 23, 2021, a\nfederal court judge denied a request for injunction against California’s state-specific network neutrality law, and\nas a result, California will soon begin enforcing that law. On March 10, 2021, trade associations representing\ninternet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction. We cannot\npredict whether the FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by\nlegal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the new rules, broadband internet access\nproviders may be able to charge web-based services such as ours for priority access or favor services offered by\nour competitors or by the internet access providers themselves, which could result in increased costs and a loss of\nexisting customers and hosts, impair our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater\ndeployment challenges.\nAs we continue to grow, we have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large\norganizations typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size,\norganizational structure, and approval requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face\nunexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large\norganizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional\nsecurity management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large\norganizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our\nplatform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we\nanticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater\nunpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if any new customers or hosts that have\nsubscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the\nimpact of the pandemic has tapered, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\nease of adoption and use;\n16\nTable of Contents\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past, and we expect to increase our expenses in the future, which could\nprevent us from maintaining profitability.\nAlthough we generated net income of $672.3 million, $25.3 million and $7.6 million for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, we have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses\nin the future. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing\nefforts to attract new customers and hosts and to develop and enhance our products and for general corporate\npurposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses,\nupgrading our infrastructure, and addressing security and privacy issues, including those stemming from the\nunprecedented numbers of first-time users during the COVID-19 pandemic who may not have full IT support or\nestablished protocols like our enterprise customers, and expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we\nare successful in increasing our user base, we may also incur increased losses because, other than sales\ncommissions, the costs associated with acquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the\nsubscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or\non a multiyear basis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to\nincrease our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future\nfor a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses,\ndifficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. For example, we have faced unprecedented usage\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and, to meet this increased demand, have incurred and expect to continue to incur\nsignificant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher\nvariable costs to the extent we have to rely on public cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Despite\nthese significant investments, a majority of these new hosts using our platform on a free Basic account may never\nupgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we are unable to sustain profitability, the value of our business and Class\nA common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our\nmarket, customer demand for our platform, user adoption and renewal of our platform, the entry of competitive\nproducts and services, or the success of existing competitive products and services. As a result, we may not\nmaintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our\ninvestments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other\nproductivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors\nown, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute\noperating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform\nrequires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and\nservices that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business\npartners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with\n17\nTable of Contents\ntheir products or services. As our respective products evolve, we expect this level of competition to increase.\nShould any of our competitors modify their products or standards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our\nplatform or gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive\nposition or for any other reason, the interoperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. If we do not comply with these requirements, we could lose access to the\napp store and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from\ncustomers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and\nproducts; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.\nOur customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest\nsignificantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality\nand ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic user demand for our platform. For example,\nin October 2020 we introduced two new additions to our Zoom platform, OnZoom and Zoom Apps. There is no assurance\nthat these new additions or other future enhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or\ncapabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If\nour research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand or if we fail to develop our\nplatform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may\nfail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing\nthat could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,\nor capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and\ncapabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released\naccording to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or\nclaims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to\nour platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.\nIf customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not\nperform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,\nlicense, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such\nenhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and\nservices will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan\nto continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are\nunable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to\nacquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our\nefforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our\nnew sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our\nsales and marketing programs are not effective.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOur security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security\nmeasures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,\nexpose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products\nand services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or\nceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of customer and user data or information, and security\nincidents have occurred in the past, and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of, this information, regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, and other possible liabilities, as well as negative\npublicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales, and harm our business. Cyberattacks and other\nmalicious internet-based activity continue to increase, and cloud-based platform providers of products and services\nhave been and are expected to continue to be targeted. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” we face\nsecurity risks from malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing incidents, credential stuffing attacks,\nemployee theft, misuse of information or systems, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and\nadvanced persistent threat intrusions. Moreover, security incidents can result in interruptions, delays, or outages\nin our operations and services, including due to ransomware or denial-of-service attacks. Despite significant\nefforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. If\nour security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee, customer, host or user error,\nmalfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials, or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged; our\ndata, information or intellectual property, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise\ncompromised; our business may be harmed; and we could incur significant liability. We have not always been able in\nthe past and may be unable in the future to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit\nvulnerabilities in our services or software or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise\nour systems, because such threats and techniques change frequently and are generally not detected until after an\nincident has occurred. In addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue\nin the future to actively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services.\nThis activity may increase because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified\ncommunications platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the\nZoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software\naddressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by\nthese vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and\ntheir software is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security\nresearcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized\nperson to gain root access to a user’s system. We cannot be certain that we will be able to address any\nvulnerabilities in our software that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in developing\npatches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. We expect similar issues to arise in the\nfuture as our products and services are more widely adopted, and as we continue to expand the features and\nfunctionality of existing products and introduce new products. We expect to expend significant resources in an\neffort to protect against security incidents and to mitigate, detect, and remediate actual and potential\nvulnerabilities. Security incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security may cause some of our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or\nrenew their subscriptions. This discontinuance in use or failure to upgrade or renew could substantially harm our\nbusiness. Further, as we rely on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, we depend in part on third-party\nsecurity measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and the mishandling of data and\ninformation. In addition, failures to meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and\nconfidentiality of their data and information could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain\ncustomers and hosts, attract new customers and hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or\nsecurity vulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including\nclass action litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs\nfor remediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease\nin customer, host, and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs\nto address cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and\nsettlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because of any such incident.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving\ncertain types of personal data. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach\nis costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches. Security\ncompromises experienced by our competitors, our customers, or us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to\nwidespread negative publicity. In addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States,\nlike many similarly situated technology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel\nin China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and\nmedia scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.\nAny security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our\n19\nTable of Contents\nreputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures; negatively affect our ability to\nattract new customers and hosts; cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions; or subject us\nto third-party lawsuits, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and fines, or other action or liability, which\ncould harm our business and reputation. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional\nawareness of Zoom and our brand could lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative\nperception of our information security and potential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For example, in\nconnection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading\nto challenges for users who did not have full IT support or established protocols for security and privacy like our\nenterprise customers. As a result, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and\nsecurity and privacy issues, including on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in\nmaterial reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure,\nadditional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use\nor other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or\ndamages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance\ncoverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny\ncoverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are not\ncovered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including\npremium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our business.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that our brand identity and awareness have contributed to our success and have helped fuel our efficient\ngo-to-market strategy. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, voice, chat, and content sharing.\nWe also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers,\nhosts, and users and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad\ncommunications platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users incorrectly view the Zoom\nbrand primarily as a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform with multiple\ncommunications solutions, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market position may\nbe detrimentally impacted at such time as a competitor introduces a new or better product. We anticipate that, as\nour market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult\nand expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or perception of our platform, including any delays or interruptions in\nservice due to capacity constraints stemming from increased usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or of our privacy\nor security features, or of the providers of communication and collaboration technologies generally, could\nadversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain hosts. Similarly, any unfavorable perception\nof our company, including due to any actual or perceived violation by our employees of our policies, such as our\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause us reputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial\nperformance, expose us to litigation, and harm our business, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain\nthe Zoom brand, including consumer and public perception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive\nexpenses in this effort, our business will be harmed.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our headcount has grown from 2,532 full-\ntime employees as of January 31, 2020, to 4,422 full-time employees as of January 31, 2021, with employees located\nboth in the United States and internationally. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous,\nsignificant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to\nsupport our user base, our expanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our\ninternal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to\ngrow, we face challenges integrating, developing, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various\ncountries around the world. For example, a significant number of our employees were hired in recent months and have\nnever been to one of our office locations. Certain members of our management have not previously worked together\nfor an extended period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a public company, which may affect\nhow they manage our growth. Managing our growth will also require significant expenditures and allocation of\nvaluable management resources.\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for\nand model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties\nfrequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary\nlevel of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth,\nour business would be harmed.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur business may be significantly affected by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer\nor business spending.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand any resulting effect on spending by our customers. While some of our customers may consider our platform to be\na cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform as\na discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their discretionary spending on our platform during an\neconomic downturn. Given current economic conditions, we could experience a reduction in demand and loss of\ncustomers, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact on various\nindustries that our unified communications platform addresses. We would lose customers as a result of customers\nceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty\nin collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. While we have seen increased usage stemming from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free Basic\naccounts, which do not generate any revenue. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will experience an increase in\npaid hosts once the pandemic tapers, particularly in light of the economic downturn. Similarly, given the shift in\nour customer base from largely businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that we will see higher rates of non-renewals than we have experienced\nhistorically.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, EMEA and\nAPAC. All of our executive officers are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key person life insurance\npolicies. Any changes in our senior management team in particular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be\ndisruptive to our business. While we seek to prepare for such transitions, including by establishing strong\nprocesses and procedures and succession planning, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and\ncause disruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively or execute our\nplans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover or otherwise, our business could be\nharmed.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in April 2019 and\npotential candidates may not perceive our compensation package, including our equity awards, as favorably as\nemployees hired prior to our IPO. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be\naltered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes\nin a timely manner. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. We must also continue to retain and motivate existing employees through our compensation\npractices, company culture, and career development opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain\nour current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\nIn addition, following our IPO, many of our employees are now able to receive significant proceeds from sales of\nour equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, this\nliquidity could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 31%, 19%, and 18% of our total revenue for the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in further\nselect international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with global users, and we\nexpect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions\nand providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any\nnew markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our\nplatform may not be receptive. For example, if we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-specific\nrequirements, we may experience service outages or other adverse consequences which would impair our ability to\nexpand further into certain markets. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations\ninternationally in the future may require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international\nexpansion will require investment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex\nemployment- and compensation-related laws, regulations and practices in these international jurisdictions, and\nmaintaining our company culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to\nemployees in certain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations.\nThis may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash\ncompensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees\nin these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\n22\nTable of Contents\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection and\nunsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our\npractices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as does the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as does the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United\nStates, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual\nproperty outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”\") withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade\nprotection measures, import or export requirements, trade embargoes, and other trade barriers;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a\ntimely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and\nregulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease\noperations in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, while our engineering team is headquartered in the\nUnited States, we employ a product development team that has a relatively significant footprint in China today,\nwhere personnel costs are less expensive than in many other geographies. This product development team carries out\nthe design and architecture decisions made by our U.S. engineering team. We recently announced our intent to expand\nour research and development presence in Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as in Singapore and\nIndia. As a result of this expansion, we could experience, among other things, difficulty in attracting and\nretaining talent in these location and higher operating expenses, which would adversely impact our operating\nmargins and harm our business.\nAt the same time, our operations in China have caused and may in the future cause us to be subject to regulatory\nscrutiny both in China and in the United States. For example, in September 2019, the Chinese government turned off\nour service in China without warning and requested that we take certain steps prior to restoring our service,\nincluding designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests and transferring China-based user data\nhoused in the United States to a data center in China. Also, in June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the\nDepartment of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of\nJustice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of\n23\nTable of Contents\nCalifornia (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our interactions\nwith foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as about\nstorage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY subpoena\nrequested information about the actions we took relating to the Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. The NDCA subpoena\nalso requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We are fully\ncooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation.\nThese investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately\ndiscover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict\nthe outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur\nsubstantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan\nmust be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers\nand hosts and, consequently, our business.\nWe have designed our platform to be easy to adopt and use with minimal to no support necessary. However, if we\nexperience increased user demand for support, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations.\nSurging demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to allocate additional resources to support our\nexpanded user base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time. In addition,\nas we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide\nefficient support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. Customers and hosts receive\nadditional support features, and the number of our hosts has grown significantly, which will put additional\npressure on our support organization. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we\nneed to hire additional support personnel, including as a result of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour business may be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and\non positive recommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our\nbusiness.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor\ntheir products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant\ntime and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to\nscale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and\ntraining. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to\neffectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop\nrelationships with new\n24\nTable of Contents\nresellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to manage, train, or\nprovide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of new customers and\nhosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our business.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nsmall amount is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of\nthe jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,\n20.2%, 9.4%, and 6.4% of our revenue, respectively, and 11.9%, 17.5%, and 12.3% of our expenses, respectively, were\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations\nin currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could\nmaterially impact our results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.\nWe expect to increase our sales to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency customers. For example,\nwe announced in May 2019 that we received authorization under the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) that allows U.S. federal government agencies and contractors to securely use our Zoom for\nGovernment offering. The additional risks and challenges associated with doing business with governmental entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will\ngenerate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government\nsector until we have attained such certificates;\ngovernmental entities may have significant leverage in negotiations, thereby enabling such entities to demand\ncontract terms that differ from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements, including, for example,\nmost-favored-nation clauses; and\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced by public sector budgetary cycles and funding\nauthorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector demand for our\nproducts.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities in the future, our exposure to such\nrisks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our business.\nOur current products, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase\nour base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially\nsuffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products\nto new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our products, or\nthe introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current products, as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate\ncarriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that\nwill use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our\nmargins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products. In\n25\nTable of Contents\naddition, new products that we introduce in the future may similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties, all of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If this trend continues with our\nnew and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid host base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWhile to date we have not incurred significant income taxes in operating our business, we are subject to income\ntaxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could\nfluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax\nrates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses; changes in excess tax benefits\nof stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use, deferred tax assets; the\napplicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples; changes in U.S. federal, state, or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such\nas the recent legislation enacted in the United States, other fundamental changes in law currently being considered\nby many countries; and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and\npositions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax\nauthorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take, and if any such tax authority were to\nsuccessfully challenge any such position, our business could be harmed.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in federal, state, or international tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed of enacted Digital Services Taxes (\"DST\"), many of which would apply to revenues derived from digital\nservices. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of the OECD's\nInclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing\nour future tax obligations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had $1,264.3 million of U.S. federal and $797.0 million of state net operating loss\ncarryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2032 for federal and 2027\nfor state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating\nloss carryforwards before their expiration or at all. Under legislative changes made in December 2017, as modified\nby the federal tax law changes enacted in March 2020, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2020, the deductibility of such net operating losses is limited. In addition, the\nfederal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be\n26\nTable of Contents\nsubject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the “Code”), respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, if a\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or\ntax may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership\nby “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may\napply under state tax laws. We have completed a Section 382 review and have determined that none of the operating\nlosses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s). However, we may experience ownership changes in the\nfuture as a result of future shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an\nownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits is materially\nlimited, it would harm our business by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nIn addition, for state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is\nsuspended or otherwise limited, including a recent California franchise tax law change limiting the usability of\nCalifornia state net operating losses to offset California taxable income in taxable years beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2020 and before January 1, 2023, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets for the U.S. and U.K. as of both January\n31, 2021 and January 31, 2020. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax\nassets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. In\nour valuation allowance evaluation, we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified than to\nevidence that cannot be objectively verified. Our consideration of the evidence requires management to make a\nnumber of significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters.\nGiven our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that\nin the foreseeable future, sufficient positive evidence may become available that results in a conclusion that a\nportion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the\nrecognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is\nrecorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the\nbasis of the level of profitability (pretax income adjusted for permanent differences) that we are able to actually\nachieve.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies.\nFor example, we announced our acquisition of Keybase Inc in May 2020. We have limited experience in acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on\nfavorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive\nposition or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, developers, or\ninvestors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or effectively manage the\ncombined company following an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or\ntechnologies associated with those acquisitions, into our company, the results of operations of the combined\ncompany could be adversely affected. Any integration process will require significant time and resources, require\nsignificant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able\nto manage the process successfully, which could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or\nutilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction,\nincluding accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nBeginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our video-first unified\ncommunications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our\nbusiness, and we have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to\nforecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our\nability to plan for and model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered\nindicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue\ncould decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;\ncontraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for\ncapacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic\nhas also made it difficult to forecast revenue, costs, and expenses, as our platform has recently faced\n27\nTable of Contents\nunprecedented usage from free users and new and existing customers, requiring us to devote significant resources to\nbolster our capacity and infrastructure. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently\nexperienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described\nherein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are\nincorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nprivacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual\nobligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.\nWe receive, store, process, generate, use, and share personal information and other customer and user content\nnecessary to provide our service and ensure it is delivered effectively, to operate our business, for legal and\nmarketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. There are numerous federal, state, local, and\ninternational laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the collection,\nstoring, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content,\nthe scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among\ncountries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual\nobligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. We strive to comply\nwith applicable laws, certifications, documentation, publications, regulations, standards, policies and other\nobligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security to the extent possible. Although we\nendeavor to comply with applicable laws and our policies, publications, certifications, and documentation, and\nother obligations, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our\nefforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, vendors or business partners do not\ncomply with our policies, certifications, and documentation. Such actual or perceived failures in certain cases\nhave subjected, and can subject, us to potential international, local, state and federal legal or regulatory\naction, including in the event that our policies, certifications, and documentation are found or alleged to be\ninaccurate, incomplete, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. The regulatory framework\nfor privacy and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain, uncertain for the foreseeable future, which\nwe expect will increase our compliance costs and exposure to liability, and it is possible that these or other\nactual or alleged obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction\nto another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our\nservices, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic could make it more\ndifficult for us to comply with our contractual obligations, our policies, our publications, our certifications,\nour documentation, standards, regulations, and applicable laws related to privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity, and has and could result in greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our\nprivacy, data protection, and information security practices. Any compliance failure, as well as greater public\nscrutiny of our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, could result in increased\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nFor example, in June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office\nfor EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign political\nparties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user data, the\ndevelopment and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the Tiananmen\ncommemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office\nfor the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various security, data\nprotection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as\ncalculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information\nrelating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or\nsuccessful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate\nto users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related\ninformation. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough\ninternal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which\nfacts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not\ntake. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters\ncould cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational\nharm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, industry standards, guidance and\ncontractual obligations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in\nvarious jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect\nin the EU. The GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and requires us and our customers to give\nmore detailed disclosures\n28\nTable of Contents\nabout how we collect, use and share personal information; contractually commit to data protection measures in our\ncontracts with clients; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of\ncertain data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals’\ndata protection rights, including their rights to access, correct and delete their personal information. The GDPR\nprovides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR\ncan face private litigation, restrictions on data processing, and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or\n4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers’, partners’, or vendors’ failure to comply with the GDPR\ncould lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or restrictions on our ability to process personal\ninformation as needed to provide our product and services. We may also be obligated to assist our customers,\npartners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the GDPR, which could require expenditure of\nsignificant resources. Assisting our customers, partners, and vendors in complying with the GDPR, or complying with\nthe GDPR ourselves, may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business\npractices.\nFurther, the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty in data\nprotection issues involving the U.K. For example, pursuant to a post-Brexit trade deal between the U.K. and the EU,\ntransfers of personal information from the European Economic Area to the U.K. are not considered restricted\ntransfers under the GDPR for a period of up to six months from January 1, 2021. However, unless the EU Commission\nmakes an adequacy finding with respect to the U.K. before the end of that period, the U.K. will be considered a\n“third country” under the GDPR and transfers of European personal information to the U.K. will require an adequacy\nmechanism to render such transfers lawful under the GDPR. Additionally, although the U.K. enacted a Data Protection\nAct in May 2018 that is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers\nto and from the U.K. will be regulated notwithstanding Brexit. The effects of Brexit have been and are expected to\ncontinue to be far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and\neconomic conditions globally, and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit\ncould also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K. and the\nEU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as\nthe U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will remain\nso until the U.K. and EU reach a definitive resolution with regards to outstanding trade and legal matters. Given\nthese possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent\nto which our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is\nuncertain.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal information from\nEurope, including the European Economic Area, U.K. and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries\nunless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal\ninformation. One of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe has\nbeen certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce. However, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision\ninvalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. The same decision also raised questions about whether one of the\nprimary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses,\ncan lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries.\nSimilarly, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner announced that the\nSwiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is inadequate for personal information transfers from Switzerland to the United\nStates, and also raised questions about the viability of the Standard Contractual Clauses. At present, there are\nfew, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, and the Standard\nContractual Clauses, all of which are mechanisms on which we have relied for personal information transfers from\nEurope to the United States and other countries. Authorities in the U.K. may similarly invalidate use of the\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield and raise questions on the viability of the Standard Contractual Clauses, as mechanisms for\nlawful personal information transfers to the United States and other countries. In November 2020, EU regulators\nproposed a new set of Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). The new SCCs impose additional obligations and\nrequirements with respect to the transfer of EU personal data to other jurisdictions, which may increase the legal\nrisks and liabilities under the GDPR and local EU laws associated with cross-border data transfers, and result in\nmaterial increased compliance and operational costs. If we are unable to implement a valid solution for personal\ninformation transfers from Europe, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and\ninjunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe, and we may be required to increase\nour data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. Inability to import personal information from\nEurope to the United States or other countries may decrease demand for our products and services as our customers\nthat are subject to the GDPR may seek alternatives that do not involve personal information transfers out of\nEurope. Our inability to import personal information to the United States and other countries may decrease the\nfunctionality or effectiveness of our products and services and adversely impact our marketing efforts, plans and\nactivities. We expect EU regulators to aggressively enforce EU laws prohibiting data transfers to the U.S. and\nother countries without a legally sound transfer mechanism, and it possible that EU regulators could prevent Zoom\nfrom transferring any personal data out of the EU to certain countries like the U.S.\nAdditionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data\ntransfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency and restricting cross-border data transfer, which\ncould increase the\n29\nTable of Contents\ncost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. For example, Brazil recently enacted the\nGeneral Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), which broadly\nregulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance obligations and penalties comparable to\nthose of the GDPR.\nStates have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. For example, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy\nprotections. The CCPA gives California residents, among other things, expanded rights to access and require\ndeletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed\ninformation about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for\nviolations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The\nCCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”),\nwhich was approved by California voters in November 2020, becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other\nthings, give consumers the ability to limit use of information deemed to be sensitive, increase the maximum\npenalties for violations concerning consumers under age 16, establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to\nimplement and enforce the new law, and impose administrative fines. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA, and their\ninterpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in\nan effort to comply.\nThe CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, as\nother states may follow California’s lead and increase protections for their residents. The CCPA has already\nprompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our\npotential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective\nOctober 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among\nother things, that businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from\nconsumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Virginia has similarly enacted a comprehensive privacy\nlaw, the Consumer Data Protection Act, which emulates the CCPA and CPRA in many respects and takes effect on\nJanuary 1, 2023.\nThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a U.S. Federal law that applies to operators of\ncommercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal\ninformation from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are\ncollecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications services to\nschools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid classrooms, distance\nlearning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these services, Zoom may be used\nby students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information from such students on\nbehalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s information practices on\nbehalf of students, prior to students using the services. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain processing of the\npersonal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on the country) without parental consent. The\nCCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California under 16 (or parental consent for children\nunder 13) before selling their personal information. COPPA is subject to interpretation by courts and other\ngovernmental authorities, including the FTC, and the FTC is authorized to promulgate, and has promulgated,\nrevisions to regulations implementing provisions of COPPA. Although we strive to ensure that our platform and\napplications are compliant with applicable provisions of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, these provisions may be\nmodified, interpreted, or applied in new manners that we may be unable to anticipate or prepare for appropriately,\nand we may incur substantial costs or expenses in attempting to modify our systems, platform, applications, or\nother technology to address changes in COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, or interpretations thereof. If we fail to\naccurately anticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, we\ncould be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions, litigation, fines and\npenalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such failures, we could be in\nbreach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us, which could harm our\nreputation and business.\nWith laws and regulations, such as the GDPR in the EU as well as the CCPA, SPI Law, HIPAA, and COPPA in the United\nStates imposing relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and\napplication of these and other laws and regulations, we have faced and may face additional challenges in addressing\ntheir requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and\nexpenses in an effort to do so, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAdditional uses of our services arising out of increased demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require\nus to address additional privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies,\nand contractual obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, regulations,\nstandards, policies, and contractual obligations, or our privacy policies, publications, certifications, or\ndocumentation have led and could lead to governmental investigations or enforcement actions (including\ninvestigations or actions by state attorneys general, federal regulators, and international regulators), litigation\n(including class action litigation), claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others,\nand could result in significant liability, fines or penalties, or cause our users to lose trust in us, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nWe also have been the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations\nand practices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January\n19, 2021. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information. We could fail or be perceived to fail\nto comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other orders or settlements relating to litigation\nor governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and security practices. Any failure or perceived failure\nto comply with such orders or settlements may increase the possibility of additional adverse consequences,\nincluding litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions, or monetary penalties, or require further changes\nto our business practices, significant management time, or the diversion of significant operational resources.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other\nobligations that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the\noverall demand for, our platform and services, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and\nfeatures, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and\nprocess user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,\ndisclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and\ncustomers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their\nown IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with\ncontrol over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by\nmalicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our\nproducts directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened\ntougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The direct and indirect effects of\ntariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China\neconomic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of\ngovernmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions\nand further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China,\ncould result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade\nrestrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken\nby the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or\nother countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries\nin retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between the United States and China could exacerbate\nthese actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law\nin Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with\nthe business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy\nor operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and\ncertain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or react to these changes.\n31\nTable of Contents\nFurther, in May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic\npowers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in\ntransactions that imposed undue national security risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the\nSecretary of Commerce and applies to contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. In addition,\nthe U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement further restrictions that\nwould affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing,\ncontent, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will successfully mitigate any\nnegative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the executive order and its\nimplementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of\nincreased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our\nsubscription services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nWe collect sales tax in a number of jurisdictions. One or more states or countries may seek to impose incremental\nor new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us. A successful assertion by a state, country, or other\njurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes could, among\nother things, result in substantial tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage\npotential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental cost of any such sales or other related\ntaxes, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, any additional\ntaxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical\npresence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales of\nour platform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. However, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient\nphysical presence or nexus for a state or local jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made\nover the internet, and there is also uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our platform as not taxable\nin certain jurisdictions will be accepted by state and local taxing authorities.\nTaxing authorities may challenge our position that we do not have sufficient nexus in a taxing jurisdiction or that\nour platform is not taxable in the jurisdiction which could result in increased tax liabilities for us or our\ncustomers and hosts, which could harm our business.\nThe application of indirect taxes (such as sales tax, use tax, telecommunications tax, VAT, GST, and gross receipts\ntax) to businesses that transact online, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. Following the recent U.S.\nSupreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. , states are now free to levy taxes on sales of goods and\nservices based on an “economic nexus,” regardless of whether the seller has a physical presence in the state. As a\nresult, it may be necessary to reevaluate whether our activities give rise to sales, use, and other indirect taxes\nas a result of any nexus in those jurisdictions in which we are not currently registered to collect and remit\ntaxes. Additionally, we may need to assess our potential tax collection and remittance liabilities based on\nexisting economic nexus laws’ dollar and transaction thresholds. We continue to analyze our exposure for such taxes\nand liabilities and have accrued $58.1 million and $34.0 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for\nloss contingencies resulting from these potential taxes and liabilities. The application of existing, new, or\nfuture laws, whether in the United States or internationally, could harm our business. There have been, and will\ncontinue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in\nthe numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in apparent violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently made\nour software products available to some customers, including users in embargoed or sanctioned countries, in\napparent violation of the EAR. As a result, we submitted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures concerning\npotential violations of U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”).\nIn June 2019, OFAC and BIS issued us warning letters as their final enforcement responses to these potential\nviolations, but no fines or penalties were assessed. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions\nor export control laws in the future, it could result in fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected\nthrough other penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working\nto implement additional controls designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls\nmay not be fully effective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that\ncould result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,\nchanges in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with\nthe laws.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the\nhost or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful\nbehavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety\nteam may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or\nreferral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as\na result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely\nbetween jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to\nlegal actions along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may\nface, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the\ncontent shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nOur platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has\nbeen blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,\nor fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we\ncould be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, amended, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-\nkickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees and\nintermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to government officials and\nother recipients for improper purposes. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, our\nexposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to expand our international presence, and any failure to\ncomply with such laws could harm our business.\n33\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In\naddition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nChanges in FCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations\non our other services. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that three issues remanded by the\nU.S. Court of Appeals following the appeal of its 2018 decision to eliminate its network neutrality rules did not\nprovide a basis to alter its conclusions in that order. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending.\nDemocratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the\nlikelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. Such\naction could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the\nones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to\nmodify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation\ncould result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many\nMembers of Congress from both parties support reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional\naction remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to adopt rules\ninterpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that is\ntransmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a vote\non that proposal and the FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The\nDemocratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of\nthe FCC. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or the FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same\nlevel of protection offered by Section 230. This would increase the risks faced by internet-based businesses, like\nZoom, that rely on third-party content. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer. We generally pass USF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our\ncustomers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in our products becoming more expensive. We expect that\nstate public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to\nservices like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our\nbusiness, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings,\nexit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every\nsignificant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an\nimportant factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately\nprotect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in\nthose trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may\nknowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third parties may challenge our proprietary right;\npending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to\nprevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the\ndevelopment of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies\nand processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants,\nand third parties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others\nmay independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or\ndevelop similar technologies and processes. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same\nlevel of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks,\ntrade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain\ncountries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending\nour intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of\ntheft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including\ntechnical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our\nintellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial\nadvantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary\nto enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is\ninadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible\nassets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features.\nAny of these events would harm our business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our\nlicensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open\nsource software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in the usage of our unified communications platform,\nand as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly increased, while at the same time,\nthe broader market has experienced significant declines and volatility. There are no assurances that the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock will continue at this level for any period of time. Moreover, the trading price\nof our Class A common stock could experience a significant decrease once the scope and impact of the COVID-19\npandemic is better understood. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our\nClass A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock\ninclude the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n36\nTable of Contents\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April and June 2020, we and certain of our officers and directors were sued in putative\nclass action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities\nlaws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our data privacy and security measures.\nWe may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future. Securities litigation against us could\nresult in substantial costs and divert our management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which\ncould harm our business. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nSecurities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention\nand resources.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of March 9,\n2021, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 71.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding 61.6% of\nsuch voting power in the aggregate. As of March 9, 2021, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric\nS. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 8.4% of our outstanding capital stock but controlled\napproximately 30.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have significant\ninfluence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election\nof directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or our assets, for the\nforeseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one share of Class A\ncommon stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or incapacity of Mr. Yuan,\n(ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his\nemployment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding\nshares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our\nIPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly\npublic companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected\nindices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the\nS&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for\ninclusion in any of these indices,\n37\nTable of Contents\nand as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track\nthese indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are new, and it is as of yet unclear what effect,\nif any, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible\nthat they may depress these valuations or depress our trading volume compared to those of other similar companies\nthat are included.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could\n38\nTable of Contents\nlimit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock and\ncould also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using legacy communication\nmethods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product feature that every\ncustomer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform does not provide. The\nvariables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no\nguarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates\nwill purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the markets in which\nwe compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons\noutside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm\nour business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted virtually every\ncountry in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an\nadverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service\ndisruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to\nsupport our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. We have removed the 40-minute time\nlimit from our free Basic accounts for customers in K-12 schools in certain countries. While we have seen increased\nusage of our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which\ndo not generate any revenue. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or\nthat new or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels after the COVID-19 pandemic has\ntapered. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has required and will\ncontinue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of\nequity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to\nthe rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have\n40\nTable of Contents\nexpended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs\nand significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The\nNasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\n41\nTable of Contents"

Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held in street name by brokers and\nother nominees on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our\nClass A common stock represented by these holders of record.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash\ndividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on\na number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual\nrestrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC, for purposes of\nSection 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed\nto be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act.\nThe following graph compares (i) the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A common stock from April 18,\n2019 (the date our Class A common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market) through January 31,\n2021 with (ii) the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index (“RUT”) and the Nasdaq Computer Index (“IXCO”)\nover the same period, assuming the investment of $100 in our Class A common stock and in both of the other indices\non April 18, 2019 and the reinvestment of dividends. The graph uses the closing market price on April 18, 2019 of\n$62.00 per share as the initial value of our Class A common stock.

                "content": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nWe provide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how\npeople interact. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, voice, chat, and content sharing and\nenable face-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and\nlocations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video that is easy to use, manage, and deploy;\nprovides an attractive return on investment; is scalable; and easily integrates with applications and physical\nspaces. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust.\nWe strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that “just\nworks” while prioritizing their privacy and security. Our goal is to make Zoom Meetings better than in-person\nmeetings. Our 21 co-located data centers located worldwide and the public cloud enable us to provide both high-\nquality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth environments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications platform. Subscription revenue is\ndriven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products, including Zoom Rooms,\nZoom Video Webinars, Zoom Phone, and Hardware-as-a-Service (“HaaS”) for rooms and phones. A host is any user of our\nunified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join that\nmeeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We define a customer as a\nseparate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size (including a\ndistinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Basic offering is free and gives hosts access\nto Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that meetings with more than two endpoints time-out at\n40 minutes. Our paid offerings include our Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education, and Healthcare plans, which\nprovide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant limits, administrative controls, and\nreporting.\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in three specific markets (United States/Canada, United\nKingdom/Ireland, and Australia/New Zealand). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in over 40 countries and territories where\nZoom has local PSTN coverage. In addition, the Zoom United plan launched in December 2020 provides a single license\nfor customers to purchase Zoom Phone, Meetings and chat capabilities as a bundled offering.\nOur revenue was $2,651.4 million, $622.7 million, and $330.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021,\n2020, and 2019, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rate of 326% and 88% for fiscal year 2021 and\nfiscal year 2020,\n45\nTable of Contents\nrespectively. We had net income of $672.3 million, $25.3 million, and $7.6 million for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,471.2 million,\n$151.9 million, and $51.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of the COVID-19 disease was first identified and began to spread across the globe. In\nMarch 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, impacting many countries around the world.\nGovernments have instituted lockdown or other similar measures to slow infection rates. Many organizations have\nresorted to mandating employees to work from home, which has resulted in these organizations seeking out video\ncommunication solutions like ours to keep employees as productive as possible, even while working from home.\nSchools, colleges, and universities globally have also closed as a result of this pandemic. Many of these\ninstitutions are utilizing our platform to provide remote instruction to their students. To help teachers and\nstudents navigate this unprecedented situation, we have temporarily removed the 40-minute time limit for meetings\nwith more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 domains worldwide.\nWhile we have experienced a significant increase in paid hosts and revenue due to the pandemic, the aforementioned\nfactors have also driven increased usage of our services and have required us to expand our network, data storage,\nand processing capacity, both in our own co-located data centers as well as through third-party cloud hosting,\nwhich has resulted, and is continuing to result, in an increase in our operating costs. Furthermore, a significant\nportion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free Basic accounts and our removal of the time\nlimit for school domains, which do not generate any revenue, but still require us to incur these additional\noperating costs to expand our capacity. Therefore, the recent increase in usage of our platform has adversely\nimpacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our gross margin.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or that new or existing users\nwill continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has tapered. Moreover, the tapering of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, particularly as vaccinations become widely available, may result in a decline in paid hosts and\nusers once individuals are no longer working or attending school from home.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or\nthe future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and\nmarketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who\nare able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger enterprise customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or\ngeography, before rolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have\ndeployed our platform globally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in\nthe use of our platform also provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our\ncustomers, such as Zoom Phone, Zoom HaaS, Zoom for Home, Zoom Rooms at each office location, and Zoom Video\nWebinars. In order for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing\ncustomers, we will need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that\nare responsive to our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion\nrate includes the increase in user adoption within our customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven\nby the number of paid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our\nsubscription revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion\nrate as of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all customers with more than 10\nemployees as of 12 months prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of\nsubscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring\nrevenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription\nagreements from all customers for the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers\n46\nTable of Contents\nwho have not provided any indication that they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from\nthese customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and\nattrition. We divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For\nthe trailing 12-months calculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12\nmonths. Our net dollar expansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of\npenetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers.\nOur trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate in customers with more than 10 employees was greater than 130% as\nof January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, and Zoom Video\nWebinars. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of Zoom for Home, a solution designed for\nthe home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible hardware. We also expanded our geographic\nfootprint with Zoom Phone availability in 26 new countries and territories during fiscal year 2021, bringing the\ntotal to 44. Third-party developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it\neasier for customers and developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as\nmore developers and other third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will\nbecome the ubiquitous platform for communications. We will need to expend additional resources to continue\nintroducing new products, features, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the\nvalue of our platform with their own applications.\nAn End-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is now available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host\nmeetings with up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings\nby default, but with Zoom’s new E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography\nto distribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nWe recently announced two additions to the Zoom platform: OnZoom and Zoom Apps. OnZoom is an online event platform\nfor Zoom users to create and host free, paid, and fundraising events. OnZoom is currently offered as a public beta\nfor U.S. users to attend online events. Zoom Apps are a new app type coming soon to the Zoom App Marketplace. These\nin-product integrations will be accessible directly from Zoom Meetings and the Zoom Desktop client and are designed\nto facilitate collaboration and engagement during meetings.\nInternational Expansion\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 31%, 19%, and 18% of our total revenue\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in\nfurther select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in certain\ninternational markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for our\nplatform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nCustomers with More Than 10 Employees\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our\ncustomer base, which includes organizations of all sizes across industries. We define a customer as a separate and\ndistinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size (including a distinct unit\nof an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. To better distinguish business customers from our broader\ncustomer base, we review the number of customers with more than 10 employees. As of January 31, 2021, 2020, and\n2019, we had approximately 467,100, 81,900, and 50,800 customers, respectively, with more than 10 employees. When\ndisclosing the number of customers, we round down to the nearest hundred.\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic early this fiscal year, our customer cohort with 10 or fewer employees\nexpanded as business owners and individual users adopted Zoom for many personal, professional, and social events.\nAs a result, we have experienced a shift in the makeup of customer cohorts, with 36% of revenue attributable to\ncustomers with 10 or fewer employees during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to 18% for the prior\nfiscal year.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as a\nmeasure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from these\ncustomers represented 20%, 33%, and 30% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and\n2019, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had 1,644, 641, and 344 customers, respectively,\nthat contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger\norganizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of the customers with more than 10 employees.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”), a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metric, may calculate this metric differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP metric as\na comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021           2020          2019\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating           $               1,471,177    $   151,892    $   51,332\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                            -79,972        -38,084       -28,432\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                $               1,391,205    $   113,808    $   22,900\nNet cash used in investing activities    $              -1,562,420    $  -499,468    $  -39,719\nNet cash provided by financing           $               2,050,277    $   615,690    $   17,534\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications\nplatform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also provide\nservices, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are generally\nconsidered distinct from the access to our unified communications platform.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, third-\nparty cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized\nsoftware development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost\nof revenue to increase in absolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year, as we expand our data center capacity\ndue to increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue\nmay decrease over time as we scale our data centers to accommodate usage from our increased customer base and as\nthe ratio of free to paid users varies.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research\nand development for the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing research and development headcount, as we focus\non further developing our platform, enhancing its use cases, and strengthening security and privacy. As a result,\nwe expect our research and development expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total\nrevenue, during the upcoming fiscal year.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of deferred contract\nacquisition costs and credit card processing fees related to sales. We plan to increase our investment in sales and\nmarketing over the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing the headcount of our direct sales force and\nmarketing investments in demand generation. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase\nboth in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue, during the upcoming fiscal year.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance,\nlegal, and human resources organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting\nservices; expected credit losses; insurance; indirect taxes; and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the size\nof our general and administrative function to support the growth and complexity of our business. As a result, we\nexpect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively constant\nas a percentage of total revenue, during the upcoming fiscal year.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion earned on our marketable\nsecurities, effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestment.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions\nwhere we conduct business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such

D ue to the COVID-19 pandemic, t here was an increase in usage of our services, as\nmany organizations around the world started utilizing our platform to continue their operations remotely. As a\nresult, the increase in revenue was primarily due to subscription services provided to new customers, which\naccounted for approximately 73% of the increase, and to subscription services provided to existing customers, which\naccounted for approximately 27% of the increase.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021             2020           $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nCost of revenue    $                            821,989       $  115,396       $    706,593         612  %\nGross profit                                  1,829,379          507,262          1,322,117         261  %\nGross margin                                         69  %            81  %\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased by $706.6 million, or 612%, compared to the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily removed the 40-minute\ntime limit for meetings with more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 school\ndomains worldwide . We also experienced a significant increase in usage from paid users as more companies started\nutilizing our platform to allow their employees to work remotely. This increase in usage resulted in an increase of\n$619.2 million in costs related to third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, and our co-\nlocated data centers to support the increase in customers and expanded use of our unified communications platform\nby existing customers. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of $59.3 million in personnel-\nrelated expenses mainly driven by additional headcount, which includes a $27.1 million increase in stock-based\ncompensation expense; an increase of $18.4 million in professional services mainly for customer support, and an\nincrease of $5.8 million related to subscription to software-based services.\nGross margin decreased to 69% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 from 81% for the fiscal year ended January\n31, 2020. The decrease in gross margin was due to higher incremental cost from leveraging third-party cloud hosting\nproviders to meet the significant increase in usage as well as the higher percentage of usage from free users.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021         2020       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nResearch and development    $                            164,080    $  67,079    $    97,001         145  %\nResearch and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased by $97.0 million, or 145%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.

The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of $68.4 million in credit card processing fees as\na result of increased online payments, an increase of $16.0 million in professional services primarily to support\nthe increase in sales, and an increase of $6.2 million related to subscription to software-based services,\npartially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million in marketing and sales event-related costs mainly due to a decrease\nin digital and awareness programs and trade shows.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021         2020       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nGeneral and administrative    $                            320,547    $  86,841    $   233,706         269  %\nGeneral and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased by $233.7 million, or 269%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.

Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be\nsufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription\nrenewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and\nresearch and development efforts, as well as expenses associated with our international expansion, and the timing\nand extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces as well as data center\ninfrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,\nservices, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or\ndebt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to\nraise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021           2020          2019\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating           $               1,471,177    $   151,892    $   51,332\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $              -1,562,420    $  -499,468    $  -39,719\nNet cash provided by financing           $               2,050,277    $   615,690    $   17,534\nactivities\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscriptions to our platform. Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,471.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared\nto $151.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an\nincrease in net income of $647.0 million, the positive impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities of\n$332.1 million, and an increase in non-cash adjustments of $340.2 million, which is primarily a result of higher\nstock-based compensation expense, higher deferred contract acquisition cost amortization due to an increase in\ncapitalized commissions as we continue to grow and expand our customer base, higher provision for accounts\nreceivable allowances due to higher accounts receivable balances, and expenses related to a charitable donation of\ncommon stock in the current fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,562.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $1,438.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $80.0\nmillion, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $26.5 million, purchase of an equity investment of\n$8.0 million, purchases of intangible assets of $5.8 million, and purchase of a convertible note of $5.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $499.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $456.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $38.1\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2,050.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was due to\nproceeds from our follow-on offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, of\n$1,979.2\n53\nTable of Contents\nmillion, proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $38.4\nmillion, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $28.6 million, and proceeds from international employee\nstock sales to be remitted to employees and tax authorities of $4.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $615.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was due to\nproceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO and private placement, net of\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, of $542.5 million, proceeds from international\nemployee stock sales to be remitted to employees and tax authorities of $48.5 million, proceeds from issuance of\ncommon stock pursuant to our ESPP of $15.5 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of\nrepurchases, of $9.2 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $         121,980    $                 19,949    $   41,623    $  35,600    $     24,808\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         498,626                     219,217       271,721        7,688               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         620,606    $                239,166    $  313,344    $  43,288    $     24,808\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in\nthe table above. See the “Future minimum lease payments” table in Note 7 and “Non-cancelable Purchase Obligations”\nin Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and estimates that are both the most\nimportant to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective\nor complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates\nwhere the nature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account\nfor highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on\nfinancial condition or operating performance is material.\nThe critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue\nrecognition through the following steps:\n54\nTable of Contents\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications platform, which consists of one or more software-based services. Our customers do not\nhave the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we provide a series of\ndistinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a professional\nmanner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service-level\ncommitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those\ncustomers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form\nof variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications platform and\nrelated services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nContract Balances\nWe receive payments from customers based on a billing schedule as established in our customer contracts. Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the contract may occur before invoicing to the customer resulting in an\nunbilled accounts receivable.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances are recognized during\nthe following 12-month period.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is recognized based on the fair value of the awards\ngranted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nfair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of\nour common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions\nused to determine the fair value of the option awards\n56\nTable of Contents\nrepresent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years. We account for forfeitures as they occur\ninstead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nAs noted above, our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective\nassumptions. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be\nmaterially different for the current period and in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input\nfrom management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation specialists. Stock-based compensation for\nfinancial reporting purposes is measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as when\nadditional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available in a valuation report issued as of a\nsubsequent date. After our IPO, the fair value of common stock for each grant date was determined based on the\nclosing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the respective grant.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be\noutstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to\nestimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the\nexpected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of\nthe time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For stock options granted to non-employees, the\nexpected term equals the contractual term of the option.\nExpected Volatility. As we have a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was\nestimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public\ncompanies in our industry, which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a\nperiod equivalent to the expected term of the awards.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our IPO, the fair value of our business, or enterprise value, was determined\nusing either the market approach or a combination of the market and income approaches. The market approach\nestimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of\nbusiness and secondary transactions of our capital stock. From the comparable companies, a representative market\nvalue multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company’s financial results to estimate the value of\nthe subject company. The market approach also includes consideration of the transaction price of secondary sales of\nour capital stock by investors. The income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present\nvalue of our future estimated cash flows and our residual value beyond the forecast period. These future cash\nflows, including the cash flows beyond the forecast period for the residual value, are discounted to their present\nvalues using an appropriate discount rate, to reflect the risks inherent in us achieving these estimated cash\nflows.\nThe resulting equity value is then allocated to each class of stock using an Option Pricing Model (“OPM”). The OPM\ntreats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based\non the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common stock is modeled as a call option with\na claim on the equity value at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible\npreferred stock is liquidated. The exclusive reliance on the OPM through July 31, 2018 was appropriate when the\nrange of possible future outcomes was difficult to predict and resulted in a highly speculative forecast. Beginning\nin October 2018, we performed the equity allocation using a probability weighted expected return method (“PWERM”).\nThe PWERM involves the estimation of the value of our company under multiple future potential outcomes, and\nestimates the probability of each potential outcome. The per share value of our common stock when determined using\nthe PWERM was ultimately based upon probability-weighted per share values resulting from the various future\nscenarios, which include an IPO, merger or sale, or continued operation as a private company. After the equity\nvalue was determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”)\nwas applied to arrive at the fair value of common stock on a non-marketable basis. A DLOM is applied based on the\ntheory that as an owner of a private company stock, the stockholder has limited information and opportunities to\nsell this stock.\n57\nTable of Contents\nA market participant that would purchase this stock would recognize this risk and thereby require a higher rate of\nreturn, which would reduce the overall fair market value.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO on April 18, 2019, our assessments of the fair value of common stock for grant\ndates were based in part on the current available financial and operational information and the common stock value\nprovided in the most recent valuation as compared to the timing of each grant. For financial reporting purposes, we\nconsidered the amount of time between the valuation date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest\ncommon stock valuation or a straight-line interpolation between the two valuation dates. This determination\nincluded an evaluation of whether the subsequent valuation indicated that any significant change in valuation had\noccurred between the previous valuation and the grant date.\nFor valuation after our IPO, the fair value of common stock for each grant date was determined based on the closing\nprice of our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the respective\ngrant.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan Valuation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense related to our ESPP purchase rights based on the estimated grant\ndate fair value, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the aggregate number of\nshares of our common stock expected to be purchased under each offering. The assumptions used to determine the fair\nvalue of the ESPP purchase rights, including the expected term of the awards, the expected volatility of the price\nof our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, represent\nmanagement’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s\njudgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each\nESPP offering period, which is generally two years. We account for modifications to employee contributions as they\noccur.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. If factors\nchange and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for\nthe current period and in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the awards was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of the ESPP represents the period of time that purchase rights are expected to\nbe outstanding.\nExpected Volatility. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, as we\nhave a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average\nhistoric price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in our industry which are\neither similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term\nof the awards. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, expected\nvolatility was determined using a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock and\nhistorical volatility of our stock price.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a small amount\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in\nwhich we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, China, Europe, and Australia. Our\nresults of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates\napplicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. As the impact of\n58\nTable of Contents\nforeign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into\nderivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more\nsignificant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion and marketable securities of $2.0 billion as of January 31, 2021.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n59\nTable of Contents"

We also have audited the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting\nfor leases as of February 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases .\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions\n61\nTable of Contents\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $2,651\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2021.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts, and recalculated the amount of\nrevenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the arrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying\nperformance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by\nassessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nprovide a video-first unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people\ninteract. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing and enable\nface-to-face video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate devices and locations.\nWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2021.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, the allowance for credit\nlosses, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, stock-based\ncompensation expense, sales and other tax liabilities, the fair value of marketable securities, equity investment,\nconvertible promissory note, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and the valuation of deferred income tax\nassets and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions,\nand the extent of its impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments,\nincluding the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on our customers and our sales cycles. During the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and carried\na higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes\navailable, our estimates may change materially in future periods.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2021 or 2020. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases, corporate credit cards,\nand cash from proceeds from international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses\nand other current assets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $ 50.5million and $ 48.5million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe\n69\nTable of Contents\nemployees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January 31, 2021\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $                 331,547\nLess: Allowance for credit losses                      -20,500\nLess: Allowance for returns                            -16,344\nAccounts receivable, net             $                 294,703\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, our assessment considered business and market disruptions caused by\nCOVID-19 and estimates of credit and collectibility trends. The continued volatility in market conditions and\nevolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict, causing variability and volatility that may have a\nmaterial impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Below is a rollforward of our allowance for\ncredit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of January 31, 2020    $           5,150\nProvision for credit losses                  25,651\nWrite-offs                                  -10,301\nBalance as of January 31, 2021    $          20,500\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a component of stockholders’\nequity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair value were due\nto credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through allowance for credit\nlosses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized gains and losses from\nthe sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and\nlosses are reported in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n70\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications platform during the application\ndevelopment stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform\nthe function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net.\nCosts related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful\nlife, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of\noperations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We have capitalized $\n19.4million, $ 3.1million, and $ 2.5million of software development costs during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nLeases\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and applicable updates as of February 1,\n2019, using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the adoption date. Prior year\ncomparative financial information was not recast under the new standard and continues to be presented under\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840.\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present\nvalue of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as our leases generally do not\nprovide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a\ncollateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, less lease\n71\nTable of Contents\nincentives received. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs\nwithin our control. We currently do not have any finance leases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were no impairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have one reporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2021 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense of developed technology is recorded within cost of\nrevenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of\nour finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the\nremaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not\namortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine\nwhether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine\nthat the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and\namortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. There were no impairment charges to acquired\nintangible assets during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue\nrecognition through the following steps:\n72\nTable of Contents\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications platform, which consists of one or more software-based services. Our customers do not\nhave the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we provide a series of\ndistinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a professional\nmanner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service-level\ncommitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those\ncustomers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form\nof variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications platform and\nrelated services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 2% of total revenue during the periods presented.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located data center costs,\nthird-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of\ncapitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead\ncosts. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related depreciation is allocated to cost\nof revenue and operating expenses based on applicable headcount.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications platform,\ndepreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 34.8million, $\n42.0million, and $ 36.1million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), RSUs, and ESPP) is measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nfair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of\nour common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSA and RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant\ndate.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Foreign currency related gains and\nlosses have been immaterial during the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax\nliability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock,\n74\nTable of Contents\nwhich includes early exercised stock options and RSAs, to be participating securities as holders of such securities\nhave non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common stock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating\ndecision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below.

Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU No. 2019-10, and ASU\nNo. 2019-11 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard. ASU No. 2016-13 and the related updates\nreplace the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model, and requires a financial\nasset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. We adopted the\nstandard as of February 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the\nadoption date. Our adoption did not result in any cumulative effect adjustment in our consolidated financial\nstatements upon adoption as of February 1, 2020.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic\n350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service\nContract . The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting\narrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to\ndevelop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).\nWe adopted ASU No. 2018-15, prospectively, as of February 1, 2020, and our adoption did not have a material impact\non the consolidated financial statements.\n75\nTable of Contents\n2.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances in the consolidated balance sheets was $ 24.6million and $ 12.5million as of January 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 222.0million, $ 119.1million, and $\n50.3million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligation\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n1,750.9million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 883.5million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 867.4million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 70% of\nour remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded\nduring the periods presented.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition costs:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021          2020\n-in thousands\nBeginning balance                       $                  91,130    $   55,516\nAdditions to deferred contract                            307,068        72,715\nacquisition costs\nAmortization of deferred contract                        -104,306       -37,101\nacquisition costs\nEnding balance                          $                 293,892    $   91,130\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,\ncurrent (to be amortized in next 12     $                 136,630    $   44,885\nmonths)\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,                      157,262        46,245\nnoncurrent\nTotal deferred contract acquisition     $                 293,892    $   91,130\ncosts\n3.

We classify our commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills, and certificates of deposit within Level\n2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable in the\nmarket, including readily available pricing sources for the identical underlying security, which may not be\nactively traded. We classify the convertible note as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data\nover fair value inputs, such as the probability weighting of the various scenarios that can impact settlement of\nthe arrangement.\nWe hold a non-marketable equity investment in a private company in the business of designing and developing video\ncommunications hardware. We do not have a controlling financial interest in the investee nor the ability to\nexercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. We have elected to\nmeasure this investment, which does not have a readily determinable fair value, at its cost, minus impairment, if\nany, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a\nsimilar investment of the same issuer (i.e., using the measurement alternative). As of January 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe carrying amount of the equity investment was $ 13.5million and $ 3.0million, respectively. We classify the\nequity investment as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy only if an impairment or observable adjustment is\nrecognized during the period, as it is based on an observable transaction price at the transaction date and other\nunobservable inputs, such as volatility.\n5. Business Combinations\nOn May 7, 2020, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Keybase, Inc. (“Keybase”), a secure\nmessaging and file-sharing company, for purchase consideration of $ 42.9million in cash. The acquisition helps us\nstrengthen the security of our video communications platform by providing end-to-end encryption expertise. The\nacquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 24.3million was attributed to goodwill, $ 3.3million to intangible\nassets, and $ 15.3million to other net assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $\n16.4million. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing products expected to be realized from\nthe acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquired\nintangible assets consisted of developed technology with an estimated useful life of five years. The developed\ntechnology had a remaining useful life of 4.3years as of January 31, 2021, and is amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over its estimated useful life.\nNot included in the purchase consideration, we also entered into holdback agreements with certain employees for $\n20.0million in cash payments, which are subject to such employees’ continued service with us. The holdback amount\nof $ 20.0million will be treated as compensation for research and development over the required service period\nranging from oneto three years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial. The results of operations of Keybase\nhave been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Pro forma and\nhistorical results of operations of Keybase have not been presented, as the results do not have a material effect\non any of the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations.\n79\nTable of Contents\n6.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto 9years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our HaaS offering. As a practical\nexpedient, we account for HaaS with customers as a combined performance obligation with the right to access our\nunified communications platform under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our\nconsolidated financial statements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach\nmaturity, we consider various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist\nto determine whether we are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 14.5million and $ 9.7million , respectively, excluding\nshort-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was immaterial for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 . Rent expense was $ 7.2million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, u\nnder Topic 840.\n81\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\nReported as:                                               2021\nAssets:                                          (in thousands)                    2020\nOperating lease right-of-use assets        $             97,649               $  68,608\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other current         $             15,601               $   7,675\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent                  90,415                  64,792\nTotal operating lease liabilities          $            106,016               $  72,467\nWeighted average remaining lease term                            6.1 years               7.5 years\nWeighted average discount rate                              4.5  %                  5.1  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021         2020\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  13,717    $   9,774\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  39,918    $  34,993\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2021\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2022                                 $                  19,949\n2023                                                    21,313\n2024                                                    20,310\n2025                                                    20,216\n2026                                                    15,384\nThereafter                                              24,808\nTotal operating lease payments       $                 121,980\nLess: imputed interest                                 -15,964\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                 106,016\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of 12 months or longer of $ 498.6million.\nLicense Agreement\nIn May 2020, we entered into a license agreement with MPEGLA to obtain the rights for future use of licensed\nintellectual property in exchange for periodic royalty payments. In connection with the license agreement, we made\nan initial\n82\nTable of Contents\nroyalty payment of $ 9.8million to use the technology until December 31, 2020 and we made an additional payment of\n$ 9.8million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 to use the technology until December 31, 2021. Both payments\nwere amortized in cost of revenue on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statements of operations. For the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we recorded $ 10.6million of such costs. In addition, we made a one-time\npayment of $ 9.8million for past use, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated\nstatements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 85.6million and $ 37.7million, respectively, of which $ 27.5million and $ 3.7million\nare included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 58.1million and $ 34.0million\nare included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based on our best\nestimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of a probable\noutcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue subject to\nsales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant adjustments to the\nsales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for\nchanges to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in the future as\nwe obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nOther Contingencies\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s EAR and various economic and trade sanctions\nregulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). The U.S.\nexport control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of\ncertain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities, and\nalso require authorization for the export of certain encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the\nimport of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements and have\nenacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our hosts’\nability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in apparent violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently made\nour software products available to some customers, including users in embargoed or sanctioned countries, in\napparent violation of the EAR. As a result, we have submitted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures\nconcerning potential violations of U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to the OFAC and the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce’s BIS. In June 2019, OFAC and BIS issued us warning letters as their final enforcement\nresponses to these potential violations, but no fines or penalties were assessed. If we are found to be in\nviolation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result in fines and penalties.\nIn June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York “EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign\n83\nTable of Contents\npolitical parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user\ndata, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the\nTiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and\ninformation relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our\nstatements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition,\nthe NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the\nChinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies,\nprocedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional\nsubpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations\nand have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not\nknow when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or\nwhat actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a\nnegative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other\nfinancial exposure.\nLegal Proceedings\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions have been filed against us in various U.S. federal\ndistrict courts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data\nsharing with third parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). We have also been sued under the DC private attorney\ngeneral statute on behalf of members of the general public. The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state\nconsumer protection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims such as negligence\nand unjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs seek various forms of injunctive and\nmonetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\nfederal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the Northern District of California with our consent;\nlead plaintiffs’ counsel have been appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action\ncomplaint on October 28, 2020. We filed a motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated class action complaint\non December 2, 2020, which is pending ruling by the court, and the parties are presently engaged in discovery, with\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification due on June 25, 2021.\nOn April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our\nofficers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs are purported\nstockholders of the Company. The complaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of\nmaterial fact about our data privacy and security measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest,\nfees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead\nplaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The response to the complaint\nis currently stayed while the court considers a motion for reconsideration regarding its lead plaintiff\nappointment.\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is\nstayed pending resolution of a forthcoming motion to dismiss the securities class action.\nWe believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the\nuncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among\nother things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss that may result from these actions.\nIn September 2019, the FTC issued a CID to us requiring us to produce certain documents and materials and to answer\ncertain interrogatories relating to our privacy and security representations and practices. Since then, we have\nfully cooperated with the investigation. In October 2020, we reached a proposed settlement agreement with the FTC\nstaff, which would resolve the FTC’s allegations that certain of our statements and practices about our security\nconstituted deceptive and unfair acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. On November 10, 2020, the FTC\nCommissioners voted to approve the settlement and, on November 13, 2020, the FTC published the settlement in the\nFederal Register for a 30-day public comment period, which ended on December 13, 2020. On January 19, 2021, the FTC\nvoted to finalize the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement, we neither admit nor deny the FTC’s\nallegations, and the FTC does not impose any fine or penalty upon us. We are required to implement certain\ninjunctive provisions, including, among other things, refraining from making any misrepresentations\n84\nTable of Contents\nregarding the privacy and security of our services or how we collect, maintain, use, delete, disclose, allow access\nto, and protect user information. It also requires us to implement a detailed information security program and\nobtain third-party security assessments periodically.\nWe do not expect the settlement to have a material impact on our financial results. We will cooperate with the\nFTC’s requirements and work to ensure compliance. Any failure to comply with the settlement may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources, all of which could result in a material loss or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n9. Convertible Preferred Stock, Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit), and Equity Incentive Plans\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nUpon completion of the IPO in April 2019, all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding, totaling\n152,665,804shares, were automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock on a\none-to-one basis and their carrying value of $ 159.6million was reclassified into stockholders’ equity. As of\nJanuary 31, 2021 and 2020, there were noshares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nIn connection with the IPO, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which\nauthorized the issuance of 200,000,000shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001with rights\nand preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors.\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into one share of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that is authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nEquity Financing\nOn April 23, 2019, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 9,911,434shares of our Class A common stock at\n$ 36.00per share. On April 18, 2019, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional\n3,130,435shares of our Class A common stock at $ 36.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 447.9million,\nnet of underwriters’ discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO:\nall of the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of\n152,665,804shares of Class B common stock;\n85\nTable of Contents\noutstanding convertible promissory notes and accrued interest automatically converted into 426,223shares of Class\nA common stock based on the IPO price of $ 36.00per share; and\nSalesforce Ventures LLC purchased 2,777,777shares of Class A common stock from us at $ 36.00per share in a\nconcurrent private placement. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 100.0million and did not pay any underwriting\ndiscounts or commissions with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in this private\nplacement.\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees related to our IPO. Prior to the\nIPO, all deferred offering costs were capitalized in other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAfter the IPO, $ 6.4million of deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders’ equity (deficit) as a\nreduction of the IPO proceeds in the consolidated balance sheets. We capitalized $ 2.4million of deferred offering\ncosts within other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, which were\nreclassified into additional paid-in capital upon the completion of the IPO.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 5,882,353shares of our\nClass A common stock, including 735,294shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase\nadditional shares, at $ 340.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 1,980.0million, net of underwriters’\ndiscounts and commissions. The other related offering costs were immaterial.\nCommon Stock\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2021          2020\nStock options outstanding                        9,239,504    16,833,009\nRSUs outstanding                                 4,510,730     1,964,668\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                   724,883     1,323,662\nRemaining shares available for future           44,584,783    33,604,587\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future            9,648,574     7,186,070\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock            68,708,474    60,911,996\nreserved\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock that may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not\nexceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the sum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an\nadditional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of (A) shares that remain available for the\nissuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time our 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B)\nshares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or other stock awards granted under our 2011\nPlan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or expire prior to exercise or settlement; are\nnot issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because of the failure to vest; or are reacquired or\nwithheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or the purchase or exercise price, if any, as such\nshares become available from time to time. In addition, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under our 2019 Plan automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar year, starting on February\n1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock\n(both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase\nor (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors prior to the applicable February 1.\n86\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nStock Options\nOutstanding                    Weighted-\nStock       Weighted-    Average\nOptions         Average    Remaining               Aggregate\n(in thousands, except share,        Exercise    Contractual             Intrinsic\nlife and per share data)           Price    Life (Years)                Value\nBalance as of January 31,                       16,833,009    $       5.73                  7.6    $  1,191,881\n2020\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                       -7,378,477    $       3.87                         $  1,786,657\nCanceled/forfeited/expired                        -215,028    $       8.05\nBalance as of January 31,                        9,239,504    $       7.17                  7.0    $  3,371,457\n2021\nVested and exercisable as\nof January 31,                                   4,641,908    $       3.98                  6.6    $  1,708,663\n2021\nThere were nooptions granted for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.The weighted-average grant date fair value\nof options granted to employees during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 25.17and $ 6.28,\nrespectively. The intrinsic value of the options exercised, which represents the difference between the fair market\nvalue of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option, was $ 1,786.7million, $\n767.3million, and $ 60.8million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of\nJanuary 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options was $\n46.7million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4years.\nThe Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options at the grant dates are as follows:\nYear ended January\n31,                   2020            2019\nExpected term (years)                            5.0-6.1         5.0-6.2\nExpected volatility                              49.9% -53.2%    44.6% -48.2%\nRisk-free interest rate                          1.6% -2.5%      2.6% -3.1%\nExpected dividend yield                          —               —\nThese assumptions and estimates were determined as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input\nfrom management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation specialists. Stock-based compensation for\nfinancial reporting purposes is measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as when\nadditional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available in a valuation report issued as of a\nsubsequent date. After our initial public offering, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock was\nbased on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the grant.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be\noutstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to\nestimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the\nexpected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of\nthe time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock options. For stock options granted to nonemployees, the\nexpected term equals the contractual term of the stock option.\nExpected Volatility. As we have a short trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was\nestimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public\ncompanies in our industry that are similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period\nequivalent to the expected term of the awards.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\n87\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of RSU activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nRSUs\nUnvested                      Weighted-Average\nRSUs       Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nUnvested as of January 31, 2020    1,964,668    $                            79.11\nGranted                            3,351,979    $                           241.32\nVested                              -625,163    $                            86.29\nCanceled/forfeited                  -180,754    $                           181.18\nUnvested as of January 31, 2021    4,510,730    $                           194.57\nAs of January 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested RSUs was $\n734.6million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7years.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 ESPP, which became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, 923,553and\n490,268shares, respectively, of our Class A common stock were purchased under the ESPP.\nAs of January 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $ 31.9million, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.4years.\nWe estimated the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nYear ended January 31,\n2021                      2020\nExpected term (years)      0.5-2.1                   0.5-2.1\nExpected volatility        40.3% -75.0%              40.3% -56.2%\nRisk-free interest rate    0.1% -2.5%                1.5% -2.5%\nExpected dividend yield    —                         —\nShares Reserved for Charitable Donations\nDuring fiscal year 2020, our board of directors approved the issuance of 500,000shares of Class A common stock for\nthe sole purpose of being transferred to nonprofit organizations.

Management believes it is more likely than not that some deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAccordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded on U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2021\nand 2020. The valuation allowance increased $ 298.7million and $ 35.5million during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was primarily attributable to net operating losses generated as a result of\nstock-based compensation windfall benefits. The valuation allowance decreased $ 2.3million during the fiscal year\nended January 31, 2019 and was primarily attributable to deferred tax liabilities generated from the capitalization\nof commissions for GAAP purposes.\n90\nTable of Contents\nWe intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and U.K. until\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. In our valuation\nallowance evaluation, we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified than to evidence that cannot\nbe objectively verified. Our consideration of the evidence requires management to make a number of significant\njudgments, estimates, and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters. Given our current\nearnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that in the foreseeable\nfuture, sufficient positive evidence may become available that results in a conclusion that a portion of the\nvaluation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of\ncertain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However,\nthe exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of\nprofitability (pretax income adjusted for permanent differences) that we are able to actually achieve.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1,264.3million for federal\nincome tax purposes, a small portion of which will begin to expire in 2032 if unused. We had net operating loss\ncarryforwards of approximately $ 797.0million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year\n2027 if unused. We also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 34.1million, which have an\nindefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 13.6million\nfor federal income tax and $ 11.4million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development tax\ncredit will begin to expire in 2036 if unused. State research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382\nand Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. The Tax Reform Act of\n1986 contains provisions that limit the federal net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year\nin the event of special occurrences, including significant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382\nreview and determined that none of our operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n(in thousands)\nBalance - January 31, 2018                 $                      1,976\nIncreases related to current year’s tax                             802\npositions\nBalance - January 31, 2019                                        2,778\nIncreases related to current year’s tax                           5,328\npositions\nBalance - January 31, 2020                                        8,106\nIncreases related to current year’s tax                           6,001\npositions\nIncreases related to prior year’s tax                               314\npositions\nCurrent year acquisitions                                           885\nLapse of statute of limitations                                    -422\nBalance - January 31, 2021                 $                     14,884\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, are $ 2.0million, $\n2.0million, and $ 1.0million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax\nrate.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. During the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2021, we recognized interest and penalties of $ 0.1million, and had a cumulative liability\nof $ 0.2million as of January 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, we recognized interest and\npenalties of $ 0.3million, and had a cumulative liability of $ 0.3million as of January 31, 2020. During the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2019, we recognized nointerest and penalties.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2021, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\n91\nTable of Contents\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was passed into law. On December 27,\n2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (2021) was passed into law. Both amended portions of relevant tax law and\ndid not have a significant impact on the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. We\nwill continue to monitor future guidance regarding these acts and other similar stimulus measures to determine any\nfuture impacts.\n11.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2021 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n93\nTable of Contents\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The\ndesign of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future\nevents, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all\npotential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the\ndegree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected."

BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables users to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications platform started with video as its foundation, and we have set the\nstandard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice for large\nenterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We connect people through our core unified communications\noffering, which frictionlessly brings together video, phone, chat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences\nacross disparate devices and locations. Our Developer Platform enables customers, developers, and service providers\nto easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-leading video communications platform, with\nopportunities for global discovery and distribution. Our virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to\nseamlessly create and manage engaging events.\nOur cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice solutions that are easy to use, manage,\nand deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; and is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces\nand applications. As businesses around the world navigate a period of significant work transformation, Zoom’s\nability to enable meaningful connections whether teams are in the office, at home, on-the-go, or in other locations\nsuch as a retail or manufacturing setting, is a critical differentiator. We believe that rich and reliable\ncommunications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution that is secure, reliable, and “just works.”\nA cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features\ndesigned to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users comprise both\nhosts, who organize video meetings, and individual attendees, who participate in those video meetings. In 2019, we\nlaunched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications platform. Many customers\nalso choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users to easily\nexperience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. In February 2022, we announced Zoom Contact Center, an\nomnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for video and integrated right into the same Zoom experience.\nThe happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites,\nincluding Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2021 Gartner Peer\nInsights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions and a TrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software. Industry\nanalysts also recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting\nSolutions for the sixth consecutive year, and a leader in the Magic Quadrant for UCaaS for a second year. Frost &\nSullivan recognized Zoom with its 2021 Global Webinars and Virtual Events Market Leadership Award. In 2021, we were\nalso recognized as a leader in IDC’s MarketScapes for UCaaS Service Providers (Small- and Medium-sized Businesses\nand Worldwide Enterprise) and for Worldwide Unified Communications and Collaboration, by Omdia Universe for\nCollaborative Meeting Services, and by Aragon Research Globes for Unified Communications and Collaboration and\nVideo Conferencing. We also received Aragon’s Innovation Award for Video Conferencing in both 2020 and 2021. Zoom\nwas also named to Fortune’s 2021 Future 50 list, which recognized innovative companies with high-growth potential\nwho are creating meaningful value for their customers.\nWe have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy\nfor optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience the simplicity and reliability of\nour platform – it “gets out of the way” so they can focus on what they need to get done together. This enthusiasm\ncontinues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales\nefforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer opportunity, which can\ninclude our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that\ndelights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these\npractices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our\nexisting customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nhosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the\n6\nTable of Contents\nZoom difference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that\nintegrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales\nrepresentatives, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively\ndrive upgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, and phone for the full Zoom\nUnified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) experience.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication and\ncollaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of\nengineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base.\nAccelerate international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world,\nwe are poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems.\nGrow our partnership ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Our platform integrates easily with other\nsystems and tools. We enable developers to embed our platform into their own offerings through open application\nprogram interfaces (“APIs”) and our cross-platform software development kits (“SDKs”). We have already partnered\nwith several hardware video conferencing and peripheral providers and with software providers, including Atlassian\nand Dropbox. Third-party developers are able to engage with the Zoom App Marketplace and Zoom Developer Platform to\nextend the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development of public and private apps and\nintegrations.\nOur Products\nWe provide a unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact,\nconnecting them through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing. Our core products include\nZoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Chat, Zoom Rooms, Zoom Hardware-as-a-Service, Zoom Conference Room Connector, Zoom\nEvents, Zoom Webinar, Zoom Developer Platform, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Contact Center.\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provide HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems. Our architecture can support up to 1,000 video participants in a single\nmeeting. Conversations can be one to one, one to many, or many to many. Zoom Meetings feature 49-person video\ngallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms, screen\nsharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more done\ntogether. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn,\nMicrosoft, Salesforce, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees who rely on their mobile\ndevice or tablet throughout their business day.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same 256-bit AES GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nZoom Phone\nZoom Phone is an enterprise cloud phone system that provides powerful private branch exchange (“PBX”) features,\nsuch as secure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail,\nswitch to video, and much more. Available stand-alone, or as an optional add-on to Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone is a\ncore component of our modern UCaaS strategy that enables customers to replace their existing PBX solution and\nconsolidate all of their business communications and collaboration requirements onto Zoom.\nZoom Phone provides inbound and outbound calling via its support for native connectivity to the public switched\ntelephone network (“PSTN”). In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, Zoom Phone provided native PSTN connectivity\nin more than 45 countries and territories.\n7\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone also supports Premise Peering and Cloud Peering, which provide customers with the flexibility to keep\ntheir current PSTN service providers by redirecting existing third-party voice circuits to the Zoom Phone cloud.\nHybrid connectivity is also supported, allowing customers to mix native Zoom Phone calling plans and third-party\nvoice circuits. This unique capability allows customers to enjoy all of the benefits and features of Zoom Phone\nwhile keeping their existing service provider contracts, phone numbers, and calling rates with their preferred\ncarrier of record.\nZoom Chat\nZoom Chat, which is included in the Zoom client for meeting and phone customers, enables organizations and teams to\ncommunicate and collaborate in groups, channels, or 1-1s and to stay connected by instantly sharing messages,\nimages, audio files, and other content across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. With Zoom Chat, users\ncan easily invite people outside their organization to a chat conversation, and users can quickly switch from a\nchat to a phone call or video meeting during a conversation. Zoom Chat also features content storage for users who\nwant discoverability and the ability to review their conversations or shared files. There are dozens of Zoom Chat\ncompatible applications available in the Zoom App Marketplace that provide notifications and improved workflow for\nother enterprise systems.\nZoom Rooms\nZoom Rooms is our software-based conference room system that transforms every room – from executive offices, huddle\nrooms, training rooms, to broadcast studios – into a collaboration space that is easy to use, simple to deploy, and\nlow-effort to manage. Designed to increase workforce collaboration across in-room and virtual participants, Zoom\nRooms bring one-click to join meetings, wireless multi-sharing, interactive whiteboarding, and intuitive room\ncontrols for a frictionless and secure Zoom Meeting experience. Zoom Rooms can leverage purpose-built hardware,\nsuch as Zoom Rooms Appliances, for a turnkey deployment, or users can customize room builds with Zoom’s open\nhardware ecosystem and professional audio/visual equipment, enabling organizations to build video-enabled spaces\nfor any use case.\nZoom Rooms Scheduling Display helps meet the needs of the agile office by delivering simple, on-the-fly room\nbooking and room utilization management through a calendaring system. With a single Zoom Rooms license, customers\nget unlimited access to this service, requiring only an iOS or Android touch display outside their rooms.\nZoom Rooms Digital Signage leverages displays, in and out of conference rooms, to project image, video, and URL\ncontent playlists. Included as part of Zoom Rooms, role-based admins can easily manage unlimited Digital Signage\ncontent and displays through the Zoom Admin Portal and remotely control the content displayed across screens for\ncorporate communications, internal marketing, branding, and more.\nZoom for Home is a personal home office solution designed to help remote workers connect and be more productive.\nThe leading providers of Zoom for Home compatible devices include Amazon, DTEN, Facebook, Google, Neat, Poly, and\nothers.\nZoom Hardware-as-a-Service\nOur Zoom Hardware-as-a-Service offering allows customers to access the latest and greatest video communication\ntechnology from third party equipment providers. Customers can deploy a world-class communications experience with\na variety of subscription options for phone and meeting room hardware. Customers can also scale video conference\nrooms and phones with hardware options and hardware refreshes at an affordable, fixed monthly price.\nZoom Conference Room Connector\nThe Zoom Conference Room Connector is a gateway for SIP/H.323 endpoints to join Zoom meetings. For organizations\nthat use SIP/H.323 conference room systems from providers, such as Poly and Cisco, Zoom’s Conference Room Connector\ncan take these traditional hardware video conferencing systems to the cloud, allowing users to leverage their\nexisting investments while taking advantage of the Zoom platform. As organizations transition from legacy hardware-\nbased conference rooms to software-based Zoom Rooms, IT administrators save cost on layers of service, maintenance,\nand support contracts and bridge their endpoints with Zoom Conference Room Connector. With the cost-savings,\norganizations can reinvest in video-enabling more rooms and continue to leverage their existing SIP/H.323 endpoints\nwith a consistent, cloud-based experience across all their rooms.\nZoom Events\nZoom Events provides businesses with a virtual event management solution powered by the Zoom platform. Zoom Events\nenables users to manage and host all types of internal and external virtual events, from small interactive sessions\nto multi-day and multi-track events like conferences or consumer events. This includes the ability to create a\n“hub” where all of a business’ events can be listed with corresponding information about each experience. It also\nenables event hosts to provide ticketing and registration for attendees, and the ability to track these activities.\n8\nTable of Contents\nOnZoom is a prosumer-focused virtual event platform and marketplace for Zoom users to create, host, and monetize\nonline events. OnZoom is an extension of Zoom’s unified communications platform with robust monetization (ticketing\nand fundraising) and simpler event management capabilities. OnZoom is currently offered as a public beta for United\nStates (“U.S.”) users to host and attend online events.\nZoom Webinars\nZoom Webinars support interactive video presentations to large audiences from almost anywhere in the world and from\nmany devices. Zoom Webinars scale up to 50,000 people, including up to 100 interactive video panelists. With\nwebinars, hosts have control over the video viewing experience and attendees join to listen, learn and interact\nusing chat, Q&A, live polling and more. Our powerful third-party integrations help users maximize usage of their\nwebinars and expand capabilities with paid registration, marketing automation, lead nurturing, and learning\nmanagement.\nZoom Developer Platform and Zoom App Marketplace\nThe Zoom Developer Platform enables developers, platform integrators, service providers, and customers to easily\nbuild apps and integrations that use Zoom’s video-based communications solutions across video, phone, chat, or\nintegrate Zoom’s core technology into their products and services, with opportunities for co-marketing, discovery\nand distribution. Our developer platform also allows Zoom customers to administer their accounts including managing\napp requests and provisioning, as well as optimizing account usage with access to dashboards and comprehensive\nusage metrics. With our SDKs, APIs, webhooks and extensive developer resources, Zoom, third-party developers, and\npartners build applications that integrate our platform with other globally in-demand applications, platforms,\nwebsites, and services. Our customers also have access to tools and resources to develop private applications that\nintegrate Zoom and Zoom technology into their workflows and systems.\nOur App Marketplace brings together integrations built by Zoom and third-party developers, making it easy for\ndevelopers to publish their apps and for customers to enhance their Zoom experience with new functionalities. The\nApp Marketplace features third-party integrations of Zoom into best of breed apps, Zoom Apps (third-party apps\nintegrated into the Zoom experience) and SDK apps (apps built by ISV program partners using our Meeting SDK). Key\nintegrations include Google Workspace, Calendly, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Otter.ai, Hubspot, Asana,\nKahoot! and Miro.\nZoom Apps combine users' favorite apps with the power of video communications by allowing users to access them\ndirectly in Zoom Meetings. Users can enrich their Zoom experience with a variety of apps that cover many use cases\n— including whiteboarding, project management, note-taking, gaming, and more.\nZoom Contact Center\nIn February 2022, we introduced Zoom Contact Center which combines contact center functionality with our Zoom\nunified communications solutions. Zoom Contact Center is currently available in the U.S. and Canada with additional\ninternational availability planned for later this year.\nOur Technology and Infrastructure\nOur unique technology and infrastructure enable best-in-class reliability, scalability, and performance. We\ndesigned our communications platform to be video-first and cloud-native. Most legacy approaches utilize single\nmultipoint control units (“MCUs”) to bridge video and voice participants into an integrated stream that is\nbroadcast back to the participants. These hardware devices are shipped with defined processing and memory capacity\nthat are difficult to scale. In addition, an MCU architecture is similar to other mainframe-like approaches where\nstream processing and mixing run on the same machine, which is resource-intensive and limits scalability.\nOur technology was specifically designed from the start to address the most difficult component of communications:\nvideo. Video requires intense computing resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, as\nwell as higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like\nvoice, chat, and content sharing. Our architecture separates video content processing from the transporting and\nmixing of streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that reside on client devices and\ndynamically encode and decode based upon the performance of client technology, network performance, and bandwidth.\nWe leverage a next-generation multimedia router that operates on commodity hardware and a globally distributed\ncloud infrastructure to determine the optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect\nthe participants.\nOur Customers\nWe have customers of all sizes, from individuals to global Fortune 50 organizations. Our current customer base\nspans numerous industry categories, including education, entertainment/media, enterprise infrastructure, finance,\ngovernment, health\n9\nTable of Contents\ncare, manufacturing, nonprofit/not for profit and social impact, retail/consumer products, and software/internet.\nNo individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nSales\nOur sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meetings plan with a sales approach\noptimized for the size of each customer opportunity. Our direct sales force includes our field sales\nrepresentatives as well as our inside sales team, and it is organized by customer employee count, region, and\nvertical. Our channel team coordinates the activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong\necosystem that broadens our reach. Our online channel supports high-volume, high-velocity, self-service sales.\nMarketing\nOur marketing team’s primary objective is to create preference for our brand by leveraging our viral growth,\nenhancing brand perception, and engaging our users with virtual events, content, social media, and customer\nadvisory councils. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out-of-home advertising. We shifted our\nevents strategy from in-person to online during the pandemic, including hosting Zoomtopia, our annual user\nconference, virtually to tens of thousands of attendees.\nResearch and Development\nWe drive our business with constant innovation. We have research and development presence in the United States,\nIndia, Singapore, and China, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to invest more in\nincreasing our product capabilities in an efficient manner with a “follow the sun” strategy.\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and GoTo, bundled productivity solution providers with video functionality,\nincluding Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams, and UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including 8x8, Avaya, and\nRingCentral, as well as consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including\nAmazon, Apple, and Facebook. Additionally, as we build out Zoom Contact Center, we may face additional competition,\nincluding from Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact.\nWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:\nvideo-first platform;\ncloud-native architecture;\nfunctionality and scalability;\nease of use and reliability;\nbrand awareness and preference;\nability to utilize existing infrastructure, such as legacy conference room hardware; and\nlow total cost of ownership.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections,\nto establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions\noriginating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the\nUnited States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and\nexternal controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. This may\ninclude open source software. We take steps to ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses governing such\nlicensed technology. We believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark,\ncopyright, trade secret, license, or\n10\nTable of Contents\nother intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, see\n“Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on\nour capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nNevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those\npertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material\nimpact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government\nregulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had 6,787 full-time employees. Of these employees, 4,009 are in the United States and\n2,778 are in our international locations. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Employees in\none of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefit of a collective bargaining agreement and are represented by a\nworkers’ council. We have not experienced interruptions of operations or any work stoppages due to labor\ndisagreements.\nOur Culture of Happiness\nWe are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We strive to change the way business is done\nthrough our communications technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we have an\nemployee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify our efforts to deliver happiness to our\nemployees and customers.\nOur culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision, and values and is fundamental to everything we do\nat Zoom:\nMission. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nVision. Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video communications.\nValues. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves.\nThis culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent.\nComparably recognized Zoom for numerous culture awards in 2021 including Best Company Happiness and Best CEO. Our\nemployees also named Zoom among the winners of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Awards honoring the Best Places to\nWork in 2021.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) at Zoom is an embodiment of our core value of Care. DEI also represents\nour intentional effort to create an inclusive environment of the brightest minds from a broad set of backgrounds in\norder to create the most innovative solutions for our customers. Our approach to DEI is driven across four\nstrategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how\nwe include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).\nWe have taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College,\nAnitaB.org, and a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, our Zoom Talks\ninitiative creates ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about one another’s unique backgrounds. We have a\nnumber of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women, Asian and Pacific Islander,\nVeteran, and LGBTQ+ communities. Our ERGs offer our employees support and community building opportunities, and\nhelp to foster an inclusive environment and diverse workplace. Our DEI Team continues to partner with teams leading\nour product design and marketing to invest in making our products even more inclusive and accessible to the diverse\nset of communities we serve.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. Our employees’\ntotal compensation packages include base pay, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best\ninterest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of\nour employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-\nsite work. We also provide flexible work hours in certain cases. We have also provided a work-from-home\nreimbursement policy to assist employees in that transition.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOver the past year, we conducted a comprehensive employee survey with regular follow-ups and engaged in peer\nresearch to make thoughtful decisions on how to move forward in an evolving world of work. Two priorities were\nimmediately clear: keeping our employees safe and supporting them through a meaningful employee experience. We\nbelieve that the future of work at Zoom will be based on enabling a flexible working environment for our employees.\nWe have created three \"workstyles\" for our employees (in-person, remote and hybrid) and will be allowing most\nemployees to choose their own workstyle.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2011 under the name Saasbee, Inc., and in\nFebruary 2012, we changed our name to Zoom Communications, Inc.

The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers and hosts, retain and upsell additional products to\nexisting customers, and upgrade free hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers and hosts, renewals,\nor upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and maintain and expand our relationships\nwith our customers and hosts, including upselling additional products to our existing customers and upgrading hosts\nto a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting\nand invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting\nplan as “paid hosts.”\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers\nwill renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,\nor purchase additional products, if they\n12\nTable of Contents\nrenew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such\nas dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no longer having a need for our products,\nincluding any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic that may\nsubsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic has tapered, or the perception that\ncompetitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In addition, some customers downgrade\ntheir Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a result of the increased usage of our\nplatform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted largely from businesses and enterprises to a\nmix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could result in higher non-renewal rates than we\nhave experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and hosts to grow our business beyond our\ncurrent user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to continue to use our platform. Finally, any\ndecrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and\nability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by\nrecommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand\nwithin organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\nZoom into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we strive to demonstrate the value\nof our platform and various product offerings to those hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan, thereby\nencouraging them to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including those that\nsubscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and work-from-home\nmandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts of our\nfree Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within organizations, our business\nwould be harmed.\nIn addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase and we\nturn our focus to upgrading our free hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan rather than growing the total number of\nusers. If we are not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or\ndecline. While we continue to add paid users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to\nslow or decline as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to taper, particularly as vaccines become widely\navailable and distributed, and users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to limitations on\nin-person meetings.\nOur revenue growth rate has begun to decline and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in future\nperiods.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any\nprior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue growth rate has begun to\ndecline and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute\nto declines in our growth rate, including higher market penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our\nplatform, especially once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic tapers, particularly as vaccines become widely\navailable and distributed, and users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to limitations on\nin-person meetings, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our\nbusiness, among others. Declines in our growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business\nand the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors,\nincluding increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, would impair the delivery of our services, require\nus to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers in\norder to optimize performance on our platform. Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past\nresulted in and could in the future result in interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, other interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety\nof other factors, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors,\nviruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in\nusage, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that\nimpacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new\ndata centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or\ntransfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite\nprecautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in\nthe delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay\npenalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause customers and hosts to terminate their\n13\nTable of Contents\nsubscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts. Our ability to attract and\nretain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide customers and hosts with a highly reliable platform\nand even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, including increased\nusage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek\nto obtain additional capacity, which could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications\nplatform because of its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers\nto meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner,\nincluding as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term\ncapacity needs, we may need to rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and\nOracle Cloud, which may result in higher variable costs, harming our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and similar events, any of which could disrupt\nour service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant\nperiod of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for\nall eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of\nterrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other\nunanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain\nfeatures of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products\noffered by:\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect\ncompetition to intensify in the future. For example, we recently introduced Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel\ncontact center solution that is optimized for video, which, as we build out our offering, may result in increased\ncompetition against companies that offer similar services, such as Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact, and new\ncompetitors that may enter that market in the future. Also, in connection with the travel restrictions and stay-in-\nplace policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from\nsmaller customers, many of whom are consumers or small and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller\ncustomers, we face competition from more consumer-oriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the\nconsumer market than we do. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive\nadvantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and\nservices; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing relationships; more third-party integration; greater\naccessibility across devices or applications; greater access to larger user bases; major distribution agreements\nwith hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical, and other resources. Some of our\ncompetitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these\ntrends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nforced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain customers in\n14\nTable of Contents\nresponse to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on occasion, offer customers a free\nperiod of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in deferred billings or long-term accounts\nreceivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts receivable.\nOur quarterly results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the\nunderlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter\nshould not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate\nas a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully\nreflect the underlying performance of our business. For example, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30,\n2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our unified communications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant portion of which is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet\nthis increased demand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading\nour infrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on\npublic cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the\nvalue of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include,\nwithout limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our\npaid Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles, especially with respect to sales to large enterprises and highly regulated\nindustries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases; and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service; network outages; or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits; regulatory actions or investigations; legislator scrutiny; or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users grow and their usage\nof communications capacity increases, including increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be\nrequired to make additional investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the\navailability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity\nis not available to us as our user base grows, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high\ndata transmission capacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third\nparties providing internet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not\nhave access to our platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate\nof adoption of new technologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently\nadapt to the increased demand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause\ncurrent or potential users to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our\ncompetitors or to avoid our platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The\norder requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management\npractices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient\nto enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and\nother small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June\n11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to\nthe new rules, but reversed the FCC’s decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband\ninternet service, requiring case-by-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the\nFCC’s rules. The court also required the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to\nremain in effect, while the FCC conducts that review. On February 6, 2020, the court denied requests for rehearing\nof the original decision, and the deadline for petitions requesting the Supreme Court to review the decision has\npassed without the filing of any such petitions. On February 19, 2020, the FCC released a public notice asking for\ncomment on the three issues the court required it to reexamine. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order\nconcluding that the three issues remanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018\norder. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending. Democratic control of the Executive Branch,\nCongress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the likelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse\nthe 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are\nadopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A\nfederal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network\nneutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. On March 10, 2021, trade\nassociations representing internet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary\ninjunction, and the appeal was denied on January 28, 2022. The trade associations have sought rehearing with the\nfull court of appeal. We cannot predict whether the FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced,\nmodified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s new\nrules, broadband internet access providers may be able to charge web-based services such as ours for priority\naccess or favor services offered by our competitors or by the internet access providers themselves, which could\nresult in increased costs and a loss of existing customers and hosts, impair our ability to attract new customers\nand hosts, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater\ndeployment challenges.\nAs we continue to grow, we have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large\norganizations typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size,\norganizational structure, and approval requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face\nunexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large\norganizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional\nsecurity management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large\norganizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our\nplatform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we\nanticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater\nunpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if any new customers or hosts that have\nsubscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the\nimpact of the pandemic has tapered, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe expect to increase our expenses in the future, which could decrease our profitability or prevent us from\nmaintaining profitability.\nAlthough we generated net income of $1,375.6 million, $672.3 million, and $25.3 million for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, we have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses\nin the future. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing\nefforts to attract new customers and hosts and to develop and enhance our products and for general corporate\npurposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses,\nupgrading our infrastructure, and addressing security and privacy issues, including those stemming from the\nunprecedented numbers of first-time users during the COVID-19 pandemic who may not have full IT support or\nestablished protocols like our larger customers, and expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we are\nsuccessful in increasing our user base, we may also incur increased losses because, other than sales commissions,\nthe costs associated with acquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the subscription\nrevenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear\nbasis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our\n17\nTable of Contents\nrevenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in decreased profitability. We may incur\nsignificant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described\nherein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. For example, we\nhave faced unprecedented usage during the COVID-19 pandemic and, to meet this increased demand, have incurred and\nexpect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our\ncapacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have to rely on public cloud providers rather than our\nown data centers. While free users continue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing\nprograms focused on converting free users to paid subscriptions. Some of these new hosts using our platform on a\nfree Basic account have upgraded to a paid Zoom Meeting plan but the remainder have not and may never do so. If we\nare unable to increase or sustain our profitability, the value of our business and Class A common stock may\nsignificantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer\ndemand for our platform, user adoption and renewal of our platform, the entry of competitive products and services,\nor the success of existing competitive products and services. As a result, we may not increase or maintain\nprofitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and\nother expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other\nproductivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors\nown, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute\noperating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform\nrequires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and\nservices that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business\npartners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from\ncustomers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and\nproducts; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.\nOur customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest\nsignificantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality\nand ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic\n18\nTable of Contents\nuser demand for our platform. There is no assurance that new additions or other future enhancements to our platform\nor new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or\nthat they will perform as expected. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user\ndemand or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a\ntimely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing\nthat could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,\nor capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and\ncapabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released\naccording to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or\nclaims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to\nour platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.\nIf customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not\nperform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,\nlicense, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such\nenhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and\nservices will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan\nto continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are\nunable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to\nacquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our\nefforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our\nnew sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our\nsales and marketing programs are not effective.\nOur security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security\nmeasures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,\nexpose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products\nand services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or\nceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of customer and user information. Security incidents have\noccurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or unauthorized\ndisclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of, this information, interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations\nand services, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, and other\npossible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales, and harm\nour business.\nCyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase, and cloud-based platform providers\nof products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. In addition to traditional computer\n“hackers,” we face security risks from sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced\npersistent threat intrusions. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to\nsocial-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms),\nmalware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as\ncredential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions,\nsoftware or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications\nfailures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by\norganized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly\nprevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income,\nreputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware\nattack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations\nprohibiting such payments. If our security measures are compromised, our reputation could be damaged; our data,\ninformation or intellectual property, or that of our\n19\nTable of Contents\ncustomers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised; our business may be harmed; and we could incur\nsignificant liability. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future to anticipate or\nprevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our services or software or third-party\nsoftware, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems, because such threats and techniques change\nfrequently and are generally not detected until after an incident has occurred. In addition, security researchers\nand other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to actively search for and exploit actual\nand potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may increase because of increased demand\nfor our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications platform, and can lead to additional\nadverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats, business and operational interruptions, security\nincidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory investigations and actions, and substantial harm to our\nbusiness, some of which we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security\nresearcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the Zoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on\nfeatures. We were able to release updates to the software addressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of\nany customers being affected or meetings compromised by these vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are\nresponsible for installing this update to the software, and their software is subject to these vulnerabilities\nuntil they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security researcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to\nour macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized person to gain root access to a user’s system.\nGiven the nature of our business and operations, our products and services will inevitably contain vulnerabilities\nor critical security defects that have not been identified or remediated and cannot be disclosed without\ncompromising security. We have identified vulnerabilities in our products and services in the past, and we expect\nthat we will continue to identify vulnerabilities in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to\naddress any vulnerabilities in our software products and services that we may become aware of in the future, or\nthere may be delays in developing patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. We expect\nsecurity issues to arise in the future as our products and services are more widely adopted, and as we continue to\nexpand the features and functionality of existing products and introduce new products.\nWhile we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in an effort to protect against\nsecurity incidents and to mitigate, detect, and remediate actual and potential vulnerabilities, we will continue to\nmake prioritization decisions to determine which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these\nfixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security. Further, in many cases, customers are\nresponsible for installing our software updates, and until they do so, their service remains subject to the\nvulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, errors in\nremediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remediate vulnerabilities or\nsecurity defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to install software updates could\nresult in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nSecurity incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security\nmay also cause some of our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their\nsubscriptions. Further, as we rely on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, we depend in part on third-party\nsecurity measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and the mishandling of data and\ninformation. Failures to meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality of\ntheir data and information could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and hosts,\nattract new customers and hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or security\nvulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including class\naction litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs for\nremediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in\ncustomer, host, and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to\naddress cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and\nsettlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because of any such incident.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving\ncertain types of personal data. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach\nis costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches. Security\ncompromises experienced by our competitors, our customers, or us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to\nwidespread negative publicity. In addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States,\nlike many similarly situated technology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel\nin China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and\nmedia scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.\nAny security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence\nin the effectiveness of our security measures; negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts;\ncause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions; or subject us to third-party lawsuits,\nregulatory investigations, proceedings, and fines, or other action or liability, which could harm our business and\nreputation. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our\nbrand could lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a\n20\nTable of Contents\nnegative perception of our information security and potential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For\nexample, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time\nusers, leading to challenges for users who did not have full IT support or established protocols for security and\nprivacy like our larger customers. As a result, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting\ndisruptions and security and privacy issues, including on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could\nresult in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of\nuse, or other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities\nor damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability\ninsurance coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer\nwill not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that\nare not covered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our\nbusiness.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that our brand identity and awareness have contributed to our success and have helped fuel our efficient\ngo-to-market strategy. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, voice, chat, and content sharing.\nWe also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers,\nhosts, and users and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad\ncommunications platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users incorrectly view the Zoom\nbrand primarily as a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform with multiple\ncommunications solutions, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market position may\nbe detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and\nenhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or perception of our\nplatform, including any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints stemming from increased\nusage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or of our privacy or security features, or of the providers of communication\nand collaboration technologies generally, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and\nretain hosts. Similarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or perceived\nviolation by our employees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause us\nreputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our\nbusiness, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public\nperception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be\nharmed.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our headcount has grown from 4,422 full-\ntime employees as of January 31, 2021, to 6,787 full-time employees as of January 31, 2022, with employees located\nboth in the United States and internationally. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous,\nsignificant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to\nsupport our user base, our expanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our\ninternal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to\ngrow, we face challenges integrating, developing, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various\ncountries around the world. For example, a significant number of our employees were hired in the last two years and\nhave never been to one of our office locations. Certain members of our management have not previously worked\ntogether for an extended period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a public company, which may\naffect how they manage our growth. Managing our growth will also require significant expenditures and allocation of\nvaluable management resources.\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for\nand model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties\nfrequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary\nlevel of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth,\nour business would be harmed.\nOur business may be significantly affected by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer\nor business spending.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nany resulting effect on spending by our customers, and inflation. While some of our customers may consider our\nplatform to be\n21\nTable of Contents\na cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform as\na discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their discretionary spending on our platform during an\neconomic downturn. Given current economic conditions, including inflation, we could experience a reduction in\ndemand and loss of customers, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact\non various industries that our unified communications platform addresses. We would lose customers as a result of\ncustomers ceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer payment cycles and greater\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. While we have seen increased usage stemming\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free\nBasic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. Moreover, while we continue to add paid users to our customer\nbase, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or decline as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to taper, particularly in light of a potential economic downturn.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. While we seek to prepare\nfor such transitions, including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning, such\nchanges may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a\nresult of management turnover or otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need\nto be altered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement\n22\nTable of Contents\nsuch changes in a timely manner. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience employee turnover\nas a result of the ongoing “great resignation” occurring throughout the U.S. economy. New hires require training\nand take time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and\nwe may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If we fail to attract new personnel\nor fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. Moreover, as we plan to reopen our offices, vaccine mandates and similar government orders\nand restrictions could result in employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting. We must also continue to retain\nand motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development\nopportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our IPO, employees joining us at different times could have\nsignificant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which could create disparities\nin wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees and our business. Further,\nthe volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less attractive to current and potential\nemployees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in hiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 33%, 31%, and 19% of our total revenue for the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in further\nselect international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with global users, and we\nexpect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions\nand providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any\nnew markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our\nplatform may not be receptive. For example, if we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-specific\nrequirements, we may experience service outages or other adverse consequences which would impair our ability to\nexpand further into certain markets. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations\ninternationally in the future may require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international\nexpansion will require investment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex\nemployment- and compensation-related laws, regulations, and practices in these international jurisdictions, and\nmaintaining our company culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to\nemployees in certain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations.\nThis may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash\ncompensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees\nin these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, and\nunsolicited email,\n23\nTable of Contents\nand the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our practices are deemed to be\nout of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as does the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as does the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United\nStates, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual\nproperty outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”) withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade\nprotection measures, import or export requirements, trade embargoes, and other trade barriers;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a\ntimely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nIn addition, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, NATO deployed additional military\nforces to Eastern Europe, and the United States, European Union, and other nations announced various sanctions\nagainst Russia. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be taken in\nfuture, by the U.S., NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could result in a\nregional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could\nadversely affect our business.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and\nregulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease\noperations in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, while our engineering team is headquartered in the\nUnited States, we employ a product development team that has a relatively significant footprint in China today,\nwhere personnel costs are less expensive than in many other geographies. This product development team carries out\nthe design and architecture decisions made by our U.S. engineering team. We also intend to expand our research and\ndevelopment presence in Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as in Singapore and India. As a\nresult of this expansion, we could experience, among other things, difficulty in attracting and retaining talent in\nthese locations and higher operating expenses, which would adversely impact our operating margins and harm our\nbusiness.\nAt the same time, our operations in China have caused and may in the future cause us to be subject to regulatory\nscrutiny both in China and in the United States. For example, in September 2019, the Chinese government turned off\nour service in China without warning and requested that we take certain steps prior to restoring our service,\nincluding designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests and transferring China-based user data\nhoused in the United States to a data center in China. Also, in June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the\nDepartment of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\n24\nTable of Contents\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took relating to the Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. The NDCA\nsubpoena also requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We are fully\ncooperating with these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These\ninvestigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover\nas a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the\noutcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur\nsubstantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan\nmust be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers\nand hosts and, consequently, our business.\nWe have designed our platform to be easy to adopt and use with minimal to no support necessary. However, if we\nexperience increased user demand for support, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations.\nSurging demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to allocate additional resources to support our\nexpanded user base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time. In addition,\nas we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide\nefficient support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. Customers and hosts receive\nadditional support features, and the number of our hosts has grown significantly, which will put additional\npressure on our support organization. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we\nneed to hire additional support personnel, including as a result of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour business may be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and\non positive recommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our\nbusiness.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor\ntheir products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant\ntime and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to\nscale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and\ntraining. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to\n25\nTable of Contents\neffectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop\nrelationships with new resellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to\nmanage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of\nnew customers and hosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our\nbusiness.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nsmall amount is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of\nthe jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\n22.6%, 20.2%, and 9.4% of our revenue, respectively, and 16.8%, 11.9%, and 17.5% of our expenses, respectively,\nwere denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations\nin currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could\nmaterially impact our results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to increase our sales to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency customers, which may\noccur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers and/or through direct\nsales to government entities. We received authorization under the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) that allows U.S. federal government agencies and contractors to securely use our Zoom for\nGovernment offering. The additional risks and challenges associated with doing business with governmental entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that differ less favorably from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould expect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability\nunder the civil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced by public sector budgetary cycles and funding\nauthorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector demand for our\nproducts; and\ngovernment-imposed vaccine mandates could result in increased attrition and difficulties in recruiting, and non-\ncompliance with any such mandates could restrict our ability to do business with governmental entities.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be\nrequired to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive\nOrder, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our\ncompliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the\nU.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur current products, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase\nour base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially\nsuffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products\nto new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our products, or\nthe introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current products, as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate\ncarriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that\nwill use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our\nmargins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the future\nmay similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third parties, all of which would lower our profit margins for\nany such new products. If this trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could\nharm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid host base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses;\nchanges in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to\nuse, deferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples; changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; other\nfundamental changes in tax law currently being considered by many countries; and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. Absent a change in legislation, we expect it will have a\nmaterial impact on our cash flows beginning in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. Although Congress is\nconsidering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, we have no assurance that the\nprovision will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue derived from digital\nservices. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of the OECD's\nInclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing\nour future tax obligations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nFor state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or\notherwise limited, including a California franchise tax law change limiting the usability of California state net\noperating losses to offset California taxable income in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and\nbefore January 1, 2022.\nWe have maintained a valuation allowance on all our U.S. and U.K. net deferred tax assets since our inception as it\nwas determined that it was more likely than not that we would not recognize the benefits of these assets. We\ncontinued to record a valuation allowance through the first nine months of fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2022, management concluded that the valuation allowance related to the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\nassets was no longer needed primarily due to its assessment of income/loss in recent periods and the forecast of\nfuture taxable income. As of January 31, 2022, based on evaluation of the positive and negative evidence,\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized for U.S. federal\nand state purposes. Accordingly, management has recognized a non-recurring tax benefit of $328.0 million related to\nthe valuation allowance reversal. As of January 31, 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $12.6\nmillion related to net deferred tax assets of our U.K. subsidiary and will maintain this valuation allowance until\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or a portion of the allowance.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not\nultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be\nviewed negatively by users, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired\nbusinesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to\nsuccessfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our\ncompany, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process\nwill require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary\nfunctioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which could harm our\nbusiness. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast\nthe financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nBeginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our unified communications\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for\nand model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our\nfuture performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue\n28\nTable of Contents\ngrowth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our\nplatform; increased competition; contraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for\nour platform and plan for capacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth\nopportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made it difficult to forecast revenue, costs, and expenses, as our\nplatform has recently faced unprecedented usage from free users and new and existing customers, requiring us to\ndevote significant resources to bolster our capacity and infrastructure. We have encountered and will encounter\nrisks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the\nrisks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use\nto plan our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would\nbe harmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners, or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nprivacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual\nobligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.\nWe receive, store, process, generate, use, and share personal information and other customer and user content\nnecessary to provide our service and ensure it is delivered effectively, to operate our business, for legal and\nmarketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. There are numerous federal, state, local, and\ninternational laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the collection,\nstoring, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content,\nthe scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among\ncountries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual\nobligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. Although we endeavor to\ncomply with applicable laws and our policies, publications, certifications, and documentation, and other\nobligations, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our\nefforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, vendors or business partners do not\ncomply with our policies, certifications, and documentation. Any actual or perceived compliance failure, as well as\ngreater public scrutiny of our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, could result in\nincreased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a\nloss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nFor example, in June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice for the EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign\npolitical parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user\ndata, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the\nTiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various\nsecurity, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as\nwell as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks\ninformation relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any\nattempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as\nthey relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking\nrelated information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own\nthorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed,\nwhich facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or\nmay not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these\nmatters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material\nreputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our\nbusiness.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, industry standards, guidance and\ncontractual obligations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in\nvarious jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect\nin the EU, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) implemented the U.K. GDPR. The GDPR and the U.K. GDPR impose more\nstringent data protection requirements and provide greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data\nprotection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions on data processing, and\nfines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers’,\npartners’, or vendors’ failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or\nrestrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our product and services. We may\nalso be obligated to assist our customers, partners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the\nGDPR, which could require expenditure of significant resources.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border data transfer laws. For example, absent\nappropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal information to\ncountries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, which the European Commission does not consider to provide\nan adequate level of data privacy and security. The European Commission released a set of Standard Contractual\nClauses that are designed to be a lawful mechanism by which entities can transfer personal information out of the\nEEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. The\nStandard Contractual Clauses require parties that rely upon them to comply with additional obligations, such as\nconducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect\nthe at-issue personal information. Moreover, due to potential legal challenges, there exists some uncertainty\nregarding whether the Standard Contractual Clauses will remain a valid mechanism for transfers of personal\ninformation out of the EEA. In addition, laws in Switzerland and the U.K. similarly restrict transfers of personal\ninformation outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the United States that do not provide an adequate\nlevel of personal information protection.\nIn addition to European restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information, other jurisdictions have\nenacted or are considering similar cross-border personal information transfer laws and local personal information\nresidency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot implement a\nvalid compliance mechanism for cross-border transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions,\nsubstantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe or\nelsewhere. The inability to import personal information to the United States could significantly and negatively\nimpact our business operations; limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European and\nother privacy, data protection, and information security laws; or requiring us to increase our personal information\nprocessing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\nWe are also subject to evolving EU and U.K. privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. European regulators are\nincreasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current\nnational laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are likely to be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation, which\ncould lead to substantial costs, limit the effectiveness of our marketing and personalization activities, and\nsubject us to additional liabilities.\nStates have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. For example, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy\nprotections. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). The CCPA will be\nexpanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), which was\napproved by California voters in November 2020, becomes fully operative. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA, and their\ninterpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in\nan effort to comply.\nThe CCPA appears to mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States,\nas other states have followed California’s lead and increase protections for their residents. The CCPA has already\nprompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our\npotential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective\nOctober 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among\nother things, that businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from\nconsumers to opt out of the sale of their personal information. Virginia and Colorado have similarly enacted\ncomprehensive privacy laws, the Consumer Data Protection Act and Colorado Privacy Act, respectively, both laws of\nwhich emulate the CCPA and CPRA in many respects. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act takes effect on January\n1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act takes effect on July 1, 2023.\nThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a U.S. Federal law that applies to operators of\ncommercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal\ninformation from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are\ncollecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications services to\nschools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid classrooms, distance\nlearning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these services, Zoom may be used\nby students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect\n30\nTable of Contents\npersonal information from such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually\nconsent to Zoom’s information practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services. In addition,\nthe GDPR prohibits certain processing of the personal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on\nthe country) without parental consent. If we fail to accurately anticipate the application, interpretation, or\nlegislative expansion of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions,\ndata processing restrictions, litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as\na result of any such failures, we could be in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could\nlose trust in us, which could harm our reputation and business.\nWith laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and UK GDPR in the EU as well as the CCPA, SPI Law, HIPAA, and COPPA in\nthe United States imposing relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the\ninterpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we have faced and may face additional\nchallenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices. Additional\nuses of our services arising out of increased demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require us to\naddress additional privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and\ncontractual obligations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and\nfeatures, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and\nprocess user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,\ndisclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and\ncustomers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their\nown IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with\ncontrol over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by\nmalicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our\nproducts directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened\ntougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S.\n31\nTable of Contents\nproducts. The direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure\nand are only one part of a larger U.S./China economic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are\nuncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or\nworsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the United States\nand its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to\nglobal trade, including retaliatory trade restrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot\npredict what actions may ultimately be taken by the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade\nrelations between the United States and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or\nwhat actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between\nthe United States and China could exacerbate these actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the\nimplementation of China’s national-security law in Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could\npotentially increase the risks associated with the business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in\nChina. Any alterations to our business strategy or operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such\nchanges would be time-consuming and expensive, and certain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or\nreact to these changes.\nFurther, in recent years, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and\ncommunications technology and services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions.\nIn May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to\nimplement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national\nsecurity risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to\ncontracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce\nissued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS transactions that pose a national\nsecurity risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as China. Several aspects of this rule\nremain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule will be implemented and enforced in\npractice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement\nfurther restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty\nregarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will\nsuccessfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the\nexecutive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business,\nincluding in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced\nsales.\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations which are\nsubject to varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as\nours, uncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional\ntaxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical\npresence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales\nof our platform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus\nfor sales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently\nmade our software products available to some customers in potential violation of the EAR. As a result, we have\nsubmitted and from time to time\n32\nTable of Contents\nwill continue to submit as warranted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures regarding compliance with U.S.\nsanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry\nand Security (“BIS”). For instance, in June 2021, we submitted an initial voluntary self-disclosure to BIS\nregarding compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and regulations.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that\ncould result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,\nchanges in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with\nthe laws.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the\nhost or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful\nbehavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety\nteam may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or\nreferral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as\na result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely\nbetween jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to\nlegal actions along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may\nface, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the\ncontent shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nOur platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has\nbeen blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,\nor fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we\ncould be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\"), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-\nbribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their\nemployees and intermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or\nbenefits to government officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public\ncompanies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation\nand to device and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to\nprevent violations of anti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to\nexpand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n33\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (\"VoIP\") service provider. [As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access.] Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time.\nIn addition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nChanges in FCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations\non our other services. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that three issues remanded by the\nU.S. Court of Appeals following the appeal of its 2018 decision to eliminate its network neutrality rules did not\nprovide a basis to alter its conclusions in that order. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending.\nDemocratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the\nlikelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. Such\naction could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the\nones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to\nmodify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation\ncould result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many\nMembers of Congress from both parties support reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional\naction remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to adopt rules\ninterpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that is\ntransmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a vote\non that proposal and the FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The\nDemocratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of\nthe FCC. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or\nthe FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of protection offered by Section 230. In\naddition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to\ninternet platforms, including a lawsuit by former President Trump that, if successful, would greatly limit the\nscope of Section 230. These various efforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the\nrisks faced by internet-based businesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted\nagainst us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims.\nIf we are found liable for our customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or\npenalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and\nto avoid future liability.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer and the California Public Utilities Commission is now taking the position\nthat it can require VoIP providers like Zoom Phone to obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass\nUSF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in\nour products becoming more expensive. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts\nto apply state telecommunications regulations to services like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or\nfuture state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may\nhave to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nA federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network\nneutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. Trade associations\nrepresenting internet service\n34\nTable of Contents\nproviders appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction, and the appeal was denied on\nJanuary 28, 2022. This decision could be appealed to the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court, or the parties\ncould return to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether a permanent injunction should be\ngranted. We cannot predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas and has been introduced in at least fifteen additional states\nthat is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses operating on the Internet to moderate user-\ngenerated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections granted under Section 230. In response to\nchallenges from industry groups, federal courts have enjoined enforcement of the Florida and Texas laws, but\nappeals are pending in both cases. It is likely that any other such state legislation also would be challenged\nunder the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it is preempted by Section 230. We cannot\npredict whether any such state legislation will be adopted, enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every\nsignificant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an\nimportant factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately\nprotect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in\nthose trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may\nknowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third parties may challenge our proprietary right;\npending and future\n35\nTable of Contents\npatent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to prevent infringement\nwithout incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our\nproprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we\nrely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third\nparties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an\nadequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may\nindependently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or\ndevelop similar technologies and processes. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same\nlevel of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks,\ntrade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain\ncountries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending\nour intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of\ntheft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including\ntechnical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our\nintellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial\nadvantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary\nto enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is\ninadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible\nassets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features.\nAny of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our\nlicensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open\nsource software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in the usage of our unified communications platform,\nand as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly increased, while at the same time,\nthe broader market has experienced significant declines and volatility. There are no assurances that the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock will\n36\nTable of Contents\ncontinue at this level for any period of time. Moreover, the trading price of our Class A common stock could\nexperience a significant decrease once the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is better understood. These\nfluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could\ncause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020, and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2022, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 67.8% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n60.8% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2022, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.6% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 29.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one\nshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or\nincapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing\nservices to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of\nthe then\n37\nTable of Contents\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the\nclosing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly\npublic companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected\nindices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the\nS&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for\ninclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies may\ndepress the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from the indices or depress our trading volume\ncompared to those of other similar companies that are included.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\n38\nTable of Contents\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable\n39\nTable of Contents\nfuture. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation as the\nonly way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using legacy communication\nmethods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product feature that every\ncustomer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform does not provide. The\nvariables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no\nguarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates\nwill purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the markets in which\nwe compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons\noutside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm\nour business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted virtually every\ncountry in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an\nadverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service\ndisruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to\nsupport our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. We have removed the 40-minute time\nlimit from our free Basic accounts for customers in K-12 schools in certain countries. While we have seen increased\nusage of our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which\ndo not generate any revenue. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or\nthat new or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels after the COVID-19 pandemic has\ntapered. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has required and will\ncontinue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment.\nLikewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit\nin favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have\ninvested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex\ndue to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and\ntiming of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to\nmitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for\na set period of time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of\n40\nTable of Contents\na partial or total loss of investment capital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment\ncapital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of\nequity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to\nthe rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure\n41\nTable of Contents\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence\nin our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of\nour Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able\nto remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual management report on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management."

                "content": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables users to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications platform started with video as its foundation, and we have set the\nstandard for innovation ever since. We connect people through our core unified communications offering, which\nfrictionlessly brings together video, phone, chat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences across\ndisparate devices and locations. Our Developer Platform enables customers, developers, and service providers to\neasily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-leading video communications platform, with\nopportunities for global discovery and distribution. Our virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to\nseamlessly create and manage engaging events. We believe that face-to-face communications build greater empathy and\ntrust. We strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution while\nprioritizing their privacy and security. Our 24 co-located data centers worldwide and the public cloud enable us to\nprovide both high-quality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth environments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications platform. Subscription revenue is\ndriven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products, including Zoom Rooms,\nZoom Webinars, Zoom Phone, Zoom Events, and Hardware-as-a-Service (“HaaS”) for rooms and phones. A host is any user\nof our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join\nthat meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We define a customer as\na separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid user or host or an organization of any size\n(including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Basic offering is free and gives\nhosts access to Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that meetings with more than two endpoints\ntime-out at 40 minutes. Our paid offerings include our Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education, and Healthcare plans,\nwhich provide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant limits, administrative\ncontrols, and reporting.\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in three specific markets (United States/Canada, United\nKingdom/Ireland, and Australia/New Zealand). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in more than 45 countries and territories\nwhere Zoom has local public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) coverage. In addition, the Zoom United plan\nlaunched in December 2020 provides a single license for customers to purchase Zoom Phone, Meetings and chat\ncapabilities as a bundled offering.\nOur revenue was $4,099.9 million, $2,651.4 million, and $622.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rate of 55% and 326% for fiscal year 2022 and\nfiscal year 2021, respectively. We had net income of $1,375.6 million, $672.3 million, and $25.3 million for the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was\n$1,605.3 million, $1,471.2 million, and $151.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively.\n44\nTable of Contents\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, affecting many countries around the\nworld. Governments have instituted lockdown or other similar measures to slow infection rates. Many organizations\nhave resorted to mandating employees to work from home, which has resulted in these organizations seeking out video\ncommunication solutions like ours to keep employees as productive as possible, even while working from home.\nSchools, colleges, and universities globally have also closed as a result of this pandemic. Many of these\ninstitutions are utilizing our platform to provide remote instruction to their students. To help teachers and\nstudents navigate this unprecedented situation, we have temporarily removed the 40-minute time limit for meetings\nwith more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 domains worldwide.\nWhile we have experienced a significant increase in paid hosts and revenue due to the pandemic, the aforementioned\nfactors have also driven increased usage of our services and have required us to expand our network, data storage,\nand processing capacity, both in our own co-located data centers as well as through third-party cloud hosting,\nwhich has resulted, and is continuing to result, in an increase in our operating costs. Furthermore, a significant\nportion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free Basic accounts and our removal of the time\nlimit for school domains, which do not generate any revenue, but still require us to incur these additional\noperating costs to expand our capacity. Therefore, the recent increase in usage of our platform has adversely\naffected, and may continue to adversely affect, our gross margin.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or that new or existing users\nwill continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has tapered globally. Moreover, the tapering of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as vaccines become widely available and distributed, may result in a decline in\npaid hosts and users once individuals are no longer working or attending school from home.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or\nthe future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and\nmarketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who\nare able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or geography, before\nrolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have deployed our platform\nglobally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of our platform\nalso provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers, such as Zoom Phone,\nZoom HaaS, Zoom for Home, Zoom Rooms at each office location, Developer Platform solutions, Zoom Events, and Zoom\nVideo Webinars. In order for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing\ncustomers, we will need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that\nare responsive to our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion\nrate includes the increase in user adoption within our customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven\nby the number of paid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our\nsubscription revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion\nrate as of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all customers with more than 10\nemployees as of 12 months prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of\nsubscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring\nrevenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription\nagreements from all customers for the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have\nnot provided any indication that they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these\ncustomers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and\nattrition. We divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For\nthe trailing 12-months calculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12\nmonths. Our net dollar expansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of\npenetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers.\nOur trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for customers with more\n45\nTable of Contents\nthan 10 employees was 129% as of January 31, 2022 and greater than 130% as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. The\ntrailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees was under 130% as of January\n31, 2022 as the denominator of this trailing 12-month metric reflects the significant growth in our customer base\nduring the last two years.\nAs our business has changed and evolved, we have expansively built out our direct sales team, resellers, and\nstrategic partners. We expect that revenue from customers engaged through these channels, which we call Enterprise\ncustomers, will constitute an increasingly higher percentage of our revenue over time, and therefore we believe our\nperformance with Enterprise customers is a more important factor affecting our business than our performance with\nexisting customers with more than 10 employees. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we will no\nlonger present the trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees. However,\nwe will still provide this metric through the end of fiscal year 2023 in the appendix to the investor deck that we\nwill continue to post on our investor relations website each quarter at investors.zoom.us. Going forward, we will\ninstead provide the trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nOur net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers is calculated the same way as discussed above by applying\nthe ARR specifically from Enterprise customers. We define Enterprise customers as distinct business units who have\nbeen engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers, or strategic partners. We assess our performance with\nEnterprise customers by measuring our net dollar expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise\ncustomers measures our ability to increase revenue across our existing Enterprise customer base through expansion\nof users and products. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 130% as of\nJanuary 31, 2022, and greater than 130% as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, and Zoom\nWebinars. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of Zoom for Home, a solution designed for\nthe home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible hardware. We also expanded our geographic\nfootprint with Zoom Phone availability to more than 45 countries and territories during fiscal year 2022. Third-\nparty developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for customers\nand developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more developers and\nother third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the ubiquitous\nplatform for communications. We will need to expend additional resources to continue introducing new products,\nfeatures, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the value of our platform with\ntheir own applications.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nIn July 2021, we introduced Zoom Events. Zoom Events provides businesses with a virtual event management solution\nand enables users to manage and host all types of internal and external virtual events. This includes the ability\nto create a “hub” where all of a business’ events can be listed with corresponding information about each\nexperience. It also enables event hosts to provide ticketing and registration for attendees, and the ability to\ntrack these activities.\nInternational Expansion\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 33%, 31%, and 19% of our total revenue\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in\nfurther select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in certain\ninternational markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for our\nplatform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\n46\nTable of Contents\nKey Business Metrics\nWe have historically reviewed the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends,\nformulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\nCustomers with More Than 10 Employees\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our\ncustomer base, which includes organizations of all sizes across industries. We define a customer as a separate and\ndistinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size (including a distinct unit\nof an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. To better distinguish business customers from our broader\ncustomer base, we review the number of customers with more than 10 employees. As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and\n2020, we had approximately 509,800, 467,100, and 81,900 customers, respectively, with more than 10 employees. When\ndisclosing the number of customers, we round down to the nearest hundred.\nAs we approach our three-year anniversary as a public company, our business has evolved substantially and the\nmetrics that management uses to evaluate the business have changed. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year\n2023, we will no longer present the number of customers with more than 10 employees. However, we will still provide\nthis metric through the end of fiscal year 2023 in the appendix to the investor deck that we will continue to post\non our investor relations website each quarter at investors.zoom.us.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 22%, 20%, and 33% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021,\nand 2020, respectively. As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had 2,725, 1,644, and 641 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid\npenetration of larger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of the customers with more\nthan 10 employees.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of Enterprise customers is an indicator of our potential future\nbusiness opportunities, the growth of our business, and an indicator of our market penetration. Increasing\nawareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of our technology, has expanded\nthe diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, we\nexpect Enterprise customers to represent a larger share of our business. As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we\nhad approximately 191,000, 141,100, and 54,600 Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) and adjusted\nfree cash flow (“Adjusted FCF”), non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We define\nAdjusted FCF as FCF plus litigation settlement payments, net. We add back litigation settlement payments, net\nbecause they are not part of our ongoing operating activities, and the consideration of measures that exclude such\npayments can assist in the comparison of cash generated from operations in different periods which may or may not\ninclude such payments and assist in the comparison with the results of other companies in the industry. We believe\nthat FCF and Adjusted FCF are useful indicators of liquidity that provides information to management and investors\nabout the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be\nused for future growth. FCF and Adjusted FCF are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\nother GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that\nother companies, including companies in our industry, may not use these metrics, may calculate these metrics\ndifferently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the\nusefulness of these non-GAAP metrics as a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nand Adjusted FCF to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP:\n47\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022             2021           2020\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,605,266    $   1,471,177    $   151,892\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -132,590          -79,972        -38,084\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,472,676    $   1,391,205    $   113,808\nAdd: Litigation settlement payments, net                       85,000                —              —\nAdjusted free cash flow (non-GAAP)          $               1,557,676    $   1,391,205    $   113,808\nNet cash used in investing activities       $              -2,859,097    $  -1,562,420    $  -499,468\nNet cash provided by financing              $                  34,068    $   2,050,277    $   615,690\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications\nplatform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also provide\nservices, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are generally\nconsidered distinct from the access to our unified communications platform.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, third-\nparty cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized\nsoftware development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost\nof revenue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, as we expand our data center capacity due to\nincreased usage over time. However, the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may decrease over time as we\nscale our data centers to accommodate usage from our increased customer base and as the ratio of free to paid users\nvaries.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research\nand development for the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing research and development headcount, as we focus\non further developing our platform, enhancing its use cases, and strengthening security and privacy. As a result,\nwe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year. We\nexpect, however, that our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively flat\nduring the upcoming fiscal year.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs. We plan to increase our investment in sales and\nmarketing over the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing the headcount of our direct sales force and\nmarketing investments in demand generation. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in\nabsolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year. We expect, however, that our sales and marketing expenses as a\npercentage of revenue will remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; indirect taxes; litigation settlements, and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the\nsize of our general and administrative function to support the growth and complexity of our business. As a result,\nwe expect our general and\n48\nTable of Contents\nadministrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year. We expect, however, that\nour general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively flat during the upcoming\nfiscal year.\nGains on Strategic Investments, Net\nGains on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity investments.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable securities\nand effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n(Benefit from) provision for Income Taxes\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign\njurisdictions where we conduct business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth

This increase in usage resulted in an increase of $83.5\nmillion in costs related to third-party cloud hosting, our co-located data centers, and integrated third-party PSTN\nservices to support the increase in customers and expanded use of our unified communications platform by existing\ncustomers. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of $99.0 million in personnel-related expenses\nmainly driven by additional headcount, which includes a $34.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense;\nan increase of $26.6 million related to subscription to software-based services; an increase of $9.3 million in\nallocated overhead expenses; and an increase of $8.6 million in professional services mainly for customer support.\nGross margin increased to 74% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 from 69% for the fiscal year ended January\n31, 2021. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to increased efficiencies as we expanded our data center\ncapacity to accommodate the increased usage as well as lower rates from third-party cloud hosting providers.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022          2021       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nResearch and development    $                            362,990    $  164,080    $   198,910         121  %\nResearch and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 increased by $198.9 million, or 121%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related\nexpenses of $182.1 million mainly driven by additional headcount, which includes a $62.8 million increase in stock-\nbased compensation expense. The remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $11.6\nmillion in allocated overhead expenses, and an increase of $6.8 million related to subscription to software-based\nservices.\n51\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022          2021       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nSales and marketing    $                          1,135,959    $  684,904    $   451,055          66  %\nSales and marketing expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 increased by $451.1 million, or 66%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

The change in income taxes was primarily\ndue to the valuation allowance release on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. See Note 10 “Income\nTaxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more details on\nthe valuation allowance release.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $5.4 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be\nsufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We\nbelieve we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash\nflows from operating activities and available cash balances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many\nfactors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent\nof spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses\nassociated with our international expansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest\nin existing and new office spaces as well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into\narrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual\nproperty rights. We may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $         117,763    $                 24,490    $   47,787    $  30,171    $     15,315\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         386,594                     227,182       159,412            —               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         504,357    $                251,672    $  207,199    $  30,171    $     15,315\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,605.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, compared\nto $1,471.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an\nincrease in net income of $703.3 million, offset by the negative impact from changes in operating assets and\nliabilities of $506.3 million, and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $62.9 million, which is primarily a result\nof the income tax benefit from release of valuation allowance and higher gains from strategic investments, offset\nby higher stock-based compensation expense, higher deferred contract acquisition cost amortization due to an\nincrease in capitalized commissions as we continue to grow and expand our customer base, and higher provision for\naccounts receivable allowances due to higher accounts receivable balances.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $2,859.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $2,404.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $305.1\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $132.6 million, purchases of intangible assets of $13.0 million,\nand cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $3.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,562.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $1,438.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $80.0\nmillion, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $26.5 million, purchases of strategic investments of\n$13.0 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $5.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $34.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was due to\nproceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $59.3 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14.4 million, offset by proceeds from international employee stock\nsales remitted to employees and tax authorities of $40.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2,050.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was due to\nproceeds from our follow-on offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, of\n$1,979.2 million , proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our ESPP of $38.4 million, proceeds from the\nexercise of stock options of $28.6 million, and proceeds from international employee stock sales to be remitted to\nemployees and tax authorities of $4.1 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 , please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A\ncommon, which expires in February 2024. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected from time to time,\neither on the open market (including pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other\ntransactions in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe timing and the amount of any repurchased Class A common stock will be determined by our management based on its\nevaluation of market conditions and other factors, and the repurchase program will be funded using our working\ncapital. T he program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAs of March 6, 2022, $997.1 million of the repurchase authorization remained available.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and\nSignificant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following critical estimates involve\na greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We apply judgment during the\nidentification of a contract to determine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of\nfactors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and\nfinancial information pertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to\nwhich we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is\nincluded in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of\ncumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications platform and related\nsignificant features. We do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for expected credit losses for outstanding\naccounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical write-off experience, an analysis of\nthe aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the establishment of specific reserves for\ncustomers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our expectations of changes in macroeconomic\nconditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables, including noncurrent accounts receivable.\nWe also consider current market conditions and reasonable\n55\nTable of Contents\nand supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess\nthe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each reporting period.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan Valuation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense related to our ESPP purchase rights based on the estimated grant\ndate fair value, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the aggregate number of\nshares of our common stock expected to be purchased under each offering. The assumptions used to determine the fair\nvalue of the ESPP purchase rights, including the expected term of the awards, the expected volatility of the price\nof our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, represent\nmanagement’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s\njudgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each\nESPP offering period, which is generally two years. We account for modifications to employee contributions as they\noccur.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions. If factors change\nand different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for the\ncurrent period and in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the awards was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of the ESPP represents the period of time that purchase rights are expected to\nbe outstanding.\nExpected Volatility. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as we\nhave a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average\nhistoric price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in our industry which are\neither similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term\nof the awards. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, expected\nvolatility was determined using a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock and\nhistorical volatility of our stock price.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\n56\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Investments\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment evaluates key factors including but not\nlimited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which\nthe investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair\nvalue by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying\nvalue for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent\nin enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2022 would not have had\na material impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K."

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a small amount\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in\nwhich we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, China, Europe, and Australia. Our\nresults of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates\napplicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has\nnot been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions,\nbut we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $4.4 billion as of January 31, 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our\n57\nTable of Contents\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and other debt\nsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate\nrisk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without\nsignificantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not\nused any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature\nof our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to\nchanges in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would\nnot have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n58\nTable of Contents"

We also have audited the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n60\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,099\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2022.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

Policies\nDescription of Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nconnect people through our core unified communications offering, which frictionlessly brings together video, phone,\nchat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences across disparate devices and locations. We were incorporated\nin the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2022, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2022.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, the useful lives of\nlong-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, stock-based compensation expense, sales and\nother tax liabilities, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the\nvaluation of deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results\ncould materially differ from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions,\nand the extent of its impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments,\nincluding the duration and spread of the outbreak, the availability and distribution of vaccines, and their impact\non our customers and our sales cycles. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, our estimates and\nassumptions required increased judgment and carried a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events\ncontinue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future\nperiods.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2022 or 2021. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 10.2million and $ 50.5million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the\n68\nTable of Contents\namount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding amount is\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2022            31, 2021\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        444,369    $        331,547\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -17,000             -20,500\nLess: Allowance for returns                    -7,696             -16,344\nAccounts receivable, net             $        419,673    $        294,703\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, our assessment considered business and market disruptions caused by\nCOVID-19 and estimates of credit and collectibility trends. The continued volatility in market conditions and\nevolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict, causing variability and volatility that may have a\nmaterial impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Below is a rollforward of our allowance for\ncredit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nJanuary 31, 2022       January 31, 2021\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            20,500    $             5,150\nProvision for credit losses                     32,587                 25,651\nWrite-offs                                     -36,087                -10,301\nBalance as of end of year          $            17,000    $            20,500\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n69\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through gains on strategic investments,\nnet in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments. Privately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured\nat cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in\ngains on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment. As of January 31, 2022, we have not recognized any impairments to our privately held\ndebt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications platform during the application\ndevelopment stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform\nthe function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net.\nCosts related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful\nlife, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of\noperations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of\n70\nTable of Contents\nthese assets. We have capitalized $ 20.2million, $ 19.4million, and $ 3.1million of software development costs\nduring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present\nvalue of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as our leases generally do not\nprovide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a\ncollateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or\nchange in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance leases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2022 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense of developed technology is recorded within cost of\nrevenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n71\nTable of Contents\nWe routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events\nor changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. There\nwere no impairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue\nrecognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications platform, which consists of one or more software-based services. Our customers do not\nhave the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we provide a series of\ndistinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a professional\nmanner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service-level\ncommitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those\ncustomers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form\nof variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n72\nTable of Contents\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications platform and\nrelated services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 2% of total revenue during the periods presented.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located data center costs,\nthird-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of\ncapitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead\ncosts. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related depreciation, health care benefits,\ntraining, and other employee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses based on applicable\nheadcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications platform,\ndepreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 40.9million, $\n34.8million, and $ 42.0million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), RSUs, and ESPP) is measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nfair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of\nour common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSA and RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant\ndate.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Foreign currency related gains and\nlosses have been immaterial during the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future\n73\nTable of Contents\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies,\ncarryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax\nliability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options and RSAs, to be participating securities as holders of\nsuch securities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of\ncommon stock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating\ndecision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below. The following\ntable presents our property and equipment, net of depreciation and amortization, by geographic region:\nAs of January 31,\n2022\n(in thousands)          2021\nAmericas                             $            180,033    $  138,093\nAPAC                                               36,715        10,033\nEMEA                                                5,606         1,798\nTotal property and equipment, net    $            222,354    $  149,924\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is\npermitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n74\nTable of Contents\n2.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 59.7million and $ 24.6million as of January 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 858.2million, $ 222.0million, and $\n119.1million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n2,647.6million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,179.9million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 1,467.7million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 63%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit.

As of January 31, 2022, the fair value of the investment was $\n101.3million and our ownership interest represents approximately onepercent of the economic interest of the\ninvestee’s outstanding capital stock.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made an additional strategic investment in equity securities of a\nprivate company. Based on the terms of these privately-held securities, we determined that we currently do not have\na controlling interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial\npolicies of the investee. Therefore this investment is currently accounted for under the equity method. The fair\nvalue of the investment was remeasured immediately before adopting the equity method of accounting, based on the\nobservable price from the most recent financing round. The carrying value of this investment was also adjusted by\nour share of the equity method investee’s operating result for the respective period, which was immaterial for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2022. As a result, we recognized a total gain of $ 49.9million on the existing\ninvestment during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. As of January 31, 2022, the carrying amount of this\ninvestment was $ 93.4million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made a $ 100.0million strategic investment of common shares of a\nsoftware company in a private placement concurrent with the investee company’s merger. We recorded a loss of $\n32.5million related to this investment for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of the investment was $ 67.5million and our ownership interest represents approximately twopercent of the\neconomic interest of the investee’s outstanding capital stock.\n77\nTable of Contents\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we also made a $ 75.0million strategic investment in equity securities\nof a private company. Based on the terms of these privately-held securities, we determined that we do not have a\ncontrolling interest nor the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of\nthe investee.

We classify our commercial\npaper, agency bonds, corporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills, and\ncertificates of deposit within Level 2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted prices that are\ndirectly or indirectly observable in the market, including readily available pricing sources for the identical\nunderlying security, which may not be actively traded. We classify our privately held debt securities as Level 3\ndue to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, such as the probability weighting of the\nvarious scenarios that can impact settlement of the arrangement.\n5. Business Combinations\nOn May 7, 2020, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Keybase, Inc. (“Keybase”), a secure\nmessaging and file-sharing company, for purchase consideration of $ 42.9million in cash. The acquisition helps us\nstrengthen the security of our unified communications platform by providing end-to-end encryption expertise. The\nacquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 24.3million was attributed to goodwill, $ 3.3million to intangible\nassets, and $ 15.3million to other net assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $\n16.4million. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing products expected to be realized from\nthe acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquired\nintangible assets consisted of developed technology with an estimated useful life of five years. The developed\ntechnology had a remaining useful life of 3.3years as of January 31, 2022, and is amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over its estimated useful life.\nNot included in the purchase consideration, we also entered into holdback agreements with certain employees for $\n20.0million in cash payments, which are subject to such employees’ continued service with us. The holdback amount\nof $ 20.0million will be treated as compensation for research and development over the required service period\nranging from one yearto three years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto 8years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our HaaS offering. As a practical\nexpedient, we account for HaaS with customers as a combined performance obligation with the right to access our\nunified communications platform under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our\nconsolidated financial statements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach\nmaturity, we consider various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist\nto determine whether we are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 22.8million, $ 14.5million and $ 9.7million ,\nrespectively, excluding short-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was\nimmaterial for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 .\n81\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n2022\nReported as:                                 (in thousands, except life and\nAssets:                                                        percentages)                     2021\nOperating lease right-of-use         $                               95,965               $   97,649\nassets\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other\ncurrent                              $                               20,697               $   15,601\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities,                                         85,018                   90,415\nnoncurrent\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                              105,715               $  106,016\nWeighted average remaining lease                                             5.1 years                6.1 years\nterm\nWeighted average discount rate                                          4.0  %                   4.5  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022         2021         2020\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  22,679    $  13,717    $   9,774\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  16,784    $  39,918    $  34,993\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2022, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2022\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2023                                 $                  24,491\n2024                                                    24,234\n2025                                                    23,552\n2026                                                    18,467\n2027                                                    11,704\nThereafter                                              15,315\nTotal operating lease payments       $                 117,763\nLess: imputed interest                                 -12,048\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                 105,715\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2022, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 227.2million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 159.4million.\n82\nTable of Contents\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 87.2million and $ 85.6million, respectively, of which $ 33.3million and $\n27.5million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 53.9million and $\n58.1million are included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based\non our best estimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of\na probable outcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue\nsubject to sales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant\nadjustments to the sales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements for changes to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in\nthe future as we obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nOther Contingencies\nIn June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to\nthe Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and\ninformation relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our\nstatements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition,\nthe NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the\nChinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies,\nprocedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional\nsubpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations\nand have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not\nknow when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or\nwhat actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a\nnegative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other\nfinancial exposure.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our\nofficers in the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of the\nCompany. The complaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about\nour data privacy and security measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May\n18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23,\n2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on\nMay 20, 2021. Plaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the\nmotion to dismiss was filed on August 9, 2021. On February 16, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our\nmotion to dismiss.\n83\nTable of Contents\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is\nstayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On October 27, 2021, a third\nsubstantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated and\nstayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action.\nWe believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the\nuncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among\nother things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss that may result from these actions.\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in various U.S. federal district\ncourts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with\nthird parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state consumer\nprotection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims, such as negligence and\nunjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs seek various forms of injunctive and\nmonetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\nfederal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the NDCA with our consent; lead plaintiffs’ counsel have\nbeen appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint on October 28, 2020.\nOn March 11, 2021, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss, and gave plaintiffs leave\nto amend. On July 30, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs to settle the action on a\nclasswide basis, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the court on July\n31, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the court preliminarily approved the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement,\nwe have paid $ 85.0million into an escrow account that will be used to pay claims filed by settlement class\nmembers, attorneys’ fees and expenses, administrative costs, and service payments to plaintiffs. The Court has\nscheduled a final approval hearing to take place on April 7, 2022. We recorded an aggregate legal settlement charge\nof $ 66.9million net of amounts estimated to be covered by insurance as a general and administrative expense in our\nconsolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nOn January 19, 2021, we finalized a settlement agreement with the FTC which requires us to implement certain\ninjunctive provisions, including, among other things, refraining from making any misrepresentations regarding the\nprivacy and security of our services or how we collect, maintain, use, delete, disclose, allow access to, and\nprotect user information. It also requires us to implement a detailed information security program and obtain\nthird-party security assessments periodically. We do not expect the settlement to have a material impact on our\nfinancial results. We are cooperating with the FTC’s requirements and working to ensure compliance.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n9. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nUpon completion of the IPO in April 2019, all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding, totaling\n152,665,804shares, were automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock on a\none-to-one basis and their carrying value of $ 159.6million was reclassified into stockholders’ equity. As of\nJanuary 31, 2022 and 2021, there were noshares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nIn connection with the IPO, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which\nauthorized the issuance of 200,000,000shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001with rights\nand preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors.\n84\nTable of Contents\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that is authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nEquity Financing\nOn April 23, 2019, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 9,911,434shares of our Class A common stock at\n$ 36.00per share. On April 18, 2019, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional\n3,130,435shares of our Class A common stock at $ 36.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 447.9million,\nnet of underwriters’ discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO:\nall of the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of\n152,665,804shares of Class B common stock;\noutstanding convertible promissory notes and accrued interest automatically converted into 426,223shares of Class\nA common stock based on the IPO price of $ 36.00per share; and\nSalesforce Ventures LLC purchased 2,777,777shares of Class A common stock from us at $ 36.00per share in a\nconcurrent private placement. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 100.0million and did not pay any underwriting\ndiscounts or commissions with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in this private\nplacement.\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees related to our IPO. Prior to the\nIPO, all deferred offering costs were capitalized in other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAfter the IPO, $ 6.4million of deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders’ equity (deficit) as a\nreduction of the IPO proceeds in the consolidated balance sheets. We capitalized $ 2.4million of deferred offering\ncosts within other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, which were\nreclassified into additional paid-in capital upon the completion of the IPO.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 5,882,353shares of our\nClass A common stock, including 735,294shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase\nadditional shares, at $ 340.00per share.

In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time.

The weighted-average grant date\nfair value of options granted to employees during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was $ 25.17. The intrinsic\nvalue of the options exercised, which represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock\non the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option, was $ 843.0million, $ 1,786.7million, and $\n767.3million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of January 31, 2022,\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense\n86\nTable of Contents\nrelated to outstanding unvested stock options was $ 19.7million, which is expected to be recognized over a\nweighted-average period of 0.8years.\nThe Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options at the grant dates are as follows:\nYear Ended January 31, 2020\nExpected term (years)      5.0-6.1\nExpected volatility        49.9% -53.2%\nRisk-free interest rate    1.6% -2.5%\nExpected dividend yield    —\nThese assumptions and estimates were determined as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input\nfrom management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation specialists. Stock-based compensation for\nfinancial reporting purposes is measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as when\nadditional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available in a valuation report issued as of a\nsubsequent date. After our initial public offering, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock was\nbased on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the grant.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be\noutstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to\nestimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the\nexpected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of\nthe time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock options. For stock options granted to nonemployees, the\nexpected term equals the contractual term of the stock option.\nExpected Volatility. As we have a short trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was\nestimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public\ncompanies in our industry that are similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period\nequivalent to the expected term of the awards.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of RSU activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nRSUs\nUnvested                      Weighted-Average\nRSUs       Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nUnvested as of January 31, 2021     4,510,730    $                           194.57\nGranted                             3,195,949    $                           265.12\nVested                             -1,768,702    $                           190.36\nCanceled/forfeited                   -391,611    $                           250.92\nUnvested as of January 31, 2022     5,546,366    $                           232.58\nIn October 2021, we added a feature to new and existing stock awards that provides employees with additional awards\nbased on certain stock price criteria. The value of the modified RSUs began to be recognized as compensation\nexpense in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 and will continue to be recognized through the remaining\nrequisite service period for the RSUs. This had an immaterial impact on our consolidated statement of operations\nfor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nAs of January 31, 2022, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested RSUs was $\n1,437.2million, including the impact of the modification, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 2.8years.\n87\nTable of Contents\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 ESPP, which became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019.

We continued to record a valuation allowance through the first nine months\nof fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, management concluded that the valuation allowance related to\nthe U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer needed primarily due to its assessment of income/loss\nin recent periods and the forecast of future taxable income. As of January 31, 2022, based on evaluation of all\npositive and negative evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets\nwill be realized for U.S. federal and state purposes. Accordingly, management has recognized a non-recurring tax\nbenefit of $ 328.0million related to the valuation allowance reversal. As of January 31, 2022, we continued to\nmaintain a valuation allowance of $ 12.6million related to net deferred tax assets of our U.K. subsidiary and will\nmaintain this valuation allowance until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or a portion of\nthe valuation allowance.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 122.3million for state income\ntax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if unused. We also had certain foreign net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $ 44.2million, which have an indefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 18.4million\nfor state income tax purposes. The state research and development tax credits carry forward indefinitely.\nThe state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section\n383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. Such provisions limit the net\noperating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences, including\nsignificant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382 review and determined that none of our operating\nlosses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n90\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2022         2021        2020\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  14,884    $   8,106    $  2,778\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                     —          314           —\nGross decreases                                                -3,764            —           —\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                 8,211        6,001       5,328\nGross decreases                                                     —            —           —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                  -160         -422           —\nAcquisitions                                                        —          885           —\nBalance, end of year                        $                  19,171    $  14,884    $  8,106\nAs of January 31, 2022, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 19.2million ($\n19.6million total, including $ 0.4million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2021, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 14.9million ($ 15.0million total, including $\n0.1million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2020, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 8.1million ($ 8.4million total, including $ 0.3million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 0.4million, $ 0.1million, and $ 0.3million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2022, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nOn March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“American Rescue Plan Act”) was passed into law and\namended portions of relevant tax laws. The American Rescue Plan Act did not have a significant impact on the\nprovision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\n91\nTable of Contents\n11.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2022 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2022 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected."

BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables people to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications and collaboration platform started with video as its foundation, and\nwe have set the standard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice\nfor large enterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We provide a unified communications and\ncollaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact, connecting them\nthrough frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. Our Developer Platform enables\ncustomers, developers, and service providers to easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-\nleading video communications and collaboration platform, with opportunities for global discovery and distribution.\nOur virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to seamlessly create and manage engaging events.\nOur cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice solutions that are easy to use, manage,\nand deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; and is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces\nand applications. As businesses around the world navigate a period of significant work transformation, Zoom’s\nability to enable meaningful connections whether teams are in the office, at home, on-the-go, or in other locations\nsuch as a retail or manufacturing setting, is a critical differentiator. We believe that rich and reliable\ncommunications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution that is secure, reliable, and “just works.”\nA cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features\ndesigned to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users comprise both\nhosts, who organize video meetings, and individual attendees, who participate in those video meetings. In 2019, we\nlaunched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications and collaboration platform.\nMany customers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users\nto easily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces.\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, during fiscal year 2023\nwe announced Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for video and integrated\nright into the same Zoom experience as well as Zoom Whiteboard, a persistent whiteboard tool for team collaboration\nin and outside of meetings and Zoom IQ for Sales, a conversation intelligence software for Zoom Meetings, which\nprovides sales teams with meaningful and actionable insights from their customer interactions to improve seller\nperformance and enhance customer experiences. As of February 2023, Zoom Mail and Calendar are generally available,\nwhich include both client experiences (Zoom Mail Client, Zoom Calendar Client) and service components (Zoom Mail\nService, Zoom Calendar Service). Lastly, we launched Zoom Virtual Agent, an AI-powered chatbot that understands\ncustomer questions and provides accurate answers quickly.\nThe happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites,\nincluding Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2022 Gartner Peer\nInsights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions as well as for Zoom Rooms and Zoom Video Webinars and a\nTrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software award along with nine other recognitions. Industry analysts also\nrecognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a leader in the Magic Quadrant for UCaaS for the third year\nin a row. Frost & Sullivan recognized Zoom with its 2022 North American Virtual Care Customer Value Leadership\nAward as well as its 2022 Global SMB Customer Experience Customer Value Leadership Award. In 2022, we were also\nrecognized as a leader in two IDC MarketScapes for Collaboration Tools in Education (North America and Worldwide).\nIn addition, IDC recognized Zoom as a leader in the 2022 APAC Team Collaboration and Videoconferencing MarketScape.\nZoom also received Leader recognition in two Aragon Research Globes: Unified Communications and Collaboration as\nwell as Video Conferencing. We also received Aragon’s Innovation Award for Video Conferencing for the third year in\na row (2020, 2021 and 2022). Zoom was also named to Fortune’s 2023 Most Admired Companies list for the second year\nin a row, and Fast Company’s 2022 Next Big Things in Tech list highlighted Zoom Events.\nWe have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy\nfor optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience the simplicity and reliability of\nour platform – it “gets out of the way” so they can focus on what they need to get done together. This enthusiasm\ncontinues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales\nefforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer opportunity, which can\ninclude our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that\ndelights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these\npractices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our\nexisting customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nhosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the Zoom\ndifference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates\nthe viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales representatives, online\nchannel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively drive upgrades to our paid\noffering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, phone, and contact center for a\ncomplete and integrated set of communications services.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication and\ncollaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of\nengineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base.\nDrive international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world, we\nare poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal.

We\ndesigned our communications and collaboration platform to address the most difficult component of communications:\nvideo. Video requires intense computing resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, as\nwell as higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like\nvoice, chat, and content sharing. Our architecture separates video content processing from the transporting and\nmixing of streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that reside on client devices and\ndynamically encode and decode based upon the performance of client technology, network performance, and bandwidth.\nWe leverage a next-generation multimedia router that operates on commodity hardware and a globally distributed\ncloud infrastructure to determine the optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect\nthe participants.\nOur Customers\nWe have customers of all sizes, from individuals to global Fortune 50 organizations. Our current customer base\nspans numerous industry categories, including education, entertainment/media, enterprise infrastructure, finance,\ngovernment, health care, manufacturing, nonprofit/not for profit and social impact, retail/consumer products, and\nsoftware/internet. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2023.\nSales\nOur sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meetings plan with a sales approach\noptimized for the size of each customer opportunity. Our direct sales force includes our field sales\nrepresentatives as well as our inside sales team, and it is organized by customer subscription size, region, and\nvertical. Our channel team coordinates the activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong\necosystem that broadens our reach. Our online channel supports high-volume, high-velocity, self-service sales.\n10\nTable of Contents\nMarketing\nOur marketing team’s primary objective is to create preference for our brand by leveraging our viral growth,\nenhancing brand perception, and engaging our users with virtual events, content, social media, and customer\nadvisory councils. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out-of-home advertising. We shifted our\nevents strategy from in-person to online and then to hybrid as the world came out the pandemic, including hosting\nZoomtopia, our annual user conference, as hybrid experience featuring both in person and virtual events to tens of\nthousands of attendees.\nResearch and Development\nWe drive our business with constant innovation. We have research and development presence in China, India,\nSingapore and the United States, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to invest more in\nincreasing our product capabilities in an efficient manner with a “follow the sun” strategy.\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and GoTo, bundled productivity solution providers with video functionality,\nincluding Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams, and UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including 8x8, Avaya, and\nRingCentral, as well as consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including\nAmazon, Apple, and Facebook. Additionally, as we build out Zoom Contact Center, we may face additional competition,\nincluding from Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact.\nWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:\nvideo-first platform;\ncloud-native architecture;\nfunctionality and scalability;\nease of use and reliability;\nbrand awareness and preference;\nability to utilize existing infrastructure, such as legacy conference room hardware; and\nlow total cost of ownership.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections,\nto establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions\noriginating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the\nUnited States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and\nexternal controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. This may\ninclude open source software. We take steps to ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses governing such\nlicensed technology. We believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark,\ncopyright, trade secret, license, or other intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated\nwith our intellectual property, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on\nour capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nNevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those\npertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material\nimpact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government\nregulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\n11\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 31, 2023, we had 8,484 full-time employees. Of these employees, 4,588 are in the United States and\n3,896 are in our international locations. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Employees in\none of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefit of a collective bargaining agreement and are represented by a\nworkers’ council. We have not experienced interruptions of operations or any work stoppages due to labor\ndisagreements.\nOur Culture of Happiness\nWe are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We strive to change the way business is done\nthrough our communications technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we have an\nemployee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify our efforts to deliver happiness to our\nemployees and customers.\nOur culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision, and values and is fundamental to everything we do\nat Zoom:\nMission. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nVision. Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video communications.\nValues. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves.\nThis culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent. Zoom\nwas prominently featured in the computer software category on Fortune’s ‘Most Admired Companies’ list.\nAdditionally, it was named to the Variety500, an award that recognizes the most influential business leaders\nshaping the industry. Zoom was also named to Newsweek’s “America's Greatest Workplaces 2023 for Diversity” list.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) at Zoom is an embodiment of our core value of Care. DEI also represents\nour intentional effort to create an inclusive environment of the brightest minds from a broad set of backgrounds in\norder to create the most innovative solutions for our customers. Our approach to DEI is driven across four\nstrategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how\nwe include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).\nWe have taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College,\nAnitaB.org, and a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, our Zoom Talks\ninitiative creates ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about one another’s unique backgrounds. We have a\nnumber of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women, Asian and Pacific Islander,\nVeteran, and LGBTQ+ communities. Our ERGs offer our employees support and community building opportunities, and\nhelp to foster an inclusive environment and diverse workplace. Our DEI Team continues to partner with teams leading\nour product design and marketing to invest in making our products even more inclusive and accessible to the diverse\nset of communities we serve.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. Our employees’\ntotal compensation packages include base pay, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nOver the past several years, we conducted a comprehensive employee survey with regular follow-ups and engaged in\npeer research to make thoughtful decisions on how to move forward in an evolving world of work. Two priorities were\nimmediately clear: keeping our employees safe and supporting them through a meaningful employee experience. We\nbelieve maintaining a flexible working environment for our employees is a key priority. We offer three “workstyles”\nfor our employees (in-person, remote and hybrid) and will be allow most employees to choose their own workstyle.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2011 under the name Saasbee, Inc., and in\nFebruary 2012, we changed our name to Zoom Communications, Inc.

                "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and upsell additional products and new product\ncategories to existing customers, and upgrade free hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers,\nrenewals, or upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers, and maintain and expand our relationships with our\nexisting customers, including upselling additional products and new product categories to our existing customers\nand upgrading hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts\nwho subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.”\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers\nwill renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,\nor purchase additional products, if they renew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or\nfluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no\nlonger having a need for our products, including any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic that may subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic\nhave tapered, a reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending\nbudgets on our competitors' platforms, during periods of high inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic\nenvironments or the perception that competitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In\naddition, some customers downgrade their Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the increased usage of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted largely\nfrom businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could result\nin higher non-renewal rates than we have experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and hosts\nto grow our business beyond our current user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to continue to\nuse our platform. Finally, any decrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand,\nword-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by\nrecommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand\nwithin organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\nour platform into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we encourage hosts that\nsubscribe to our free Zoom\n13\nTable of Contents\nMeeting plan to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including those that\ninitially subscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and work-from-\nhome mandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts\nof our free Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within organizations, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nIn addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase. If we\nare not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline. While\nwe continue to add paid users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or decline\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, particularly as users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer\nsubject to limitations on in-person meetings.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and may decline in future periods.\nOur revenue growth has fluctuated in prior periods. We have previously experienced periods of significant revenue\ngrowth. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our\nfuture performance. Our revenue growth rate over the past year has stabilized but there are no assurances we will\nbe able to sustain or increase it in future periods, and our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods.\nMany factors may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher market penetration, increased\ncompetition, macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary or uncertain environments and\nfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, slowing demand for our platform, especially during the COVID-19\npandemic recovery, which has led to users returning to work or school or are otherwise no longer being subject to\nlimitations on in-person meetings, a lower than anticipated capitalization on growth opportunities, and the\nmaturation of our business, among others. Our growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our\nbusiness and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors, would\nimpair the delivery of our services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers.\nDamage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in\ninterruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, other\ninterruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to,\ninfrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber\nextortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage, local administrative actions, changes to\nlegal or permitting requirements, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify\nthe cause or causes of these problems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial\noutages in our services that impacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in\nconnection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center\nfacilities or other reasons, we may move or transfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not\nincluding our China data center. Despite precautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data\ntransfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in\nconnection with any such move or transfer. Interruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our\nrevenue; may require us to issue credits or pay penalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause\ncustomers and hosts to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and\nhosts. Our ability to attract and retain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide customers and hosts\nwith a highly reliable platform and even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, customers may\nexperience delays or interruptions in service as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could result in the\nloss of customers who use our unified communications and collaboration platform because of its reliability and\nperformance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers throughout the world to meet increased\ndemand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner, including as a result of\ncurrent shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term capacity needs, we may need\nto rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud, which may result in\nhigher variable costs, harming our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and other public health related measures, any\nof which could disrupt our service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it\nmay take a significant period of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning\nmay not account for all eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these\n14\nTable of Contents\nfacilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to\nclose the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our\nbusiness.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain\nfeatures of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products\noffered by:\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services into our platform, and with the introduction of new technologies and market\nentrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.\nIn February 2022, we launched Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for\nvideo, which, as we build out our offering, may result in increased competition against companies that offer\nsimilar services, such as Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact, and new competitors that may enter that market\nin the future. As we continue to build out our platform, we may face increased competition against companies that\noffer similar services and new competitors that may enter that market in the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from smaller customers, many of whom are consumers or\nsmall and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller customers, we face competition from more consumer-\noriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the consumer market than we do. Further, many of our\nactual and potential competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition;\nlonger operating histories; more varied products and services; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing\nrelationships; more third-party integration; greater accessibility across devices or applications; greater access\nto larger user bases; major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater\nfinancial, technical, and other resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or strategic investments\nor enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and services than we do, which may\nprevent us from using such third parties' technology or offering such products or services. These combinations may\nmake it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to\nstrengthen or maintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nforced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on\noccasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in\ndeferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts\nreceivable.\nOur results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or\nperiod should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our results of operations may fluctuate as\na result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect\nthe underlying performance of our business. For example, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in\nusage of our unified communications and collaboration platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant\nportion of which was attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased\ndemand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our\ninfrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on\npublic cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in our results may negatively impact the\n15\nTable of Contents\nvalue of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our results of operations include, without\nlimitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our\npaid Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles and linearity of our bookings, especially with respect to sales to large\nenterprises and highly regulated industries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign\ngovernmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases; and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service; network outages; or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits, regulatory actions or investigations; legislator scrutiny; or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer or\nbusiness spending.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy, such as high inflation, recessionary or uncertain\nenvironments, fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates and global impacts, including the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine and the United States' ongoing trade disputes with China and other countries. Some customers\nmay view a subscription to our platform as a cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others\nmay view a subscription to our platform as a discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their information\ntechnology spending on our platform during an economic downturn or during times of economic uncertainty. Given\ncurrent economic conditions, including inflation, we could experience a reduction in demand and loss of customers,\nespecially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact on various industries that\nour unified communications and collaboration platform addresses. We would lose\n16\nTable of Contents\ncustomers as a result of customers ceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer\npayment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater\ndeployment challenges.\nWe have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a\nsignificant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval\nrequirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face unexpected deployment challenges with\nlarge organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large organizations may demand additional\nfeatures, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional security management or control features.\nWe may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that\nour efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their\norganization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large\norganizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be\nnegatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\na reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending budgets on our\ncompetitors' platforms, during periods of high inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic environments;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and there are no assurances we will be able to maintain or increase\nprofitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend\nsignificant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing efforts to attract new customers and hosts and to\ndevelop and enhance our products and for general corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional\npersonnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses, upgrading our infrastructure, addressing security\nand privacy issues, and expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we are successful in increasing our\nuser base, we may also incur increased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated with\nacquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the subscription revenue is generally\nrecognized ratably over the subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear basis. Our efforts\nto grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our\n17\nTable of Contents\nrevenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in decreased profitability. We may incur\nsignificant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described\nherein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. While free users\ncontinue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing programs focused on converting\nfree users to paid subscriptions. Some of these new hosts using our platform on a free Basic account have upgraded\nto a paid Zoom Meeting plan but the remainder have not and may never do so. If we are unable to increase or sustain\nour profitability, the value of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it\nis difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our platform, user adoption and\nrenewal of our platform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive\nproducts and services. As a result, we may not increase or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to\ngrow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other\nproductivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors\nown, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute\noperating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform\nrequires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and\nservices that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business\npartners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from\ncustomers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and\nproducts; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.\nOur customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest\nsignificantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality\nand ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic user demand for our platform. There is no\nassurance that new additions or other future enhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or\ncapabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If\nour research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand or if we fail to\n18\nTable of Contents\ndevelop our platform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, we may fail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing\nthat could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,\nor capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and\ncapabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released\naccording to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or\nclaims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to\nour platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.\nIf customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not\nperform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,\nlicense, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such\nenhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and\nservices will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan\nto continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are\nunable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to\nacquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our\nefforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our\nnew sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our\nsales and marketing programs are not effective.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users has grown and their\nusage of communications capacity has increased, we have been required to make additional investments in network\ncapacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of\nwhich may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity does not continue to be available to us as our user\nbase grows in the future, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission\ncapacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third parties providing\ninternet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not have access to our\nplatform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new\ntechnologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased\ndemand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential\nusers to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid\nour platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The\norder requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management\npractices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient\nto enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and\nother small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June\n11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to\nthe new rules, but reversed the FCC’s decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband\ninternet service, requiring case-by-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the\nFCC’s rules. The court also required the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to\nremain in effect, while the FCC conducts that review. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that\nthe three issues remanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order.\nPetitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending and could be reversed by the current FCC after Democrats\ngain control. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive\nactions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A federal court judge denied a request for a\npreliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network neutrality law, and as a result, California\nbegan enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. The appeal of that decision and a petition for rehearing were denied in\nJanuary and April 2022, respectively. A number of other states have adopted or are adopting or considering\nlegislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A similar law in Vermont\nis subject to a pending challenge, but went into effect on April 20, 2022. We cannot predict whether the FCC order\nor other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal\nlegislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s new rules, broadband internet access providers may be able to charge web-\nbased services such as ours for priority access or favor services offered by our competitors or by the internet\naccess providers themselves, which could result in increased costs and a loss of existing customers and hosts,\nimpair our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security\nmeasures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,\nexpose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products\nand services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or\nceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely collect, receive, store,\nprocess, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share\nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data, including data of ours, our customers, and our users, the data which\nincludes personal information, customer and user content, health-related data, intellectual property, trade\nsecrets, business plans, and financial information. We and the third parties upon which we rely face a variety of\nevolving threats, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, which could cause security incidents. Security\nincidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information.\nCyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data and\ninformation technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. Cloud-based platform providers\nof products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. Threats are prevalent and continue\nto rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer\n“hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or\nmisuse), sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced persistent threat intrusions.\nSome actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-\nstate actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During\ntimes of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a\nheightened risk of these attacks, including cyberattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations,\nsupply chain, and ability to provide our services. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including\nbut not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses\nand worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks\n(such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware,\ntelecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including\nthose perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are\nbecoming increasingly\n20\nTable of Contents\nprevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income,\nreputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware\nattack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations\nprohibiting such payments. Additionally, our platform, products, and services are relied on by a large number of\ncompanies worldwide and as a result, if our platform, products, or solutions are compromised, a significant number\nor all of our customers and their data could be simultaneously affected. The potential liability and associated\nconsequences we could suffer as a result of such a large-scale event could be catastrophic and result in\nirreparable harm.\nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional\ncybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in\nacquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were\nnot found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate\ncompanies into our information technology environment and security program.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and\nvulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to our business operations. We rely on third-\nparty service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process confidential, proprietary,\nand sensitive data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center\nfacilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, and other\nfunctions. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services, parts, or otherwise\nto operate our business. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and\nthese third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-party service\nproviders experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we\nmay be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related\nobligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award.\nIn addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third\nparties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that\ncould result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration,\nencryption, disclosure of, or access to confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data or our information technology\nsystems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt\nour ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services. We may expend significant\nresources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain\nprivacy, data protection, and information security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific\nsecurity measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology\nsystems and sensitive data.\nIf our security measures are compromised, our reputation could be damaged; our data, information or intellectual\nproperty, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised; our business may be harmed;\nand we could incur significant liability. We take steps to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, but we may not be\nable to detect and remediate all vulnerabilities because the threats and techniques used to exploit the\nvulnerability change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. Therefore, such vulnerabilities could be\nexploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. These vulnerabilities pose material\nrisks to our business. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to\naddress any such identified vulnerabilities. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the\nfuture to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our services or\nsoftware or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems.\nIn addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to\nactively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may\nincrease because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications\nand collaboration platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the\nZoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software\naddressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by\nthese vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and\ntheir software is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security\nresearcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized\nperson to gain root access to a user’s system. Given the nature of our business and operations, our products and\nservices will inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects that have not been identified or\nremediated and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We have identified vulnerabilities in our\nproducts and services in the past, and we expect that we will continue to identify vulnerabilities in the future.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to address any vulnerabilities in our software products\n21\nTable of Contents\nand services that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in developing patches that can be\neffectively deployed to address vulnerabilities.\nWe will continue to make prioritization decisions to determine which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and\nthe timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security. Further, in many cases,\ncustomers are responsible for installing our software updates, and until they do so, their service remains subject\nto the vulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, errors in\nremediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remediate vulnerabilities or\nsecurity defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to install software updates could\nresult in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Security incidents\nand vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security may also cause some\nof our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their subscriptions. Failures\nto meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality of their data and\ninformation could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and hosts, attract new customers\nand hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or security vulnerabilities could result in\nbreaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including class action litigation), regulatory\ninvestigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the effects of such\nan event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in customer, host, and user trust,\nincreases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to address cybersecurity issues,\nand attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and settlements, and attorney fees, and harm\nto our business and our reputation because of any such incident.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving\ncertain types of personal information. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data\nbreach is costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches.\nActual or perceived security compromises experienced in our industry or by our competitors, our customers, a third\nparty upon whom we rely, or us could cause us to experience adverse consequences, such as government enforcement\nactions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements\nand/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class\nclaims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions;\ninterruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security\nincidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our services, deter new customers from using\nour services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nIn addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States, like many similarly situated\ntechnology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel in China, which has exposed\nand could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and media scrutiny regarding the\nactual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.\nIncreased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand could\nlead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our information security and\npotential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened our\nplatform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading to challenges for users who did not have full IT\nsupport or established protocols for security and privacy like our larger customers. As a result, we have\nexperienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and security and privacy issues, including on\nencryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer\nand user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure, additional expenses, and other harm to our\nbusiness.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of\nuse, or other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities\nor damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability\ninsurance coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer\nwill not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that\nare not covered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our\nbusiness.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers, hosts, and\nusers and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications\nand collaboration platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users view the Zoom brand\nprimarily as a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform that connects people through\nvideo, voice, chat and content sharing, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market\nposition may be detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive,\nmaintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or\nperception of our platform, including any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints stemming\nfrom increased usage or of our privacy or security features, or of the providers of communication and collaboration\ntechnologies generally, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain hosts.\nSimilarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or perceived violation by our\nemployees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause us reputational harm and\ncustomer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our business, among other\nthings. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public perception of our platform\nor our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be harmed.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully manage our growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, our employee headcount, both in the United States and internationally, has increased\nsignificantly over time. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous, significant strain on our\nmanagement, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to support our user base, our\nexpanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our internal controls and procedures\nmay not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to grow, we face challenges integrating,\ndeveloping, and motivating our employee base in various countries around the world. Many of our personnel work\nremotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. Certain members of our management have\nnot previously worked together for an extended period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a\npublic company, which may affect how they manage our growth effectively.\nIn addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. In February 2023, we commenced certain restructuring actions (the “Restructuring\nPlan”), designed to reduce operating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. We\nmay encounter challenges in the execution of these efforts, and these challenges could impact our financial\nresults.\nAlthough we believe that the Restructuring Plan will reduce operating costs and improve operating margins, we\ncannot guarantee that the Restructuring Plan will achieve or sustain the targeted benefits, or that the benefits,\neven if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations. As a result of\nthese actions, we will incur additional charges in the near term, including those related to employee transition,\nseverance payments, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation. Additional risks associated with the\ncontinuing impact of the Restructuring Plan include employee attrition beyond our intended reduction in force and\nadverse effects on employee morale (which may also be further exacerbated by actual or perceived declining value of\nequity awards), diversion of management attention, adverse effects to our reputation as an employer (which could\nmake it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future), and potential failure or delays to meet\noperational and growth targets due to the loss of qualified employees. If we do not realize the expected benefits\nof our restructuring efforts on a timely basis or at all, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our historical rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to\nforecast our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to\neffectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future,\nrisks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to\nachieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately\nforecast future growth, our business would be harmed.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. Such changes may result in\na loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to\nwork together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover\nor otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all, which may be exacerbated by our recent restructuring actions and any\nsimilar future actions. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to\naddress a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely\nmanner. In addition, we may experience employee turnover as a result of our recent restructuring actions. New hires\nrequire training and take time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as\nwe expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If we fail to\nattract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. Moreover, as we plan to reopen our offices, vaccine mandates and similar government orders\nand restrictions could result in employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting. We must also continue to retain\nand motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development\nopportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering (“IPO”), employees joining us at\ndifferent times could have significant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business. Further, the volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less\nattractive to current and potential employees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in\nhiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 30%, 33%, and 31% of our\ntotal revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We plan to add local sales\nsupport in further select international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with\nglobal users, and we expect to continue to expand our international operations, which includes opening offices in\nnew jurisdictions and providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational\ncorporations. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell\nsubscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. If we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-\nspecific requirements, we have in the past and may in the future experience service outages or other adverse\nconsequences that would impair our ability to operate in or to expand further into certain markets. For example,\nthe Chinese government has at times turned off our service in China without warning and requested that we take\ncertain steps prior to restoring our service, such as designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests\nand transferring China-based user data housed in the United States to a data center in China. In addition, our\nability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally in the future requires considerable\nmanagement attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing\nbusiness in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative\ndispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international expansion will require investment of significant\nfunds and other resources. We also face risks related to recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees\noutside the United States, including complying with complex employment- and compensation-related laws, regulations,\nand practices in these international jurisdictions, and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices.\nWe may also be unable to grant equity compensation to employees in certain countries outside of the United States\ndue to the complexities of local laws and regulations. This may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives\nto supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash compensation plans or increased short-term cash\ncompensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees in these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and increases risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, and\nunsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our\npractices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United\nStates, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual\nproperty outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n25\nTable of Contents\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”) withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the continuing deterioration in diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and China and the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine, which can and has resulted\nin the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade protection measures, import or export requirements, trade\nembargoes, and other trade barriers;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary environments, and\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, weighing on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a\ntimely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nAs described above, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, European\nUnion, and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus. Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian\nfinancial institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or\nthe SWIFT, payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be\ntaken in future, by the United States, NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could\nresult in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new\nbusiness opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. In addition, legal requirements in the United States and other\ncountries may come into conflict with each other making it challenging or impossible to comply with both countries’\nlegal requirements simultaneously. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal\npenalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and regulations\nor manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in\ncertain foreign jurisdictions.\nGeopolitical tension between the United States and China, or between other countries and China, may intensify and\nlead to increased scrutiny of our business operations in China.\nWe have a significant number of employees, primarily engineers, in China, where personnel costs are less expensive\nthan in many other geographies. The number or proportion of our employees in China has fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including macroeconomic changes and internal restructuring.\nGeopolitical and national security tensions between the United States and China, or between other countries and\nChina, have in the past, currently are and could in the future lead to increased scrutiny of our business\noperations in China.\nIn June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took relating to videoconference commemorations of the\ncrackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. The NDCA subpoena also requested documents and\ninformation about (among other things) contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese\ngovernment, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures,\npractices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We are fully cooperating with these\ninvestigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing,\nand we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the\ninvestigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these\ninvestigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines,\npenalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan\nmust be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers\nand hosts and, consequently, our business.\nIncreased user demand for support, may result in increased costs that may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, during the COVID-19 pandemic we saw surging demand requiring us to allocate additional resources to\nsupport our expanded user base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time.\nIn addition, as we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue\nto provide efficient support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. As the number of our\nusers has grown significantly, it has put additional pressure on our support organization. If we are unable to\nprovide efficient user support globally at scale or if we need to hire additional support personnel, our business\nmay be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and on\nrecommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our business.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor\ntheir products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant\ntime and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to\nscale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and\ntraining. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to\neffectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop\nrelationships with new resellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to\nmanage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of\nnew customers and hosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our\nbusiness.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we have become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nportion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the\ncurrencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, 20.0%, 22.6%, and 20.2% of our revenue, respectively, and 10.8%, 16.8%, and 11.9% of our expenses,\nrespectively, were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies\nother than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure\nto fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and\nearnings and could materially impact our results of operations. For example, for the year ended\n27\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 31, 2023, our total revenue was lower than anticipated in part due to the strengthening of the U.S dollar.\nWe do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to continue selling our products and services to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency\ncustomers, which may occur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers\nand/or through direct sales to government entities. While we are a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) authorized SaaS service, selling to government entities and other government contractors\npresent a number of unique challenges and risk including the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that differ less favorably from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould expect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability\nunder the civil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced, among other things, by public sector budgetary\ncycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector\ndemand for our products; and\ngovernment-imposed vaccine mandates could result in increased attrition and difficulties in recruiting, and non-\ncompliance with any such mandates could restrict our ability to do business with governmental entities.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be\nrequired to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive\nOrder, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our\ncompliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the\nU.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.\nOur current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing platform or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase\nour base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially\nsuffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products\nto new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our platform, or\nthe introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current platform as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality\n28\nTable of Contents\nthat we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third parties. For example, our\ncloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate carriers that operate the\nPSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that will use our Zoom Phone\nproduct will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our margins for Zoom Phone as\ncompared to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the future may similarly require us\nto compensate or reimburse third parties, all of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If\nthis trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid host base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses; changes in\nexcess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use,\ndeferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples; changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals (including\nprovisions of the recently enacted federal tax legislation titled the Inflation Reduction Act); other fundamental\nchanges in tax law currently being considered by many countries; and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash\ntax liabilities but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. There is a possibility that Congress will defer, repeal, or otherwise modify this requirement in future\nperiods. Absent a change in legislation, we expect it will have a material impact on our cash flows beginning the\ncurrent fiscal year ending January 31, 2023.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue\n29\nTable of Contents\nderived from digital services. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions\noutside of the OECD's Inclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness by increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not\nultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be\nviewed negatively by users, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired\nbusinesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to\nsuccessfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our\ncompany, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process\nwill require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary\nfunctioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which could harm our\nbusiness. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast\nthe financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for\nand model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our\nfuture performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could continue to slow or our revenue could\ndecline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;\ncontraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for\ncapacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities or to adapt and respond\nto inflationary factors affecting our business or future economic recession. The changes the COVID-19 pandemic\nfostered on the way companies operate, including the shifts to remote and hybrid work have limited our ability to\nforecast revenue, costs, and expenses due to the uncertainty around how companies choose to operate in the future,\nincluding the impacts of a remote and hybrid workplace. We have encountered and will encounter risks and\nuncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and\nuncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners, or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nprivacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual\nobligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make\naccessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information,\nincluding personal information, customer and user content, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property,\nthird-party data, business plans, transactions, financial information Our data processing activities may subject us\nto numerous privacy, data protection, and information security obligations, such as various laws, regulations,\nguidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements.\nFor example, in June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice for the EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign\npolitical parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user\ndata, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to\nvideoconference commemorations of the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. In July 2020, we\nreceived subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas\nseek documents and information relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our\nencryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public\nstatements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since\nreceived additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of\nthese investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are\nongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the\ninvestigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these\ninvestigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines,\npenalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection\nlaws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For\nexample, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) applies to personal information of consumers,\nbusiness representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices\nand honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil\npenalties of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover\nsignificant statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) expands the CCPA’s\nrequirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal information and\nestablishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. In addition, effective October 1, 2019,\nNevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among other things,\nthat businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from consumers to opt out\nof the sale of their personal information. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have similarly enacted\ncomprehensive privacy, data protection and information security laws, that emulate the CCPA and CPRA in many\nrespects and have taken or will take effect in 2023. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts\nand increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. Under various laws and\nother obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, we may be required to obtain\ncertain consents to process personal information. Our inability or failure to do so could result in adverse\nconsequences.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern related to\nprivacy, data protection, and information security. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (“EU GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (“UK GDPR”), Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de\nProteção de Dados Pessoais, or “LGPD”) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law\n(“PIPL”) impose strict requirements for processing personal information. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies\nmay face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million\nEuros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal\ninformation brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent\ntheir interests.\nWe also target customers in Asia and have operations in Japan and Singapore, and may be subject to new and emerging\nprivacy, data protection, and information security regimes in Asia, including Japan’s Act on the Protection of\nPersonal Information and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal information from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United\nStates or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe\nand other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal\ninformation to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”)\nhave significantly restricted the transfer of personal information to the United States and other countries whose\nprivacy laws they believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of\ntheir data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that\nmay be used to transfer personal information from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such\nas the EEA and UK’s standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no\nassurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal information to the United\nStates.\nIf there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions\nto the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face\nsignificant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate\npart of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense,\nincreased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work\nwith partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal\ninformation necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal information out of\nthe EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from\nregulators, individual litigants, and activities groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to\nsuspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal information out of Europe for allegedly violating the\nGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.\nFurthermore, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning in products and services. For example, in Europe, there is a proposed regulation related to\nartificial intelligence (“AI”) that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations related to the use of AI-related\nsystems. We may have to change our business practices to comply with such obligations.\nAdditionally, regulators are increasingly scrutinizing companies that process children’s data. Numerous laws,\nregulations, and legally-binding codes, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”),\nCalifornia’s Age Appropriate Design Code (effective in July 2024), the CCPA and CPRA, other U.S. state\ncomprehensive privacy laws, the EU and UK GDPR, and the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, impose various obligations\non companies that process children’s data, including by requiring certain consents to process such data and\nextending certain rights to children and their parents with respect that data. Some of these obligations have wide\nranging applications, including for services that do not intentionally target child users (defined in some\ncircumstances as a user under the age of 18 years old). In particular, COPPA is a U.S. Federal law that applies to\noperators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect\npersonal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they\nare collecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications and\ncollaboration services to schools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid\nclassrooms, distance learning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these\nservices, Zoom may be used by students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information\nfrom such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s\ninformation practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services. If we fail to accurately\nanticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of applicable privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions,\nlitigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such\nfailures, we could be in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us,\nwhich could harm our reputation and business.\nIndividuals are increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver\ntargeted advertising. Third-party platforms have introduced (or plan to introduce) measures to provide users with\nmore privacy controls over targeted advertising activities, and regulators (including in the EEA/UK) are heavily\nscrutinizing the use of technologies used to deliver such advertisements. Major technology platforms on which we\nrely to gather information about consumers have adopted or proposed measures to provide consumers with additional\ncontrol over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal data for targeted advertising or other purposes. In\naddition, legislative proposals and present laws and regulations regulate the use of cookies and other tracking\ntechnologies, electronic communications, and marketing. For example, in the EEA and the UK, regulators are\nincreasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the targeted advertising ecosystem. European\nregulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances where the regulators alleged that appropriate\nconsent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising activities. It is anticipated that the ePrivacy\nRegulation and national implementing laws will replace the current national laws implementing the ePrivacy\nDirective, which may require us to make significant operational changes. In the United States, the CCPA, for\nexample, grants California residents the right to opt-out of a company’s sharing of personal data for advertising\npurposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration, and requires covered businesses to honor user-\nenabled browser signals from the Global Privacy Control.\n32\nTable of Contents\nPartially as a result of these developments, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the collection,\nuse, and sharing of personal information to deliver targeted advertising or other types of tracking. Individuals\nare now more aware of options related to consent, “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals from the\nGlobal Privacy Control), and “ad-blocking” software to prevent the collection of their personal information for\ntargeted advertising purposes. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our products, and any of\nthese developments or changes could materially impair our ability to reach new or existing customers or otherwise\nnegatively affect our operations.\nIn addition to data privacy and security laws, we are contractually subject to industry standards adopted by\nindustry groups and may become subject to such obligations in the future. We are also bound by other contractual\nobligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our efforts to comply with such\nobligations may not be successful. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements, such as\ncompliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security privacy, data protection, and information security. If these policies, materials or statements\nare found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we\nmay be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences.\nObligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security are quickly changing, becoming\nincreasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to\ndiffering applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing\nfor and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to\nour services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process\npersonal information on our behalf.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our privacy, data protection,\nand information security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely\nmay fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third\nparties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable privacy, data\nprotection, and information security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited\nto: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar);\nlitigation (including class-action claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing\npersonal information; and orders to destroy or not use personal information. Any of these events could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of\ncustomers; inability to process personal information or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to\ndevelop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse\npublicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our\n33\nTable of Contents\nservices and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability\nto store and process user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,\ndisclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and\ncustomers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their\nown IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with\ncontrol over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by\nmalicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our\nproducts directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened\ntougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The direct and indirect effects of\ntariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China\neconomic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of\ngovernmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions\nand further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China,\ncould result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade\nrestrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken\nby the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or\nother countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries\nin retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between the United States and China could exacerbate\nthese actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law\nin Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with\nthe business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy\nor operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and\ncertain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or react to these changes.\nFurther, in recent years, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and\ncommunications technology and services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions.\nIn May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to\nimplement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national\nsecurity risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to\ncontracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce\nissued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS transactions that pose a national\nsecurity risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as China. Several aspects of this rule\nremain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule will be implemented and enforced in\npractice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement\nfurther restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty\nregarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will\nsuccessfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the\nexecutive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business,\nincluding in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced\nsales.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations which are\nsubject to varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as\nours, uncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional\ntaxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical\npresence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales\nof our platform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus\nfor sales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently\nmade our software products available to some customers in potential violation of the EAR. As a result, we have\nsubmitted and from time to time will continue to submit as warranted voluntary self-disclosures regarding our\ncompliance with U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”). For instance, since March 2022, we have submitted certain\nreports to BIS detailing the findings from a review of our compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and\nregulations.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that\ncould result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,\nchanges in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with\nthe laws.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the\nhost or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful\nbehavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety\nteam may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or\nreferral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as\na result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely\nbetween jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to\nlegal actions along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may\nface, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the\ncontent shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nOur platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has\nbeen blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,\nor fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we\ncould be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-\nbribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their\nemployees and intermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or\nbenefits to government officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public\ncompanies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation\nand to device and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to\nprevent violations of anti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to\nexpand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In\naddition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\n36\nTable of Contents\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nAs described above, the FCC could reinstate its prior network neutrality regulations or adopt new regulations. See\nPart 1A – Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or\npotential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to\nour competitors, or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform. Changes in FCC regulation of the internet and\ninternet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations on our other services. Such action could\nresult in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the ones we offer.\nThe imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to modify our\nservice offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation could result\nin substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many\nMembers of Congress from both parties support the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of\nCongressional action remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to\nadopt rules interpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that\nis transmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a\nvote on that proposal and the FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The\nDemocratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of\nthe FCC. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or\nthe FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of protection offered by Section 230. In\naddition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to\ninternet platforms, including a lawsuit by former President Trump that, if successful, would greatly limit the\nscope of Section 230. Further, on October 3, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case to determine\nwhether Google should be liable for damages because YouTube’s suggestion algorithm promoted radical Islamic videos\nthat incited a terrorist attack in France. A decision in that case is expected by the end of June 2023. These\nvarious efforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the risks faced by internet-based\nbusinesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in\nliability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for\nour customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business\nmethods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nThe FCC has proposed to revise its rules requiring reporting of breaches of private customer information, known as\nCPNI. If adopted, the proposed rules could broaden the types of CPNI breaches that must be reported, but also could\nlimit the number of reports that must be filed by adopting a minimum threshold for the number of customers\naffected. The proposed rules also would require that breach reports be provided directly to the FCC, which could\nincrease the risk of enforcement action, including fines and behavioral remedies.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that prohibit Chinese companies that are deemed to be a national security risk by other\nfederal agencies from obtaining new authorizations and placed on a list known as the Covered List to sell\ntelecommunications equipment in the U.S. and is considering proposed rules that would ban those companies from\nselling previously-authorized equipment or could prohibit use of their equipment in the U.S. Zoom does not\ncurrently have any equipment from the companies subject to the ban in its network, but if other companies are added\nto the Covered List and the FCC adopts rules that ban sales or use of equipment from companies on the Covered List,\nwe could be required to find new sources for similar equipment or replace existing equipment entirely.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer and the California Public Utilities Commission is now taking the position\nthat it can require VoIP providers like Zoom Phone to obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass\nUSF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in\nour products becoming more expensive. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts\nto apply state telecommunications regulations to services like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or\nfuture state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may\nhave to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nA federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network\nneutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. Trade associations\nrepresenting internet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction,\nand the appeal was denied on January 28, 2022. On April 20, 2022 the Ninth Circuit declined to rehear the case and\nthe appellants have since announced that they will not\n37\nTable of Contents\nfile for an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced,\nmodified, overturned, or vacated.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas that is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses\noperating on the Internet to moderate user-generated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections\ngranted under Section 230. Similar legislation has been introduced in other states in 2022, including a bill that\nhas passed the Georgia State Senate and is pending before the Georgia House. Implementation of the Florida and\nTexas statutes has been stayed by various federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 18, the\nparties in the Florida case requested, and were granted, a stay of the appeals court mandate pending Supreme Court\nreview, and on September 21, 2022, Florida requested that the Supreme Court review the case. On September 16, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision upholding the Texas law. On September 30, the parties\nin that case filed an unopposed motion to stay the Fifth Circuit decision pending Supreme Court review, and the\nFifth Circuit granted that request on October 13, 2022. The parties opposing the Texas law requested that the\nSupreme Court review the case on December 15, 2022. The conflict between the decisions on the two laws increases\nthe likelihood that the Supreme Court will review these statutes. Florida recently amended its statute in an effort\nto address issues that led the court to issue the stay. It is likely that any other such state legislation also\nwould be challenged under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it is preempted by\nSection 230. We cannot predict whether any such state legislation will be adopted, enforced, modified, overturned,\nor vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance\n38\nTable of Contents\nthat the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our products. In addition, we\nbelieve that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our\nbrand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and\nunauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could\nharm our brand and our business. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third\nparties may challenge our proprietary right; our pending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications\nmay not be approved; and we may not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have\nalso devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In\norder to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and\nconfidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These agreements may not effectively\nprevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which\ncase we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further,\nthe laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign\ncountries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we\ndevelop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our\nproprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by\nthird parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may\nbe able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features. Any of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed\nsoftware. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open source\nsoftware and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we could be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic recovery and recent changes in macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation,\nrecessionary or uncertain environments and fluctuations in our currency exchange rates have caused uncertainty in\nour business and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly decreased along with\nthe broader market. There are no assurances that the trading price of our Class A common stock will continue at\nthis level for any period of time. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our\nClass A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock\ninclude the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020, and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2023, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 65.4% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n57.9% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2023, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.7% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 31.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions,\n40\nTable of Contents\nsuch as a merger or other sale of Zoom or our assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common\nstock will be automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that\nis six months following the death or incapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date\nthat Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate\nclass, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly\npublic companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected\nindices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the\nS&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for\ninclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies may\ndepress the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from the indices or depress our trading volume\ncompared to those of other similar companies that are included.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\n41\nTable of Contents\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications and collaboration platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using\nlegacy communication methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product\nfeature that every customer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform\ndoes not provide. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over\ntime, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market\nopportunity estimates will purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even\nif the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow\nfor a variety of reasons outside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks\nmaterializes, it could harm our business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted virtually every\ncountry in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an\nadverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service\ndisruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to\nsupport our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. While we have seen increased usage\nof our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do\nnot generate any revenue. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or that\nnew or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels during the COVID-19 pandemic\nrecovery. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has required and will\ncontinue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In\naddition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market\ndata. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an\nexit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have\ninvested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex\ndue to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to\n43\nTable of Contents\nchanges in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and timing of observable\nprice changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to mitigate this\nvolatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period\nof time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. Changes in\nthe fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to\nour financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, particularly during times of market volatility and\ngeneral economic instability. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt\nsecurities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common\nstock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of\n44\nTable of Contents\nour consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and\nannual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports\nthat will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which\nwould likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable\nto continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are\nrequired to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\nInvestors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance\nfactors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning\nenvironmental, social and governance matters (“ESG”). Some investors may use these non-financial performance\nfactors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our\npolicies and actions relating to ESG are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not\nmeet the ESG standards set by various constituencies.\nAs ESG best practices and reporting standards continue to develop, we may incur increasing costs relating to ESG\nmonitoring and reporting and complying with ESG initiatives. For example, the SEC has recently proposed climate\nchange and ESG reporting requirements, which, if approved, would increase our compliance costs. We may also face\ngreater costs to comply with new ESG standards or initiatives in the European Union. We recently published our ESG\nReport for fiscal year 2022, which describes, among other things, the measurement of our greenhouse gas emissions\nin 2021 and our efforts to reduce emissions. In addition, our ESG Report provides highlights of how we are\nsupporting our workforce, including our efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our disclosures on\nthese matters, or a failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting, may\npotentially harm our reputation and customer relationships. Due to new\n45\nTable of Contents\nregulatory standards and market standards, certain new or existing customers, particularly those in the European\nUnion, may impose stricter ESG guidelines or mandates for, and may scrutinize relationships more closely with,\ntheir counterparties, including us, which may lengthen sales cycles or increase our costs.\nFurthermore, if our competitors’ ESG performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current\ninvestors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain\ninitiatives or goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such\ninitiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy\nthe expectations of investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as\nplanned, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change (such as drought, wildfires,\nhurricanes, increased storm severity and sea level rise), we recognize that there are inherent climate-related\nrisks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate\nchange. For example, certain of our offices have experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-\nrelated events at an increasing frequency, including drought, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality\nimpacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Changing market dynamics, global policy\ndevelopments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the\nU.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers and the\nbusiness of our customers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain or resume\noperations. In addition, we may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements, standards or\nexpectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables people to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications and collaboration platform started with video as its foundation, and\nwe have set the standard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice\nfor large enterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We provide a unified communications and\ncollaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact, connecting them\nthrough frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. Our Developer Platform enables\ncustomers, developers, and service providers to easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-\nleading video communications and collaboration platform, with opportunities for global discovery and distribution.\nOur virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to seamlessly create and manage engaging events.\nWe believe that face-to-face communications build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution while prioritizing their privacy and security. Our 28\nco-located data centers worldwide and the public cloud in conjunction with our proprietary adaptive rate codec\nenable us to provide both high-quality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth\nenvironments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform.\nSubscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products,\nincluding Zoom Phone, Zoom Spaces, Zoom Events, Zoom Contact Center and Zoom IQ for Sales. A host is any user of\nour unified communications and collaboration platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more\nparticipants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We\ndefine a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid user or host or an\norganization of any size (including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Zoom One\nBasic offering is free and gives hosts access to Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that\nmeetings time-out at 40 minutes. Our core paid offerings are available with our Zoom One bundles: Zoom One Pro,\nBusiness, Business Plus, Enterprise, and Enterprise Plus. The Zoom One bundles are designed for different business\nneeds and are composed of Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Whiteboard and Mail and Calendar as well as Zoom\nPhone, Zoom Webinars and Zoom Rooms for our Enterprise plans. We also offer vertical-specific plans for Education,\nHealthcare and Government which provide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant\nlimits, administrative controls, and reporting.\n48\nTable of Contents\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in four specific markets (Australia/New Zealand, Japan,\nUnited Kingdom/Ireland and United States/Canada). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in more than 45 countries and territories\nwhere Zoom has local public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) coverage.\nOur revenue was $4,393.0 million, $4,099.9 million, and $2,651.4 million for the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rate of 7% and 55% for fiscal year 2023\nand fiscal year 2022, respectively. We had net income of $103.7 million, $1,375.6 million, and $672.3 million for\nthe fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities\nwas $1,290.3 million, $1,605.3 million, and $1,471.2 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively.\nMacroeconomic Conditions and other Factors\nRecent changes in macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation, recessionary and uncertain environments, and\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have and may continue to cause uncertainty in our business. For\nthe year ended January 31, 2023, we experienced continued growth in total revenue and revenue from Enterprise\ncustomers. However, macroeconomic conditions, including high inflation and continued uncertainty regarding the\ncurrent and future political and economic environment, have and may continue to impact the future demand for\nsubscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform. For example, for the year ended January 31,\n2023, we experienced unfavorable foreign currency impact as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar compared to certain foreign jurisdictions where we do a significant amount of business, which resulted in a\n$69.1 million negative impact on revenue for the year ended January 31, 2023.\nDuring the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations resorted to mandating employees to work from home,\nwhich resulted in these organizations seeking out video communication solutions like ours to keep employees as\nproductive as possible, even while working from home. There is no assurance that we will experience an increase in\npaid hosts or that new or existing users will continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has\ntapered globally. As reported in prior periods we experienced significant revenue growth. This revenue growth has\ndeclined and we expect our revenue growth to generally decline as compared to prior periods. Many factors may\ncontribute to declines in our growth rate, among other things, higher market penetration, increased competition,\nslowing demand for our platform from the tapering of the COVID-19 pandemic, a slower than anticipated\ncapitalization on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business.\nWe continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nhave been widespread, and while the COVID-19 pandemic has tapered, it continues to fluctuate in severity. Our\nrecent declines in revenue growth are primarily attributable to the tapering of the COVID-19 pandemic along with\nother macroeconomic factors. At the same time, it is starting to become clear that some of the behavioral trends\nthe COVID-19 pandemic fostered, including the shift to remote and hybrid work, may remain in place for an\nindeterminate amount of time. Given this, it is not possible for us to quantify how the tapering of the COVID-19\npandemic has impacted our current and future operations.\nIn addition the global impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including various sanctions and export\nrestrictions on Russia and Belarus by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other\ngovernmental authorities remain highly uncertain. The Russia-Ukraine war impacted our EMEA revenue for the year\nended January 31, 2023. Our customers in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine represented less than 1% of our net assets\nand total consolidated revenue as of the year ended January 31, 2023. If the Russia-Ukraine war continues or\nworsens, leading to additional sanctions, tightened export restrictions, and greater global economic disruptions\nand uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe are continuously monitoring the impact of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as\nthe overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. The implications of macroeconomic conditions on our\nbusiness, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. On\nFebruary 7, 2023, as a result of the economic environment, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce\noperating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The restructuring plan includes\na reduction of our current workforce by approximately 15%.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market\n49\nTable of Contents\nopportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or the future growth\nrate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to\naddress this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who are able to achieve\ndesired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or geography, before\nrolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have deployed our platform\nglobally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of our platform\nalso provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers, such as Zoom for Home,\nRooms at each office location, Developer Platform solutions, Spaces, Events, Contact Center and IQ for Sales. In\norder for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing customers, we will\nneed to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that are responsive to\nour customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing Enterprise customers through our net dollar expansion rate. We define\nEnterprise customers as distinct business units who have been engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers,\nor strategic partners. Revenue from Enterprise customers represented 54.8%, 47.6% and 45.6% of total revenue for\nthe year ending January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the increase\nin user adoption within our Enterprise customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven by the number of\npaid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our subscription revenue from\nthe same set of Enterprise customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion rate as of a\nperiod end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all Enterprise customers as of 12 months\nprior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from all\ncustomers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it\nby 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all Enterprise customers\nfor the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication\nthat they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these Enterprise customers as of the\ncurrent period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and attrition. We divide the\nCurrent Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For the trailing 12-months\ncalculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12 months. Our net dollar\nexpansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our\ncustomer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Enterprise customers. Our trailing\n12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 115%, 130%, and 152% as of January 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nRetention of Online Customers\nIn addition to Enterprise customers, we also have a significant number of customers that subscribe to our services\ndirectly through our website (“Online customers”). Online customers represent a diverse customer base, ranging from\nindividual consumers to small and medium size businesses. We continue to focus on acquisition and retention of our\nonline customer base through various strategies to improve the features and functionalities of our products and\nservices. Revenue from Online customers represented 45.2%, 52.4%, and 54.4% of total revenue for the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The ability to retain these Online customers will have an\nimpact on our future revenue. The online monthly average churn for our Online customers was 3.4%, 3.9%, and 4.9%\nper month for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. One of the dynamics in the\nOnline portion of the business is the MRR contribution from customers that have retained Zoom services for a\ncertain portion of time as these customers tend to maintain their subscriptions and contribute meaningfully to the\nOnline business. As of January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the percentage of total Online MRR from Online customers\nwith a continual term of service of at least 16 months was 72.0%, 59.0% and 10.0% respectively.\nWe calculate our online average monthly churn by starting with the Online customer MRR as of the beginning of the\napplicable quarter (“Entry MRR”). We define Entry MRR as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements\nfrom all Online customers except for subscriptions that we recorded as churn in a previous quarter based on the\ncustomers' earlier indication to us of their intention to cancel that subscription. We then determine the MRR\nrelated to customers who canceled or downgraded their subscription or notified us of that intention during the\napplicable quarter (“Applicable Quarter MRR Churn”) and divide the Applicable Quarter MRR Churn by the applicable\nquarter Entry MRR to arrive at the MRR churn rate for Online Customers for the applicable quarter. We then divided\nthat amount by three to calculate the online average monthly churn.\n50\nTable of Contents\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, Zoom Webinars,\nand Zoom Events and launched Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, Zoom IQ for sales, Zoom Whiteboard and Zoom\nMail and Calendar. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of Zoom for Home, a solution\ndesigned for the home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible hardware. We also deliver\nZoom Phone calling plans in more than 45 countries and territories as of January 31, 2023. Third-party developers\nare also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for customers and developers to\nextend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more developers and other third parties\nuse our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the ubiquitous platform for\ncommunications and collaboration. We will need to expend additional resources to continue introducing new products,\nfeatures, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the value of our platform with\ntheir own applications.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants as well as on Zoom Phone. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures\nZoom meetings by default, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host, or originating caller in the case of Zoom Phone,\nas opposed to Zoom's servers, generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to distribute these keys\nto the other meeting participants or call recipient.\nInternational Opportunity\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 30%, 33%, and 31%\nof our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease in\nrevenue from the rest of the world in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was due to the impact of the\nstrengthening of the U.S dollar along with macroeconomic conditions in the EMEA region. We plan to add local sales\nsupport in further select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in\ncertain international markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for\nour platform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of Enterprise customers is an indicator of our potential future\nbusiness opportunities, the growth of our business, and an indicator of our market penetration. Increasing\nawareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of our technology, has expanded\nthe diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, we\nexpect Enterprise customers to represent a larger share of our business. As of January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we\nhad approximately 213,000, 191,000, and 141,100 Enterprise customers, respectively.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 27%, 22%, and 20% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had 3,471, 2,725, and 1,644 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid\npenetration of larger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\n51\nTable of Contents\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metrics, may calculate t metrics differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP metrics\nas a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023             2022             2021\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,290,262    $   1,605,266    $   1,471,177\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -103,826         -132,590          -79,972\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,186,436    $   1,472,676    $   1,391,205\nNet cash used in investing activities       $                -318,322    $  -2,859,097    $  -1,562,420\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing    $                -936,942    $      34,068    $   2,050,277\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications and\ncollaboration platform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also\nprovide services, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are\ngenerally considered distinct from the access to our unified communications and collaboration platform. The amount\nof revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the\ncontract term which can include a free period discount.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-\nlocated data centers, third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses,\namortization of capitalized software development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated\noverhead.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs.\n52\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; certain indirect taxes; litigation settlements; corporate security and regulatory\nexpenses; and allocated overhead.\n(Losses) gains on Strategic Investments, Net\n(Losses) gains on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable\nsecurities and effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign\njurisdictions where we conduct

increased by $293.1 million, or 7.1%, compared to the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2022. The increase in revenue was due to a 23.6% increase in revenue from subscription\nservices provided to Enterprise customers, of which 87.6% and 12.4% were from existing and new customers,\nrespectively. This increase was partially offset by a 7.7% decline in revenue from subscription services provided\nto Online customers.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023               2022          $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nCost of revenue    $                          1,100,451       $  1,054,554       $    45,897         4.4  %\nGross profit                                  3,292,509          3,045,310           247,199         8.1  %\nGross margin                                       74.9  %            74.3  %\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $45.9 million, or 4.4%, compared to the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $147.9 million in personnel-\nrelated expenses, which includes an increase of $104.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, mainly driven\nby additional headcount and expanded equity programs, an increase of $29.8 million related to subscription to\nsoftware-based services, and an increase in allocated overhead of $8.7 million , partially offset by a decrease of\n$144.6 million in costs mainly driven by the net impact of the transition from third-party cloud hosting to\ninternal data centers and cloud optimization.\nGross margin increased to 74.9% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 from 74.3% for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2022. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to increased efficiencies as we expanded our internal\ndata center capacity; in addition, during the current fiscal year, we reinstated the 40-minute time limit for\nmeetings with more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 school domains\nworldwide, which was temporarily lifted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These cost-saving measures were\npartially offset by the impact from higher stock-based compensation expense.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023          2022       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nResearch and development    $                            774,059    $  362,990    $   411,069       113.2  %\nResearch and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $411.1 million, or 113.2%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related\nexpenses of $388.4 million, which includes a $248.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, mainly\ndriven by the increased headcount and expanded equity programs, and an increase of $139.7 million in non-stock\nbased related personal costs due to a 67% increase in headcount. The remainder of the increase was primarily\nattributable to an increase of $21.6 million in allocated overhead expenses.\n55\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023            2022       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nSales and marketing    $                          1,696,590    $  1,135,959    $   560,631        49.4  %\nSales and marketing expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $560.6 million, or 49.4%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due\nto higher personnel-related expenses of $471.4 million, which includes an increase of $303.1 million in stock based\ncompensation, mainly driven by additional headcount and expanded equity programs, and an increase of $82.1 million\nin amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of\n$76.9 million in marketing and sales event-related costs mainly due to an increase in awareness, social media and\ndigital programs, and an increase of $14.9 million in allocated overhead expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023          2022       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nGeneral and administrative    $                            576,431    $  482,770    $    93,661        19.4  %\nGeneral and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $93.7 million, or 19.4%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.

The change in income taxes was\nprimarily due to tax shortfalls on stock-based compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense,\nchanges in the valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets, and other compensation-related permanent\ndifferences as of January 31, 2023, compared to tax windfalls on stock-based compensation and the valuation\nallowance release on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $5.4 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the recent\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation, recessionary environments, and the fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, could impact the timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks\ndetailed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects,\nwe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by\noperations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on\ngrowth opportunities. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through\na combination of cash flows from operating activities and available cash balances. Our future capital requirements\nwill depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency,\nthe timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as\nwell as expenses associated with our international expansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital\nexpenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces as well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the\nfuture, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies,\nincluding intellectual property rights. We may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nIn the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms\nacceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $         105,176    $                 25,886    $   48,706    $  22,580    $      8,004\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         298,855                     191,902       104,253        2,700               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         404,031    $                217,788    $  152,959    $  25,280    $      8,004\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,290.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared\nto $1,605.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in operating cash flow was mainly\ndriven by higher income tax payments and lower increases in deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $318.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $120.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of\n$103.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $69.1 million, net purchases of marketable securities of\n$13.9 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $11.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $2,859.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $2,404.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $305.1\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $132.6 million, purchases of intangible assets of $13.0 million,\nand cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $3.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $936.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to cash paid for repurchases of common stock of $1.0 billion, offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock\npursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $53.7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock\noptions of $8.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $34.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was primarily\ndue to proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our ESPP of $59.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of\nstock options of $14.4 million, offset by proceeds from international employee stock sales remitted to employees\nand tax authorities of $40.0 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 , please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A\ncommon, which was completed in December 2022. See Note 10 \"Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\" of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to share repurchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and\nSignificant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following critical estimates involve\na greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We apply judgment during the identification of a contract to\ndetermine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the\ncustomer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information\npertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the\ntransaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue\nrecognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform\nand related significant features. We do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized\non a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2023, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful\n59\nTable of Contents\nlives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to\nthe remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not\namortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine\nwhether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine\nthat the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and\namortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have not recorded any impairment charges\nduring the fiscal years presented.\nStrategic Investments\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment evaluates key factors including but not\nlimited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which\nthe investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair\nvalue by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying\nvalue for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent\nin enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2023 would not have had\na material impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K."

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a portion of our revenue from\namounts denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the\njurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in Australia, China, Europe and the United\nStates. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 20.0% ,\n22.6% and 20.2% of our revenue, respectively and 10.8%,\n60\nTable of Contents\n16.8% and 11.9% of our expenses, respectively were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effect\nof a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a\nmaterial impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating\nresults, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our\nexposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $4.3 billion as of January 31, 2023.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds and high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n61\nTable of Contents"

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n63\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,393\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2023.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

of Contents\nZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nSummary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nconnect people through our platform of core unified communications and collaboration platform, which frictionlessly\nbrings together video, phone, chat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences across disparate devices and\nlocations. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose,\nCalifornia.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2023.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation\nexpense, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of\ndeferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2023 or 2022. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $ 13.1million and $ 10.2million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\n71\nTable of Contents\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2023            31, 2022\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        590,610    $        444,369\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -24,900             -17,000\nLess: Allowance for returns                    -8,306              -7,696\nAccounts receivable, net             $        557,404    $        419,673\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, our assessment considered the recent changes in macroeconomic\nconditions such as inflation, recessionary and uncertain environments, and fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates has on our estimates of credit and collectibility trends. Below is a rollforward of our allowance\nfor credit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nJanuary 31, 2023       January 31, 2022\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            17,000    $            20,500\nProvision for credit losses                     45,211                 32,587\nWrite-offs                                     -37,311                -36,087\nBalance as of end of year          $            24,900    $            17,000\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through (losses) gains on strategic\ninvestments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n72\nTable of Contents\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments. Privately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured\nat cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in\n(losses) gains on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment.As of January 31, 2023, we recognized an immaterial amount of impairment to our\nprivately held debt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications and collaboration platform during the\napplication development stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be\nused to perform the function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and\nequipment, net. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\nincurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s\nestimated useful life, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We have\ncapitalized $ 18.0million, $ 20.2million, and $ 19.4million of software development costs during the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\n73\nTable of Contents\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at\nthe commencement date based on the present value of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease\nliabilities as our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to\napproximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment\nwhere the leased asset is located. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments\nmade at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and\nwhen a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance\nleases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2023 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-\nlived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period\nof amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the\nuseful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine that the life of an\nintangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively\nover its estimated remaining useful life. There were no impairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting\n74\nTable of Contents\nservices, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue is\nrecognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract term which can include a\nfree period discount. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications and collaboration platform, which consists of one or more software-based services.\nOur customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we\nprovide a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications and collaboration platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a\nprofessional manner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include\nservice-level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and\npermitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits\nrepresent a form of variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements\nin the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and related services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the\nrelated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 2% of total revenue during the periods presented.\n75\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located\ndata center costs, third-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related\nexpenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments,\nand allocated overhead costs. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related\ndepreciation, health care benefits, training, and other employee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and\noperating expenses based on applicable headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and\ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 64.7million, $\n40.9million, and $ 34.8million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, RSUs, and ESPP) is measured\nbased on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of assumptions, including the fair value of the\nunderlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock,\nrisk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related\n76\nTable of Contents\nto uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are\nincluded with the related tax liability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options, to be participating securities as holders of such\nsecurities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common\nstock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating\ndecision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below. The following\ntable presents our property and equipment, net of depreciation and amortization, by geographic region:\nAs of January 31,\n2023\n(in thousands)          2022\nAmericas                             $            189,486    $  180,033\nAPAC                                               39,325        36,715\nEMEA                                               24,010         5,606\nTotal property and equipment, net    $            252,821    $  222,354\nRecent Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of\nEquity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , which clarifies and amends the guidance of measuring\nthe fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity\nsecurities. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years. We early adopted ASU No. 2022-03 for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. Adoption\nof the ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is\npermitted. We early adopted ASU No. 2021-08 for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. Adoption of the ASU did\nnot have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n77\nTable of Contents\n2.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 91.6million and $ 59.7million as of January 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and the amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within other assets, noncurrent on the\nconsolidated balance sheets was immaterial as of January 31, 2023 and 2022.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 1,140.7million, $ 858.2million, and $\n222.0million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n3,434.4million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,308.4million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 2,126.0million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 56%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform and related significant features.\nAmortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit.

Business Combinations\nOn May 19, 2022, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Solvvy, Inc., a private technology\ncompany specializing in customer support automation, for an all-cash purchase consideration of $ 121.2million. The\nacquisition adds to our customer service capabilities and enhances our integrated platform by providing\nconversational AI capabilities. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 95.0million was attributed to goodwill, $ 26.7million to intangible\nassets (consisting of $ 12.0million to developed technology and $ 14.7million to customer relationships), and $\n0.5million to other net liabilities acquired. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing\nproducts expected to be realized from the acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nAt the date of the acquisition, the developed technology and customer relationships both had an estimated useful\nlife of 5.0years, and both are amortized using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful\nlives. Amortization expense of developed technology is recorded within cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and amortization expense of customer relationships is recorded within sales and marketing\nin the consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2023, the developed technology and customer\nrelationships both had a remaining useful life of 4.3years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto six years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our Hardware-as-a-Service (“HaaS”)\noffering. We elect to apply the lessor practical expedient per ASC 842 and account for HaaS with customers as a\ncombined performance obligation with the right to access our unified communications and collaboration platform\nunder ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach maturity, we consider\nvarious factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist to determine whether\nwe are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense for the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 32.7million, $ 22.8million and $ 14.5million , respectively, excluding\nshort-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was immaterial for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 .\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n2023\nReported as:                                 (in thousands, except life and\nAssets:                                                        percentages)                     2022\nOperating lease right-of-use         $                               80,906               $   95,965\nassets\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other\ncurrent                              $                               22,790               $   20,697\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities,                                         73,687                   85,018\nnoncurrent\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                               96,477               $  105,715\nWeighted average remaining lease                                             4.3 years                5.1 years\nterm\nWeighted average discount rate                                          3.8  %                   4.0  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023         2022         2021\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  27,120    $  22,679    $  13,717\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  13,857    $  16,784    $  39,918\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2023, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\n84\nTable of Contents\nAs of January 31, 2023\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2024                                 $                  25,886\n2025                                                    27,165\n2026                                                    21,541\n2027                                                    14,119\n2028                                                     8,461\nThereafter                                               8,004\nTotal operating lease payments       $                 105,176\nLess: imputed interest                                  -8,699\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                  96,477\n8.

Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2023, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 191.9million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 107.0million.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 76.2million and $ 87.2million, respectively, of which $ 33.9million and $\n33.3million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 42.3million and $\n53.9million are included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated\n86\nTable of Contents\nbalance sheets, based on our best estimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those\ndates. Our estimate of a probable outcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and\nmarketing activities, revenue subject to sales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each\nperiod. No significant adjustments to the sales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for changes to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our\nassumptions may occur in the future as we obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded\nliability.\nOther Contingencies\nIn June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to\nvideoconference commemorations of the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. In July 2020, we\nreceived subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California\n(“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various security, data protection\nand privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage\nmetrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts\nbetween our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by\nany foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United\nStates. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully\ncooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation.\nThese investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately\ndiscover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict\nthe outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur\nsubstantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as reputational harm.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our\nofficers in the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of ours. The\ncomplaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934, and\nRule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about our data privacy and\nsecurity measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions\nwere consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead\nplaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on May 20, 2021.\nPlaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the motion to\ndismiss was filed on August 9, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our\nmotion to dismiss. On March 14, 2022, we moved for reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss.\nOn March 22, 2022, the court ordered plaintiff to respond to our motion, which plaintiff did on March 29, 2022. On\nApril 22, 2022, we answered the complaint.\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is\nstayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On October 27, 2021, a third\nsubstantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated and\nremain stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action.\nWe believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the\nuncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among\nother things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss that may result from these actions.\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in various U.S. federal district\ncourts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with\nthird parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state consumer\nprotection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims, such as negligence and\nunjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs\n87\nTable of Contents\nseek various forms of injunctive and monetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive\ndamages, and attorneys’ fees. The federal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the NDCA with our\nconsent; lead plaintiffs’ counsel have been appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class\naction complaint on October 28, 2020. On March 11, 2021, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion\nto dismiss, and gave plaintiffs leave to amend. On July 30, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with\nplaintiffs to settle the action on a classwide basis, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the\nsettlement with the court on July 31, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, we have paid $ 85.0million into an escrow account that will be used to pay\nclaims filed by settlement class members, attorneys’ fees and expenses, administrative costs, and service payments\nto plaintiffs. On April 22, 2022, the Court granted final approval of the settlement. On May 19, 2022, twoobjectors\nto the settlement appealed the Court's final approval order. On May 20, 2022, a third objector appealed the Court’s\nfinal approval order. On October 17, 2022, we, plaintiffs, and all threeobjector-appellants agreed to settle the\nappeals, and on December 16, 2022, the Court approved the settlements. On January 13, 2023, an appeal of the order\napproving the objector-appellant settlements was filed, which is still pending. On May 30, 2022, a new class action\nwas filed against us in the NDCA raising privacy claims similar to those raised in the U.S. Privacy Class Actions\non behalf of a putative class of users of Zoom who reside in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom\nand who are not members of the settlement class in the U.S. Privacy Class Actions. On July 12, 2022, we moved to\ndismiss this new class action and on February 14, 2023, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but allowed\nplaintiffs leave to amend. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves\nagainst it. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the case, and the legal standard must be\nmet for among other things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n10. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nPreferred Stock\nIn connection with the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective,\nwhich authorized the issuance of 200,000,000shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001with\nrights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. As of\nJanuary 31, 2023 and 2022, there were noshares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that are authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\n88\nTable of Contents\nEquity Financing\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 5,882,353shares of our\nClass A common stock, including 735,294shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase\nadditional shares, at $ 340.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 1,980.0million, net of underwriters’\ndiscounts and commissions. The other related offering costs were immaterial.\nCommon Stock\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2023          2022\nStock options outstanding                        4,800,616     6,195,205\nRSUs outstanding                                21,868,533     5,546,366\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                 2,851,856     1,784,687\nRemaining shares available for future           51,367,359    56,620,720\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future           11,930,797    10,685,867\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock            92,819,161    80,832,845\nreserved\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 1.0billion of our Class A\ncommon stock, which was completed in December 2022. During the year ended January 31, 2023, we purchased and\nsubsequently retired 11,170,907shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 1.0billion.\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time. In addition, the number\nof shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan automatically increases on February\n1 of each calendar year, starting on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the\ntotal number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of the fiscal year\nbefore the date of each automatic increase or (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors\nprior to the applicable February 1.\n89\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nStock Options\nOutstanding                    Weighted-\nStock       Weighted-    Average\nOptions         Average    Remaining               Aggregate\n(in thousands, except share,        Exercise    Contractual             Intrinsic\nlife and per share data)           Price    Life (Years)                Value\nOutstanding as of January                        6,195,205    $       8.08                  6.0    $    905,744\n31, 2022\nExercised                                       -1,299,758    $       6.60                         $    121,539\nCanceled/forfeited/expired                         -94,831    $      21.11\nOutstanding as of January                        4,800,616    $       8.22                  4.9    $    322,929\n31, 2023\nVested and expected to\nvest as of                                       4,800,616    $       8.22                  4.9    $    322,929\nJanuary 31, 2023\nExercisable as of January                        4,747,885    $       7.77                  4.9    $    321,287\n31, 2023\nThere were nooptions granted for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The intrinsic value of the\noptions exercised, which represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of\nexercise and the exercise price of each option, was $ 121.5million, $ 843.0million, and $ 1,786.7million during the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, unrecognized stock-based\ncompensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options was $ 1.2million, which is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted-average period of 0.3years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of RSU activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nRSUs\nUnvested                      Weighted-Average\nRSUs       Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nUnvested as of January 31, 2022     5,546,366    $                           232.58\nGranted                            22,136,660    $                            93.20\nVested                             -3,977,915    $                           173.22\nForfeited                          -1,836,578    $                           148.82\nUnvested as of January 31, 2023    21,868,533    $                           109.31\nIn October 2021, we added a feature that modified certain existing RSU awards to provide for a supplemental award\nbased on certain future stock price criteria. The feature was subsequently modified in March and October 2022 to\nprovide potential additional supplemental awards. The features and resulting modifications resulted in incremental\nstock-based compensation expense that is being recognized from the respective modification dates through the\nremaining requisite service period for each of the original awards. In November 2022, we cancelled one of the\nfeatures related to a sub-population of the modified awards. As a result, the amount of the unrecognized\ncompensation cost as calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation approach related to the cancelled awards of $\n207.7million was recognized during the quarter ended January 31, 2023.\nAs of January 31, 2023, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested RSUs was $\n2,579.0million, including the impact of the modification, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 2.8years.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 ESPP, which became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\n90\nTable of Contents\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019.

Based on the available\nobjective evidence during the year ended January 31, 2023, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not\nthat the tax benefits of the U.K. net deferred tax assets may not be realized. Accordingly, we maintained a full\nvaluation allowance against the tax benefits of these net deferred tax assets. Based on the available objective\nevidence during the year ended January 31, 2023, we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits\nrelating to U.S. losses that are capital in nature may not be realized prior to expiration. Accordingly, we have\nmaintained a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. Based on the available objective evidence\nduring the year ended January 31, 2023, we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of certain\nstate net deferred tax assets may not be realized. Management applied significant judgement in assessing the\npositive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of certain state deferred tax assets\nthat were more likely than not to be realized in the future. Accordingly, given our current earnings, anticipated\nfuture earnings, and continued accumulation of certain state tax credits, we have recorded a full valuation\nallowance against the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain the applicable valuation\nallowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation\nallowance.\nAs of January 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 22.9million for federal income\ntax purposes, $ 26.9million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if unused.\nWe also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 32.5million, which have an indefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2023, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 1.2million for\nfederal income tax purposes and $ 22.8million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development\ntax credits have a twenty-year carryover period while the state research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382\nand Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. Such provisions limit\nthe net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences,\nincluding significant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382 review and determined that materially none\nof our operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n93\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2023         2022         2021\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  19,171    $  14,884    $   8,106\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                   877            —          314\nGross decreases                                                     —       -3,764            —\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                10,547        8,211        6,001\nGross decreases                                                     —            —            —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                  -191         -160         -422\nAcquisitions                                                        —            —          885\nBalance, end of year                        $                  30,404    $  19,171    $  14,884\nAs of January 31, 2023, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 30.4million ($\n32.5million total, including $ 1.6million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2022, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 19.2million ($ 19.6million total, including $\n0.4million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2021, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 14.9million ($ 15.0million total, including $ 0.1million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 1.6million, $ 0.4million, and $ 0.1million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2023, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are capitalizing research and development expenses incurred in\nfiscal year 2023. These expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic research and fifteen\nyears for international research. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash tax liabilities but\nalso decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The cash\nflow impact may decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. The act included tax provisions for a 15% corporate\nbook income minimum tax effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the Inflation\nReduction Act to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n94\nTable of Contents\n12.

Subsequent Events\nOn February 7, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs and continue\nadvancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of our current workforce by\napproximately 15%. Decisions regarding the elimination of positions are subject to local law and consultation\nrequirements in certain countries, as well as our business needs.\nWe estimate that we will incur approximately $ 50million to $ 68million in charges in connection with the Plan,\nwhich will be substantially incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. These charges primarily relate to\nemployee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation. Of the aggregate amount\nof charges that we estimate we will incur in connection with the Plan, we expect that approximately $ 43million to\n$ 59million will be in future cash expenditures.\n95\nTable of Contents\nThe actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Plan are expected to be substantially complete by\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nThe estimates of the charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing\nthereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and\nactual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures\nnot currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the\nimplementation of the Plan."

                "content": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected."

We put innovation in customers' hands quickly to serve their needs.\nDesigned for hybrid work: Zoom is the only platform designed for hybrid communication and today’s unique hybrid\nwork needs.\nZoom just works: Ease of use is a core design principle, along with quality and reliability.\nEnterprise readiness: Zoom is built to meet the needs of enterprises, with robust reliability, security,\ncompliance, and privacy capabilities and policies.\nCost-effective and value-focused: The total cost of ownership of the Zoom platform, across the employee\nexperience and customer experience, is less than that of our competitors.\nOpen platform: The Zoom developer ecosystem enables customers to choose the apps and integrations they prefer. We\noffer more than 2,500 integrations, including with major software vendors.\nWe’re on a mission to reimagine the way we communicate and collaborate in a hybrid working world. Zoom brings\nemployee and customer experience together into one platform that people love to use. Flagship products like Zoom\nMeetings, Zoom Phone, and Zoom Team Chat are among the core products on the platform that are critical to business\ncommunication and collaboration needs. We strive to continue building a platform that helps people work smarter, be\nmore engaged with work, and better connect with each other. Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) has been core to Zoom’s\nproduct DNA over many years, grounded in our conviction that AI can make work more human by strengthening\ncollaboration, productivity, and inclusivity.\nIn fiscal year 2024, Zoom continued to invest in AI and focused on three key areas regarding AI innovation:\nsupporting individual productivity, powering better collaboration, and helping customer-facing teams delight their\ncustomers. We recently launched Zoom AI Companion, our smart assistant that is designed to empower workers to\nincrease productivity, improve team effectiveness, and enhance skills. Additionally, we introduced our federated\napproach to AI, which enables us to make Zoom’s AI capabilities accessible and affordable so that more people can\nincorporate them in their day-to-day workflows. In line with our commitment to responsible AI, Zoom does not use\ncustomer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or other communications (such as poll results,\nwhiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party AI models.\nZoom continues to be at the center of hybrid work. Our continued product innovation is laser-focused on supporting\na hybrid work environment, with new innovations in areas such as document collaboration, hybrid workspaces, and\nemployee communication. Our acquisition of Workvivo, an employee experience platform, deepened our commitment to\ncreating a platform that is focused on connecting and engaging employees.\nUnlike most Contact Center as a Service (“CCaaS”) solutions that are only optimized for voice, Zoom Contact Center\nis an omnichannel cloud contact center platform that is optimized for video and intentionally supports a robust\nsuite of channels, such as voice and video, SMS, and webchat. The result is a one-stop shop designed for customer\nexperience leaders to deliver excellence to their customers and to strengthen workforce engagement.\nThe happiness we deliver is recognized by our customers. Zoom has consistently earned high scores across customer\nreview sites, Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2, including being recognized as a 2023 Top Rated Vendor in\nUnified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) by TrustRadius, and Leader badge for Zoom Contact Center by G2.\nIndustry analysts also recognize our market leadership across our platform and products: Gartner has named Zoom a\nleader in the Magic Quadrant for UCaaS for the fourth year in a row, and Workvivo was named a leader in the Magic\nQuadrant for Intranet\n6\nTable of Contents\nPackaged Solutions. Forrester published its Forrester Wave for Conversational Intelligence, where Zoom Revenue\nAccelerator debuted as a Strong player. IDC named Zoom Events as a leader in its IDC MarketScape for Worldwide\nVirtual Events Applications. Zoom was also named to Fortune’s 2023 Most Admired Companies list for the third year\nin a row, and Fast Company’s 2022 Next Big Things in Tech list highlighted Zoom Events.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We deliver happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that\ndelights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these\npractices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our\nexisting customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nusers to our platform, we promote usage that allows them and their meeting attendees to experience the Zoom\ndifference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates\nthe viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales representatives, online\nchannel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively drive upgrades to our paid\noffering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication and\ncollaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of\nengineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base. Our core areas of focus will be bolstering innovation on products in the following categories:\nemployee experience, customer experience, core communications and generative AI.\nDrive international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world, we\nare poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, phone, and contact center for a\ncomplete and integrated set of communications services.\nGrow our developer ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Through the Zoom Developer ecosystem, we enable\ncustomers and their developers to build their own solutions with our underlying platform technology, seamlessly\nembed our platform into their own offerings, and integrate their applications across Zoom products using our\nextensive library of application program interfaces (“APIs”) and selection of software development kits (“SDKs”).\nOur app marketplace further extends the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development and\ndistribution of apps and integrations. We continue to partner with video conferencing hardware and peripheral\nproviders, as well as with software providers, including Palo Alto Networks, Zendesk, and Box.\nOur Platform\nWe provide a unified communications and collaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes\nhow people interact, connecting them through frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and\nmore. Our products are grouped under the following categories, which are further described below:\nCore Communications - Streamlining communications with an all-in-one app\nAI - Driving impact with intelligence\nEmployee Experience - Making teamwork more meaningful\nCustomer Experience - Strengthening customer relationships\nDeveloper Ecosystem - Enabling seamless workflows\n7\nTable of Contents\nCore Communications\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provides HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems.

Zoom’s E2EE uses the same 256-bit AES GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants. Additionally, a customer managed key (“CMK”) service\nallows organizations to provide and manage their own encryption keys for certain customer content stored at rest in\nthe Zoom Cloud. The organization needs to manage the keys in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service.

For information on the\nrisks associated with our international operations, see “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry” under\n“Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and GoTo, bundled productivity solution providers with video functionality,\nincluding Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams, and UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including 8x8, Avaya, and\nRingCentral, as well as consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including\nAmazon, Apple, and Facebook.

We actively seek patent protection covering inventions\noriginating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the\nUnited States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and\nexternal controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

We strive to change the way business is done\nthrough our communications technology and our company culture.

Our approach to DEI is driven across four\nstrategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how\nwe include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).\nWe have taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College,\nAnitaB.org, and a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, our Zoom Talks\ninitiative creates ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about one another’s unique backgrounds. We have a\nnumber of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women, Asian and Pacific Islander,\nVeteran, and LGBTQ+ communities.

We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nOver the past several years, we conducted a comprehensive employee survey with regular follow-ups and engaged in\npeer research to make thoughtful decisions on how to move forward in an evolving world of work. Two priorities were\nimmediately clear: keeping our employees safe and supporting them through a meaningful employee experience. We\nbelieve maintaining a flexible working environment for our employees is a key priority.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2011 under the name Saasbee, Inc., and in\nFebruary 2012, we changed our name to Zoom Communications, Inc.

You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and upsell additional products and new product\ncategories to existing customers, and upgrade free users to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers,\nrenewals, or upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers, and maintain and expand our relationships with our\nexisting customers, including upselling additional products and new product categories to our existing customers\nand upgrading users from a free plan to one of our paid offerings.\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. Customers may also terminate or reduce the size of their\nexisting subscriptions. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers will renew their subscriptions\nutilizing the same tier of plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier, or purchase additional products, if they renew at\nall. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such as\ndissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer no longer having a need for our products, or a belief\nthat a competitor’s product is better, more secure, or less expensive than our products and platform. For example,\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions. As a result, our customer\nbase shifted largely from businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. Following\nthe pandemic, some of our customers reduced or discontinued their use of our platform, and additional customers may\ndo so in the future. Additionally, this shift in mix has resulted and may continue to result in higher non-renewal\nrates than we have experienced in the past. Renewals are also impacted by reductions in customer information\ntechnology spending budgets or a decision by the customer to consolidate their spending budgets on one of our\ncompetitor’s platforms, both of which are more likely to occur during periods of high inflation or recessionary or\nuncertain economic environments. We must continually add new customers and licenses to grow our business and to\nreplace customers and licenses who choose not to continue to use our platform. Finally, any decrease in user\nsatisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage users of our free offering to upgrade to one\nof our paid offerings by recommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications.\nHowever, free users may never upgrade to one of our paid offerings. We also seek to expand within organizations by\nadding new licenses, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of our platform into\nother teams and departments within an organization. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade free users to one\nof our paid offerings or expand the number of licenses within organizations, our business would be harmed.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and may continue to decline in future periods.\nOur revenue growth has fluctuated in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior\nquarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. There are no assurances we will be able to\nsustain or increase our revenue growth in future periods, and our revenue growth rate may continue to decline in\nfuture periods. Many factors may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher market penetration,\nincreased competition, macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, recessionary or uncertain economic\nenvironments, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, slowing demand for our platform, a lower than\nanticipated capitalization on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our\n14\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, among others. Our growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business and the\ntrading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors, would\nimpair the delivery of our services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers.\nDamage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in\ninterruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, other\ninterruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to,\ninfrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber\nextortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage, local administrative actions, changes to\nlegal or permitting requirements, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify\nthe cause or causes of these problems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial\noutages in our services that impacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in\nconnection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center\nfacilities or other reasons, we may move or transfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not\nincluding our China data center. Despite precautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data\ntransfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in\nconnection with any such move or transfer. Interruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our\nrevenue; may require us to issue credits or pay penalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause\ncustomers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers. Our ability\nto attract and retain customers and licenses depends on our ability to provide customers and users with a highly\nreliable platform and even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, customers may\nexperience delays or interruptions in service as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could result in the\nloss of customers who use our unified communications and collaboration platform because of its reliability and\nperformance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new co-located data centers throughout the world to meet\nincreased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner, including as a\nresult of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease; and other public health related measures, any of which could disrupt our\nservice. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant period\nof time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all\neventualities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of\nterrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other\nunanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing, and\nexisting and new market entrants, particularly established companies with greater resources than we have, that\nprovide technologies to improve communication and collaboration technologies platforms, such as AI and machine\nlearning, could also increase the level of competition in the market. Certain features of our current platform\ncompete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products offered by:\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services into our platform, and with the introduction of new technologies and market\nentrants, including AI, we expect competition to intensify in the future.\nIn February 2022, we launched Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for\nvideo, which competes against companies that offer similar services, such as Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE\ninContact, and new competitors that may enter that market in the future. As we continue to build out our platform,\nwe may face increased competition against companies that offer similar services and new competitors that may enter\nthat market in the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions\nfrom smaller customers, many of whom are consumers or small and medium sized businesses. With respect to these\nsmaller customers, we face competition from more consumer-oriented platforms, most of which have more experience\nwith the consumer market than we do. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive\nadvantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and\nservices; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing relationships; more third-party integration; greater\naccessibility across devices or applications; greater access to larger user bases; major distribution agreements\nwith hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical, and other resources. Some of our\ncompetitors may make acquisitions or strategic investments or enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader\nrange of products and services than we do, which may prevent us from using such third parties' technology or\noffering such products or services. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We\nexpect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced to engage in\nprice-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain\ncustomers in response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on occasion, offer\ncustomers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in deferred billings or\nlong-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts receivable.\nOur results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should\nnot be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business. For example, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our\nunified communications and collaboration platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of\nwhich was attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased demand, we\nhave incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and\nexpanding our capacity. Fluctuation in our results may negatively impact the value of our securities. Factors that\nmay cause fluctuations in our results of operations include, without limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced plans;\nour ability to attract new customers and upgrade free users to one of our paid offerings;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles and linearity of our bookings, especially with respect to sales to large\nenterprises and highly regulated industries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign\ngovernmental agencies;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases, and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service, network outages, or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits, regulatory actions or investigations, legislator scrutiny, or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer or\nbusiness spending.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, such as high inflation and the responses by\ncentral banking authorities to control such inflation, recessionary or uncertain environments, U.S. federal debt\nceiling negotiations and the risk of a U.S. government shutdown, fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange\nrates and global impacts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and the surrounding\narea and the United States' ongoing trade disputes with China and other countries. While some customers may view a\nsubscription to our platform as a cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a\nsubscription to our platform as a discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their information technology\nspending on our platform during an economic downturn or during times of economic uncertainty. Given current\neconomic conditions, including inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience a loss of users and\ncustomers, as well as a reduction in demand for our platform, especially if the effects of the current economic\nenvironment have a prolonged impact on various industries that our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform addresses. In addition to the foregoing, adverse developments that affect financial institutions,\ntransactional counterparties or other third parties, such as bank failures, or concerns or speculation about any\nsimilar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which in turn may cause third parties,\nincluding customers, to become unable to meet their obligations under various types of financial arrangements as\nwell as general disruptions or instability in the financial markets. Moreover, we have lost and may continue to\nlose customers as a result of such customers ceasing to do business, and we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience a material increase in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable\nfrom certain customers. These issues may continue in the future if current economic conditions continue or worsen.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles have and could continue to lengthen, and we could\nexperience greater deployment challenges.\nWe invest significant resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a\nsignificant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval\nrequirements, all of which have and may continue to lengthen our sales cycle. We have also faced and may in the\nfuture face unexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of our some or\nall aspects of our platform. Large organizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing\nconcessions, or require additional security management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort,\nand money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or\nthat these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial\nup-front investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front\nsales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be\nnegatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\na reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending budgets on our\ncompetitors' platforms, especially during periods of inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic environments;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and there are no assurances we will be able to maintain or increase\nprofitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend\nsignificant funds on our sales and marketing efforts to attract new customers, expand the number of licenses and\nservices used by our customers and develop and enhance our products. We also intend to continue investing in\ngeneral corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of\nother businesses, upgrading our infrastructure, addressing security and privacy issues, and expanding into new\ngeographies and markets. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur\nincreased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated with acquiring customers are generally\nincurred up front, while the subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which\ncan be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear basis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect,\nand we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in\ndecreased profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a\nresult of the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other\nunknown events. While free users continue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing\nprograms focused on converting free users to paid subscriptions. Some of these users have upgraded to a paid plan\nbut the remainder have not and may never do so. If we are unable to increase or sustain our profitability, the\nvalue of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict\nthe size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our platform, customer adoption and renewal of our\nplatform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive products and\nservices. As a result, we may not increase or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our\nrevenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control, and some of these third parties can make it more difficult for our platform to\ninteroperate with their systems in favor of competitive platforms. For example, given the broad adoption of\nMicrosoft Office and other productivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software.\nSeveral of our competitors own, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data\ncenter services, and other software, and also have material business relationships with companies that own,\ndevelop, operate, or distribute operating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware that our platform requires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent\nadvantages developing products and services that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms\nor those of their business partners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom One product integrates with tools offered by companies,\nsuch as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and expand on\nexisting and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are quality issues\nwith our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’ solutions, our\nbusiness will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our customer base and increase our revenue will\ndepend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and products; and\ninteroperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our customers\nmay require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. In particular, advancements in\ntechnology such as AI and machine learning are changing the way people work, and businesses that are slow to adopt\nthese new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. We invest significantly in research and development,\nand our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality and ease of adoption, enhance privacy and\nsecurity, and create organic demand for our platform. There is no assurance that new additions or other future\nenhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our\ncustomers or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If our research and development\ninvestments do not accurately anticipate demand or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies\ncustomer preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing\ncustomers or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings, such as AI-powered communication and collaboration tools, could make our platform\nobsolete or adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may experience\ndifficulties with software development, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development,\nintroduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features, or capabilities. We have in the past\nexperienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities and there can be no\nassurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any\ndelays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by users brought against\nus, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to our platform may require\nsubstantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful. If customers and users\ndo not widely adopt our\n19\nTable of Contents\nnew product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not perform as expected, we may not be able to\nrealize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop, license, or acquire new features and capabilities\nto our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nWe use generative AI including in our products and services, which may result in operational challenges, legal\nliability, reputational concerns, competitive risks and regulatory concerns that could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nWe use generative AI processes and algorithms, including by deploying generative AI features in our products and\nservices, which may result in adverse effects to our operations, legal liability, reputation and competitive risks.\nThe use of generative AI at scale is relatively new, and may lead to challenges, concerns and risks that are\nsignificant or that we may not be able to predict. For example, AI algorithms use machine learning (“ML”) and\npredictive analytics which may be insufficient, biased, inaccurate or of poor quality, which could result in\ncustomer rejection or skepticism of our products, adversely impact the rights of individuals, affect our reputation\nor brand, and negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, we could face claims from third parties\nclaiming infringement of their intellectual property or other proprietary rights with respect to materials used or\ncreated by generative AI tools or features that we believed to be available for use and not subject to such rights.\nThe investment required to bring AI features to market and the costs associated with providing these features to\nour customers may be significant, and we may be unable to recover these costs if customers and users do not widely\nadopt these features. Further, use of generative AI tools by our employees or others could result in disclosure of\nconfidential or sensitive company and customer data, reputational harm, and legal liability.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and services will\ndepend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue\nexpanding our sales and marketing capabilities, including through strategic partners, both domestically and\ninternationally. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing operations, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, as the cost to acquire\ncustomers through these efforts is high. Our business will be harmed if our efforts do not generate a\ncorrespondingly significant increase in revenue.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel\ntheir subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users has grown and their\nusage of communications capacity has increased, we have been required to make additional investments in network\ncapacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of\nwhich may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity does not continue to be available to us to support\nour user base in the future, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission\ncapacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third parties providing\ninternet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not have access to our\nplatform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new\ntechnologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased\ndemand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential\nusers to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid\nour platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, a regulatory regime generally referred to as network neutrality, subject\nto certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The order requires broadband providers to publicly\ndisclose accurate information regarding network management practices, performance characteristics, and commercial\nterms of their broadband internet access services sufficient to enable consumers to make informed choices regarding\nthe purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and\nmaintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial\nchallenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to the new rules, but reversed the FCC’s\ndecision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet service, requiring case-by-case\ndeterminations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC’s rules. The court also required the\nFCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to remain in effect, while the FCC conducts that\nreview. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that the three issues remanded by the court did\nnot provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order. On October 19, 2023, the FCC adopted a notice of\nproposed rulemaking that would reinstate the 2018 rules and asked for comment on that proposal and on potential\nchanges to those rules. We cannot predict whether or when the FCC will adopt new rules or the impact of any rules\nthat may be adopted on our operations or business.\nIn addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that\nwould regulate the conduct of broadband providers. After a federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary\ninjunction against California’s state-specific network neutrality law, California began enforcing that law on March\n25, 2021. A number of other states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions\nthat would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A similar law in Vermont is subject to a pending challenge,\nbut went into effect on April 20, 2022 and the challenge has been suspended until an appeal in another case\naddressing state powers to adopt internet regulation is resolved. We cannot predict whether the FCC order or other\nstate initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal\nlegislation, or the FCC. In addition, the status of state regimes may be affected by the FCC's action in its new\nnetwork neutrality proceeding. Under the FCC’s current rules, broadband internet access providers may be able to\ncharge web-based services such as ours for priority access or favor services offered by our competitors or by the\ninternet access providers themselves, which could result in increased costs and a loss of existing customers,\nimpair our ability to attract new customers, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur security measures, and those of third parties upon which we rely, have been compromised in the past and may be\ncompromised in the future. If our security measures are compromised in the future or if our information technology\nfails, this could harm our reputation, expose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our\nbusiness. In addition, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result\nin customers and users curtailing or ceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and\nour business being harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely collect, receive, store,\nprocess, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share\nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data, including data of ours, our customers, and our users, the data which\nincludes personal information, customer and user content, health-related data, intellectual property, trade\nsecrets, business plans, and financial information. We and the third parties upon which we rely face a variety of\nevolving threats, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, which could cause security incidents. Security\nincidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information.\nCyberattacks, other malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities\nthreaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data and\ninformation technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. Cloud-based platform providers\nof products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. Threats are prevalent and continue\nto rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer\n“hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or\nmisuse), sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced persistent threat intrusions.\nSome actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-\nstate actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During\ntimes of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a\nheightened risk of these attacks, which could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and\nability to provide our services. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to\nsocial-engineering attacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as\nfake, and phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced\npersistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing,\n21\nTable of Contents\npersonnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware\nfailures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, attacks\nenhanced or facilitated by AI, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including\nthose perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are\nbecoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations or our\nability to provide our products or services, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds.\nExtortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to\nmake such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Additionally, our\nplatform, products, and services are relied on by a large number of companies worldwide and as a result, if our\nplatform, products, or solutions are compromised, a significant number or all of our customers and their data could\nbe simultaneously affected. The potential liability and associated consequences we could suffer as a result of such\na large-scale event could be catastrophic and result in irreparable harm.\nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional\ncybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in\nacquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were\nnot found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate\ncompanies into our information technology environment and security program.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and\nvulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to our business operations. We rely on third-\nparty service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process confidential, proprietary,\nand sensitive data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center\nfacilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, and other\nfunctions. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services and parts, or\notherwise to operate our business. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is\nlimited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-party\nservice providers experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences.\nWhile we may be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-\nrelated obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such\naward. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that\nthird parties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been\ncompromised.\nIf our security measures are compromised, our reputation could be damaged; our data, information or intellectual\nproperty, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised; our business may be harmed;\nand we could incur significant liability. We take steps designed to detect and remediate vulnerabilities in our\ninformation systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely, but we may not detect or remediate all such\nvulnerabilities or do so in a timely manner. The threats and techniques used to exploit vulnerabilities change\nfrequently and are often sophisticated in nature, and may be difficult to detect by security tools. Vulnerabilities\ncould be exploited and result in a security incident. We have limited budgetary and human resources for detecting\nand remediating vulnerabilities and have experienced difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified security\npersonnel, especially after our recent restructuring actions. We may experience delays in developing and deploying\nremedial measures, including patches, designed to address identified vulnerabilities, and our remedial measures may\nrequire action by our customers such as installing patches or updates, which may increase the amount of time a\nvulnerability remains unremediated. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future to\nanticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our information systems or\nthird-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems.\nIn addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to\nactively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may\nincrease because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications\nand collaboration platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced. For example,\nin July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the Zoom Meeting platform,\nincluding certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software addressing these\nvulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by these\nvulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and their\nsoftware is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security researcher\nreported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized person to\ngain root access to a user’s system. Given the nature of our business and operations, our products and services\nwill inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects that have not been identified or remediated\nand cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We have identified high or critical vulnerabilities in our\nproducts, services and information systems in the past, and we expect that we will continue to identify such\nvulnerabilities in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to address any vulnerabilities in our\nproducts,\n22\nTable of Contents\nservices and information systems that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in developing\npatches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities.\nWe will continue to make prioritization decisions based on, among other things, our available resources, the\nefficacy of our security tools, and the increasing workload to meet certain security obligations, to determine\nwhich vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit\nthat compromises security. In some cases, customers are responsible for installing our software updates, and until\nthey do so, their service remains subject to the vulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities\nand critical security defects, errors in remediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party\nproviders to remediate vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or\ndeciding not to install software updates could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or\notherwise harm our business. Security incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data\nprotection, and information security may also prevent some of our customers and users from using or cause some of\nour customers and users to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their subscriptions. Failures to\nmeet customers’ and users’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality of their data and information\ncould damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and users, attract new customers and users,\nand grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or security vulnerabilities could result in breaches of\nour agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including class action litigation), regulatory investigations\nor actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the effects of such an event or\nvulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in customer and user trust, increases in\ninsurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to address cybersecurity issues, and attempts to\nprevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and settlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business\nand our reputation because of any such incident.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that\ncould result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration,\nencryption, disclosure of, or access to confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data or our information technology\nsystems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt\nour ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services. We may expend significant\nresources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain\nprivacy, data protection, and information security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific\nsecurity measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology\nsystems and sensitive data.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents, including\nthose recently promulgated by the SEC. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data\nbreach is costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches.\nActual or perceived security gaps or security compromises experienced in our industry or by our competitors, our\ncustomers, a third party upon whom we rely, or us could cause us to experience adverse consequences, such as\ngovernment enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional\nreporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal\ninformation); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational\nharm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including\navailability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may\ncause customers to stop using our services, deter new customers from using our services, and negatively impact our\nability to grow and operate our business.\nIn addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States, like many similarly situated\ntechnology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel outside of the United States,\nincluding in China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as\nmarket and media scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy\nfeatures.\nIncreased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand has led\nand could in the future lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our\ninformation security and potential vulnerabilities associated with our platform. For example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading to challenges for users who\ndid not have full IT support or established protocols for security and privacy like our larger customers. As a\nresult, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and security and privacy issues,\nincluding on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in material reputational harm, a loss\nof customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure, additional expenses, and other harm\nto our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use\nor other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or\ndamages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance\ncoverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor will be available in sufficient amounts\n23\nTable of Contents\nto cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful\nassertion of one or more large claims against us that are not covered or exceed available insurance coverage, or\nthe occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large\ndeductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our business.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers and users\nand, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications and\ncollaboration platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users view the Zoom brand primarily\nas a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform that connects people through video,\nvoice, chat and content sharing, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market\nposition may be detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive,\nmaintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or\nperception of our platform, including from any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints\nstemming from increased usage, from our privacy or security features, because of sentiment towards the providers of\ncommunication and collaboration technologies generally, or from our integration of new product functionalities\nusing technologies with heightened public interest, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to\nattract and retain customers. Similarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or\nperceived violation by our employees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause\nus reputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our\nbusiness, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public\nperception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nharmed.\nWhile our employee headcount both in the United States and internationally has generally increased over time, we\nhave undertaken, and may undertake from time to time in the future, restructuring actions to better align our\nfinancial model and. For example, in February 2023, we commenced certain restructuring actions, designed to reduce\noperating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth.\nThese organizational changes may not achieve or sustain the targeted benefits, or the benefits, even if achieved,\nmay not be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations. Steps we take to manage our\nbusiness operations, including workplace policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies\nfor future growth, may adversely affect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate\nhighly skilled personnel. Additionally, while we expect to continue to grow our business and operations over time,\nwe have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by\ngrowing companies in rapidly changing industries. Our ability to manage our growth and business operations\neffectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require\nus to continue to expend resources to continue to support our global user-base and to retain, attract, train,\nmotivate and manage employees. This places a continuous, significant strain on our management, operational, and\nfinancial resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if\nwe are not able to accurately forecast future growth, our business would be harmed.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing customers and make it more difficult to attract new customers;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. Such changes may result in\na loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to\nwork together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover\nor otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all, which may be exacerbated by our recent restructuring actions and any\nsimilar future actions. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to\naddress a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely\nmanner. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience employee turnover as a result of our recent\nrestructuring actions. New hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity. New\nemployees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of\nqualified individuals. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel,\nour business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. We must also continue to retain and motivate existing employees through our compensation\npractices, company culture, and career development opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain\nour current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\n25\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering (“IPO”), employees joining us at\ndifferent times could have significant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business. Further, the volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less\nattractive to current and potential employees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in\nhiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 28.7% and 30.5%, and\n33.3% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We plan to add\nlocal sales support in further select international markets over time. Our customers include multinational\ncorporations with global users, and we expect to continue to expand our international operations, which includes\nopening offices in new jurisdictions and providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of\nthese multinational corporations. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our\nservices or sell subscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. If we are not able to satisfy certain\ngovernment- and industry-specific requirements, we have in the past and may in the future experience service\noutages or other adverse consequences, including interference with our local operations or restrictions on our\nability to continue our operations in certain jurisdictions, that would impair our ability to operate or expand\nfurther into certain markets. As an example, if local or national Chinese government agencies interfered with or\nplaced restrictions on our research and development operations in China, our ability to design new products,\nfeatures, and functionality on a timely basis or at all, or our ability to effectively deliver our services, would\nbe adversely impacted as a significant portion of our research and development organization resides in China. In\naddition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally in the future requires\nconsiderable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly\ngrowing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems,\nalternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international expansion will require investment of\nsignificant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to recruiting and retaining talented and capable\nemployees outside the United States, including complying with complex employment- and compensation-related laws,\nregulations, and practices in these international jurisdictions, and maintaining our company culture across all of\nour offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to employees in certain countries outside of the\nUnited States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations. This may require us to offer equally\ncompelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash compensation plans or increased\nshort-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees in these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and increases risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, automatic\nrenewals, and unsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees\nif our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices or develop new products, features, and functionality;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our intellectual property that resides outside of the United States, such as\nthe risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual property outside of the\nforeign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\n26\nTable of Contents\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the continuing deterioration in diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and China, the conflict in Israel and the surrounding area, and the continuing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary environments, recent\nbank failures and related uncertainties, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, weighing on our\ncustomers' ability to pay for our service on a timely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nAs described above, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, European\nUnion, and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus. Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian\nfinancial institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or\nthe SWIFT, payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be\ntaken in future, by the United States, NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could\nresult in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new\nbusiness opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. In addition, legal requirements in the United States and other\ncountries may come into conflict with each other making it challenging or impossible to comply with both countries’\nlegal requirements simultaneously. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal\npenalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and regulations\nor manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in\ncertain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, and any failure to comply with such laws\ncould harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-bribery and\nanti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees and\nintermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to\ngovernment officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public companies to make\nand keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of\nanti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to expand our international\npresence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nGeopolitical tension between the United States and China, or between other countries, such as Taiwan, and China,\nmay intensify and lead to increased scrutiny of our business operations in China.\nWe have a significant number of employees, primarily engineers, in China, where personnel costs are less expensive\nthan in many other geographies. The number or proportion of our employees in China has fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including macroeconomic changes and internal restructuring.\nGeopolitical and national security tensions between the United States and China, or between other countries and\nChina, have in the past, currently are and could in the future lead to increased scrutiny of our business\noperations in China and a negative perception among current and potential customers regarding our collection, use,\nstorage, disclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies, any of which may harm our\nreputation and business. Additionally, we may face certain adverse consequences, as a\n27\nTable of Contents\nresult of geopolitical and national security tensions between the United States and China, including interference\nwith, or restrictions on, our local operations that would impair our ability to operate in China. As an example, if\nlocal or national Chinese government agencies interfered with or placed restrictions on our research and\ndevelopment operations in China, our ability to design new products, features, and functionality on a timely basis\nor at all, or our ability to effectively deliver our service, would be adversely impacted as a significant portion\nof our research and development organization resides in China.\nIn June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took responding to law enforcement requests from the Chinese\ngovernment. The NDCA subpoena also requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between\nour employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any\nforeign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United\nStates. We are fully cooperating with these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal\ninvestigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we\nwill ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We\ncannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could\ncause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm,\na loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and users could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced plan must be recognized\nover the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and users may harm our relationships with our customers\nand users and, consequently, our business.\nIncreased user demand for support may result in increased costs that may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, during the COVID-19 pandemic we saw surging demand requiring us to allocate additional resources to\nsupport our expanded customer and user base, including many who were using our platform for the first time, placing\nadditional pressure on our support organization. In addition, as we continue to support our global user base, we\nneed to be able to continue to provide efficient support that meets our customers and users’ needs globally at\nscale. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we need to hire additional\nsupport personnel, our business may be harmed. Our new customer signups are highly dependent on our business\nreputation and on recommendations from our existing customers and users. Any failure to maintain high-quality\nsupport, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and users, would\nharm our business.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our resellers or potential resellers to\nfavor their products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology, product\n28\nTable of Contents\nofferings and processes requires significant time and resources. For resellers in certain emerging markets, we may\nbe unable to effectively oversee and quality check certain processes, such as customer due diligence, which has and\nmay continue to impact such resellers’ ability to implement robust customer verification protocols and mitigate\nfraud risk.If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to scale and\nimprove our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and training. Many\nresellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to effectively sell our\nplatform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, develop relationships with new resellers in new\nmarkets, expand the number of resellers in existing markets, or manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to\nour existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of new customers and increase sales to existing\ncustomers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our business.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nportion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the\ncurrencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024,\n2023, and 2022, 19.3%, 20.0%, and 22.6% of our revenue, respectively, and 13.7%, 10.8%, and 16.8% of our expenses,\nrespectively, were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies\nother than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure\nto fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and\nearnings and could materially impact our results of operations. For example, for the fiscal year ended January 31,\n2024, our total revenue was lower than anticipated in part due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We do not\ncurrently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to continue selling our products and services to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency\ncustomers, which may occur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers\nand/or through direct sales to government entities. While we are a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) authorized SaaS service, selling to government entities and other government contractors\npresents a number of unique challenges and risks including the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that are less favorable than what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould expect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability\nunder the civil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\nand\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced, among other things, by public sector budgetary\ncycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector\ndemand for our products.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the\n29\nTable of Contents\nU.S. federal government. Software developers will be required to provide visibility into their software and make\nsecurity data publicly available. Due to this Executive Order, federal agencies may require us to modify our\ncybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our compliance costs. If we are unable to meet the\nrequirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the U.S. government may be impaired and may result in\na loss of revenue.\nOur current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and users or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and users and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing platform or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, have attracted and may in the future\nattract negative attention if they involve technologies with heightened public interest, may fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and users or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New\nproducts may initially suffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market\nand sell such products to new and existing customers. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our\nproducts, or the introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products\nfail to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current platform, as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate\ncarriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that\nwill use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our\nmargins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the future\nmay similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third parties, all of which would lower our profit margins for\nany such new products. If this trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could\nharm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid user base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses;\nchanges in tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use,\ndeferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples, changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other\nfundamental changes in tax law currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash\ntax liabilities but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later\nyears, we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. Absent a change in\nlegislation, we expect the mandatory capitalization requirement will continue to have a material impact on our cash\nflows.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue derived from digital\nservices. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of the OECD's\nInclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing\nour future tax obligations.\nThe OECD has also been working on a Base Erosion and Profits Shifting project that, upon implementation, would\nchange various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\ncountries in which we operate. In this regard, the OECD has proposed policies aiming to modernize global tax\nsystems, including a country-by-country 15% minimum effective tax rate (“Pillar Two”) for multinational companies.\nNumerous countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation to implement the Pillar Two model\nrules with a subset of the rules becoming effective during our fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, and the\nremaining rules becoming effective for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2026, or in later periods. At this point\nin time, we do not expect material tax impacts associated with Pillar Two rules in the countries where we operate\nfor the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. As these rules continue to evolve with new legislation and guidance,\nwe will continue to monitor and account for the enactment of Pillar Two rules in the countries where we operate,\nand the potential impacts such rules may have on our effective tax rate and cash flows in future years.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, due to, among other things, possible delays and\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approvals. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our\ncompetitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users,\ndevelopers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or\neffectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our\nacquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our company, the results of\noperations of the combined company could be adversely affected. The process of acquiring a business, including any\nintegration efforts, requires significant time and resources, requires significant attention from management, and\ncan disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully,\nwhich could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and\naccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a\n31\nTable of Contents\nlimited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our future\nresults of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and\nmodel future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future\nperformance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could continue to slow or our revenue could decline for\na number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition; contraction of our\noverall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for capacity constraints; or\nour failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities or to adapt and respond to inflationary factors\naffecting our business or future economic recession. The changes the COVID-19 pandemic fostered on the way\ncompanies operate, including the shifts to remote and hybrid work have limited our ability to forecast revenue,\ncosts, and expenses due to the uncertainty around how companies choose to operate in the future, including the\nimpacts of a remote and hybrid workplace. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently\nexperienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described\nherein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are\nincorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nlaws and regulations, industry standards, policies, and contractual obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, information security, and other matters could harm our reputation and business and subject us to\nsignificant fines and liability.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make\naccessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information,\nincluding personal data, customer and user content, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, third-\nparty data, business plans, transactions, financial information Our data processing activities subject us to\nnumerous privacy, data protection, and information security obligations, such as various laws, regulations,\nguidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements.\nLaws in the United States\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection\nlaws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For\nexample, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020\n(“CPRA”) (collectively, “CCPA”) applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives, and\nemployees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of\nCalifornia residents to exercise certain privacy rights, such as those noted below. The CCPA provides for fines of\nup to $7,500 per intentional violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover\nsignificant statutory damages. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\nand local levels and we expect more states to pass similar laws in the future. These developments may further\ncomplicate compliance efforts and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom\nwe rely. Under various laws and other obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, we\nmay be required to obtain certain consents to process personal information. For example, some of our data\nprocessing practices may be challenged under wiretapping laws if we obtain consumer information from third parties\nthrough various methods, including chatbot and session replay providers, or via third-party marketing pixels. These\npractices may be subject to increased challenges by class action plaintiffs. Our inability or failure to obtain\nconsent for these practices could result in adverse consequences, including class action litigation and mass\narbitration demands.\nLaws Outside of the United States\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards related to privacy,\ndata protection, and information security may govern. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (“EU\n32\nTable of Contents\nGDPR”), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (“UK GDPR”), Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados\nPessoais, or “LGPD”) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”) impose strict\nrequirements for processing personal information. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies may face temporary or\ndefinitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million Euros under the EU GDPR\nand 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR, or 4% of annual global revenue, in each case, whichever is\ngreater; or private litigation related to processing of personal information brought by classes of data subjects or\nconsumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. The Swiss Federal Act on Data\nProtection (“FADP”), also applies to the collection and processing of personal information, including health-\nrelated information, by companies located in Switzerland, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside\nof Switzerland. The FADP has been revised and adopted by the Swiss Parliament. Companies must comply with the\nrevised version of the FADP and its revised ordinances from September 1, 2023, which may result in an increase of\ncosts of compliance, risks of noncompliance and penalties for noncompliance.\nWe also target customers in Asia and have operations in Japan, Singapore and India, and may be subject to new and\nemerging privacy, data protection, and information security regimes in the region, including Japan’s Act on the\nProtection of Personal Information, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act, and India's new privacy legislation,\nthe Digital Personal Data Protection Act.\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal information from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United\nStates or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe\nand other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal\ninformation to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”)\nhave significantly restricted the transfer of personal information to the United States and other countries whose\nprivacy laws they generally believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent\ninterpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently\nvarious mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal information from the EEA and UK to the United States in\ncompliance with law, such as the EEA’s standard contractual clause, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the\nUK extension thereto (which allow for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance\nand participate in the Framework), these mechanisms can be subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance\nthat we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal information to the United States.\nIf there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions\nto the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face\nsignificant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate\npart of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense,\nincreased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work\nwith partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal\ninformation necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal information out of\nthe EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from\nregulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to\nsuspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal information out of Europe for allegedly violating the EU\nGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations. For example, in May 2023, the Irish Data Protection Commission\ndetermined that a major social media company’s use of the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal\ninformation from Europe to the United States was insufficient and levied a 1.2 billion Euro fine against the\ncompany and prohibited the company from transferring personal information to the United States.\nArtificial Intelligence\nOur development and use of AI and machine learning (“ML”) technologies is subject to privacy, data protection, IP,\nand information security laws, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and\ncontractual requirements, as well as increasing regulation and scrutiny. Several jurisdictions around the globe,\nincluding the EU, the UK and certain U.S. states, have proposed, enacted, or are considering laws governing the\ndevelopment and use of AI/ML. In the EU, regulators have reached political agreement on the text of the Artificial\nIntelligence Act, which, when adopted and in force, will have a direct effect across all EU jurisdictions and could\nimpose onerous obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. Obligations on AI/ML may make it harder for us\nto conduct our business using, or build products incorporating, AI/ML, require us to change our business practices,\nrequire us to retrain our algorithms, or prevent or limit our use of AI/ML. For example, the FTC has required other\ncompanies to turn over (or disgorge) valuable insights or trainings generated through the use of AI/ML where they\nallege the company has violated privacy and consumer protection laws. Additionally, certain privacy laws extend\nrights to consumers (such as the right to delete certain personal information) and regulate automated decision\nmaking, which may be incompatible with our use of AI/ML. If we do not develop or incorporate AI/ML in a manner\nconsistent with these factors, and consistent with customer expectations, it may result in an adverse impact to our\nreputation, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Similarly, if customers\nand users do not widely adopt our new product AI/ML experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not perform\nas expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment.\n33\nTable of Contents\nLaws Relating to Minors\nAdditionally, regulators are increasingly scrutinizing companies that process minors' data and/or provide online\nservices or other interactive platforms used by minors. Numerous laws, regulations, and legally-binding codes, such\nas the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), California’s Age Appropriate Design Code, the CCPA,\nother U.S. state comprehensive privacy laws, the EU and UK GDPR, the EU's Digital Services Act (\"DSA\"), the UK's\nOnline Safety Act (\"OSA\") and the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, impose various obligations on companies that\nprocess minors' data and/or provide online services, or other interactive platforms used by children, including\nprohibiting showing minors advertising, requiring age verification, limiting the use of minors’ personal\ninformation, requiring certain consents to process such data and extending certain rights to children and their\nparents with respect to that data. These laws may, or in some cases already have been subject to legal challenges\nand changing interpretations which may further complicate our efforts to comply with laws applicable to us. Some of\nthese obligations have wide ranging applications, including for services that do not intentionally target child\nusers (defined in some circumstances as a user under the age of 18 years old). In particular, COPPA is a U.S.\nFederal law that applies to operators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under\nthe age of 13 that collect personal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with\nactual knowledge that they are collecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide\nvideo communications and collaboration services to schools, school districts, and school systems to support\ntraditional, virtual, and hybrid classrooms, distance learning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other\nservices. As part of these services, Zoom may be used by students, including students under the age of 13, and we\ncollect personal information from such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must\ncontractually consent to Zoom’s information practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services.\nIf we fail to accurately anticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of these laws,\nregulations, and legally-binding codes, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing\nrestrictions, litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any\nsuch failures, we could be in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in\nus, which could harm our reputation and business.\nConsumer Preferences and Protection\nIndividuals are increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver\ntargeted advertising. Third-party platforms have introduced (or plan to introduce) measures to provide users with\nmore privacy controls over targeted advertising activities, and regulators (including in the EEA/UK) are heavily\nscrutinizing the use of technologies used to deliver such advertisements. Major technology platforms on which we\nrely to gather information about consumers have adopted or proposed measures to provide consumers with additional\ncontrol over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information for targeted advertising or other\npurposes. For example, in 2021, Apple began allowing users to more easily opt-out of activity tracking across\ndevices. In February 2022, Google announced similar plans to adopt additional privacy controls on its Android\ndevices to allow users to limit sharing of their data with third parties and reduce cross-device tracking for\nadvertising purposes. Additionally, Google has announced that it intends to phase out third-party cookies in its\nChrome browser, which could make it more difficult for us to target advertisements. Other browsers, such as Firefox\nand Safari, have already adopted similar measures. In addition, legislative proposals and present laws and\nregulations regulate the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing.\nFor example, in the EEA and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to\nthe targeted advertising ecosystem. European regulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances\nwhere the regulators alleged that appropriate consent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising\nactivities. In the EU, it is anticipated that the ePrivacy Regulation and national implementing laws will replace\nthe current national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive, which may require us to make significant operational\nchanges. In the United States, the CCPA, for example, grants California residents the right to opt-out of a\ncompany’s sharing of personal information for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable\nconsideration, and requires covered businesses to honor user-enabled browser signals from the Global Privacy\nControl. Partially as a result of these developments, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the\ncollection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver targeted advertising or other types of tracking.\nIndividuals are now more aware of options related to consent, “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals\nfrom the Global Privacy Control), and “ad-blocking” software to prevent the collection of their personal\ninformation for targeted advertising purposes. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our\nproducts, and any of these developments or changes could materially impair our ability to reach new or existing\ncustomers or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future become the\nsubject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices, including\nour subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or applied by\nregulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur fines,\npenalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIndustry Standards\nIn addition to privacy, data protection and information security laws, we are contractually subject to industry\nstandards adopted by industry groups and may become subject to such obligations in the future. We may also have\nprivacy, data protection, information security obligations arising from the practices in our industry or of\ncompanies similar to us. We are also bound by other contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection,\nand information security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. If we fall below\nsuch industry standard or cannot comply with such contractual obligations, our reputation and business may be\nharmed. We also publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements, such as compliance with\ncertain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding privacy, data protection, and information security.\nIf these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair,\nor misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or\nother adverse consequences.\nGovernment Inquiries and Investigations\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nIn June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign political\nparties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user data, the\ndevelopment and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took responding to law enforcement\nrequests from the Chinese government. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various\nsecurity, data protection, and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as\nwell as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks\ninformation relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any\nattempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as\nthey relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking\nrelated information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own\nthorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed,\nwhich facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or\nmay not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these\nmatters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material\nreputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our\nbusiness.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nConsents\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our\n35\nTable of Contents\nservices and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability\nto store and process user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nPublic Perception\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand has led to greater public scrutiny\nof, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage, disclosure, and processing of\npersonal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and customers, particularly those\nthat are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their own IT controls like those of\na larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with control over user settings. This\nhas resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by malicious actors. Additional\nunfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation\nexposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, additional\nexpenses and other harm to our business.\nFailure to Comply with our Obligations\nObligations related to privacy, data protection, information security, the use of AI, the provision of online\nservices and other interactive platforms (and consumers' expectations regarding them) are quickly changing,\nbecoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to\ndiffering applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing\nfor and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to\nour services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process\npersonal information on our behalf.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our obligations relating to\nprivacy, data protection, information security, the use of AI and the provision of online services and other\ninteractive platforms. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to\ncomply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties on\nwhich we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable privacy, data protection,\nand information security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to:\ngovernment enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar);\nlitigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting requirements and/or\noversight; bans on processing personal information; and orders to destroy or not use personal information. In\nparticular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies,\nincluding class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory\ndamages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending\non the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our\nreputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; inability to process\npersonal information or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our\nproducts; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial\nchanges to our business model or operations.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, the Trump administration had\nthreatened tougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The direct and indirect effects of\ntariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China\neconomic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of\ngovernmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions\nand further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China,\ncould result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade\nrestrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken\nby the Biden administration or future administration with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United\nStates and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by\nthe other countries in retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between the United States and China\ncould exacerbate these actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the implementation of China’s\nnational-security law in Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the\nrisks associated with the business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to\nour business strategy or operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-\nconsuming and expensive, and certain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or react to these\nchanges.\n36\nTable of Contents\nFurther, in recent years, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and\ncommunications technology and services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions.\nIn May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to\nimplement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national\nsecurity risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to\ncontracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce\nissued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS transactions that pose a national\nsecurity risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as China. Several aspects of this rule\nremain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule will be implemented and enforced in\npractice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement\nfurther restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty\nregarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will\nsuccessfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the\nexecutive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business,\nincluding in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced\nsales.\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations that are subject\nto varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as ours,\nuncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional taxes,\nfees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical presence\nor “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales of our\nplatform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus for\nsales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we have in the past\ninadvertently made and may inadvertently make our software products available to some customers in potential\nviolation of the EAR. Therefore, as warranted, we may submit voluntary self-disclosures regarding compliance with\nU.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security (“BIS”). For instance, in March 2022, we submitted a voluntary self-disclosure to BIS\nregarding our compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and regulations, which BIS closed out with a warning\nletter with no referral for criminal or administrative prosecution, and no imposition of monetary fines or\npenalties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the\n37\nTable of Contents\nenforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies\ntargeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or in our decreased ability to export or\nsell our platform to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our\nplatform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would likely harm our business.\nWe may be subject to, or respond to requests from law enforcement in connection with enforcement of, a variety of\nU.S. and international laws that could result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our\nbusiness due to changes in the laws, changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws,\nor investigations into compliance with the laws.\nWe may be subject to, or respond to requests from law enforcement that are legally valid, appropriately scoped, and\nsufficiently detailed in connection with enforcement of, various civil and criminal laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to protect user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. Our trust and safety team may take further action as appropriate,\nincluding suspension or termination of the participant's account or referral to law enforcement. The laws in this\narea are currently in a state of flux and vary widely between jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that\nin the future we and our competitors may be subject to legal actions along with the users who shared such content.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal liability we may face, our reputation could be harmed should there be an\nincident generating extensive negative publicity about the content shared on our platform. Such publicity would\nharm our business.\nChanges in law or policy could compel us or limit our ability to engage in content moderation, or otherwise limit\nthe ability of users to engage in inappropriate or harmful behavior, and could expose us to liability.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 provides\nprotection for providers of online service from liability for content produced by third parties and protects the\nright to engage in moderation of user content. President Biden and many Members of Congress from both parties\nsupport the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional action remains. In addition, the\nFCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to adopt rules interpreting Section 230, which\nlimits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that is transmitted via those platforms and for\ngood-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a vote on that proposal, and the FCC has not\nreleased any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The Democratic members of the FCC have indicated\nthat they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of the FCC. There is no schedule for action by the\nFCC on the petition. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or the FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be\nafforded the same level of protection offered by Section 230. In addition, there are pending cases before the\njudiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to internet platforms, including a lawsuit by\nformer President Trump that, if successful, would greatly limit the scope of Section 230. The U.S. Supreme Court\nrecently declined to limit the applicability of Section 230 in certain circumstances, but future cases may not\nyield the same results. These various efforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the\nrisks faced by internet-based businesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted\nagainst us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims.\nIf we are found liable for our customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or\npenalties, redesign business methods, or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions\nand to avoid future liability.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas that is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses\noperating on the Internet to moderate user-generated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections\ngranted under Section 230. Similar legislation has been introduced in other states in 2022, including a bill that\nhas passed the Georgia State Senate and is pending before the Georgia House. Implementation of the Florida and\nTexas statutes has been stayed by various federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 18, the\nparties in the Florida case requested, and were granted, a stay of the appeals court mandate pending Supreme Court\nreview. On September 16, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision upholding the\nTexas law. On September 30, the parties in that case filed an unopposed motion to stay the Fifth Circuit decision\npending Supreme Court review, and the Fifth Circuit granted that request on October 13, 2022. On September 29,\n2023, the Supreme Court announced that would review both the Florida and Texas decisions. A Supreme Court decision\nis expected during the first half of 2024. Florida recently amended its statute in an effort to address issues that\nled the court to issue the stay. It is likely that any other such state legislation also would be challenged under\nthe First\n38\nTable of Contents\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it is preempted by Section 230. We cannot predict whether\nany such state legislation will be adopted, enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nFurthermore, new laws and regulations have been enacted or are being considered that impose extensive obligations\nregarding online safety and the operation of online services or platforms, such as the OSA and DSA, which may\nincrease our compliance costs, require changes to our processes, operations, and business practices. For example,\nthese new laws and regulations may seek to regulate the sharing of user‑generated content and require us to\nidentify, mitigate, and manage the risks of harm to users from illegal or harmful content. Violating these\nobligations could carry significant consequences. For example, violating the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of\ntotal annual worldwide revenue and violating the OSA can result in audits, inspections, and fines of up to £18\nmillion or 10% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In\naddition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nAs described above, the FCC could reinstate its prior network neutrality regulations or adopt new regulations. See\nPart 1A. Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential\nusers to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform. Changes in FCC regulation of the internet and internet-based\nservices also could impose new regulatory obligations on our other services. Such action could result in extension\nof common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the ones we offer. The imposition of\ncommon carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to modify our service offerings to\ncomply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation could result in substantial fines\nand penalties and other sanctions.\nOn December 13, 2023, the FCC adopted revised rules on reporting of breaches of private customer information, known\nas CPNI. The revised rules could broaden the types of CPNI breaches that must be reported, but also could limit the\nnumber of reports that must be filed by adopting a minimum threshold for the number of customers affected and not\nrequiring reporting in certain circumstances when customers are not harmed. The rules also require that breach\nreports be provided directly to the FCC, which could increase the risk of enforcement action, including fines and\nbehavioral remedies. These rules are not yet in effect.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that prohibit Chinese companies that are deemed to be a national security risk by other\nfederal agencies from obtaining new authorizations and placed on a list known as the Covered List to sell\ntelecommunications equipment in the U.S. and is considering proposed rules that would ban those companies from\nselling previously-authorized equipment or could prohibit use of their equipment in the U.S. Zoom does not\ncurrently have any equipment from the companies subject to the ban in its network, but if other companies are added\nto the Covered List and the FCC adopts rules that ban sales or use of equipment from such companies, we could be\nrequired to find new sources for similar equipment or replace existing equipment entirely.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer. The California Public Utilities Commission is now taking the position\nthat it can require VoIP providers like Zoom Phone to obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass\nUSF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in\nour products becoming more expensive. We expect that state\n39\nTable of Contents\npublic utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to services\nlike Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our business, we\ncould be subject to substantial fines and penalties, and we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit\ncertain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nCertain states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the\nconduct of broadband providers. California’s state-specific network neutrality law has taken effect and Vermont’s\nlaw took effect, but a challenge to that law remains pending. We cannot predict whether other state initiatives\nwill be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every\nsignificant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an\nimportant factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately\nprotect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in\nthose trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may\nknowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third parties may challenge our proprietary right; our\npending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to\nprevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the\ndevelopment of our proprietary\n40\nTable of Contents\ntechnologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part\non trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These\nagreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate\nremedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently\ndiscover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar\ntechnologies and processes. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of\nprotection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade\nsecrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain\ncountries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending\nour intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of\ntheft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including\ntechnical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our\nintellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial\nadvantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary\nto enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is\ninadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible\nassets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features.\nAny of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed\nsoftware. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open source\nsoftware and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we could be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could\ncause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations\nin the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n41\nTable of Contents\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral political, social, economic and market conditions, in both domestic and our foreign markets, including\neffects of increased interest rates and inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020 and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2024, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 64.1% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n56.8% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2024, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.4% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 31.0% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one\nshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or\nincapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing\nservices to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of\nthe then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary\nof the closing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our\n42\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable\nfuture, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\n43\nTable of Contents\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications and collaboration platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using\nlegacy communication methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product\nfeature that every customer or user wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform\ndoes not provide. The variables that go into\n44\nTable of Contents\nthe calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any\nparticular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our\nsolutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the markets in which we compete meet\nthe size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons outside of our\ncontrol, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm our business and\nprospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health\ndevelopments could have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could\ninclude business and service disruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our\nemployees' ability to travel to support our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In\naddition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market\ndata. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an\nexit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are currently depressed and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the\ncompanies we have invested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are\ninherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and\ntiming of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to\nmitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for\na set period of time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment\ncapital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies\ncould be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, particularly\n45\nTable of Contents\nduring times of market volatility and general economic instability. The need for additional liquidity may also be\naffected by the federal government’s potential failure to raise the debt ceiling or correct a prolonged banking or\nfinancial crisis. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt securities,\nthose securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common stock, and\nour stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources in our accounting, legal and IT organizations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Recently, the SEC has alleged violations of internal controls\nat other public companies, even in the absence of an underlying accounting or disclosure violation, which\nsignificantly increases the enforcement risk faced by us and other public companies for any weaknesses in\ndisclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting.\nIneffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause\ninvestors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative\neffect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these\nrequirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual\nmanagement report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\nRegulators', investors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social\nand governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, customers and other stakeholders concerning environmental,\nsocial and governance matters (“ESG”). Regulators are driving legislation to bring consistency and transparency to\nESG disclosures. Some investors may use these ESG performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in\nsome cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to ESG are inadequate.\nWe may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the ESG standards set by various constituencies.\nOur voluntary ESG and climate disclosures, as well as our reporting under related disclosure regulations, or a\nfailure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG reporting and practices, may potentially harm our\nreputation and customer relationships or expose us to liability. Due to new regulatory standards and market\nstandards, certain new or existing customers may impose stricter ESG guidelines or contractual language for, and\nmay scrutinize relationships more closely with, their counterparties, including us, which may lengthen sales cycles\nor increase our costs.\nFurthermore, if our competitors’ ESG performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current\ninvestors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain\ninitiatives or goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such\ninitiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change (such as drought, wildfires,\nhurricanes, increased storm severity and sea level rise), we recognize that there are inherent climate-related\nrisks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate\nchange. For example, certain of our offices have experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-\nrelated events at an increasing frequency, including drought, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality\nimpacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Changing market dynamics, global policy\ndevelopments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the\nU.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers and the\nbusiness of our customers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain or resume\noperations. In addition, we may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements, standards or\nexpectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business."

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have designed and implemented an information security program that is tailored to our operations and\ninfrastructure, the nature of our products and services, and the sensitivity of data. Our information security\nprogram consists of processes that are designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats.\nWe have implemented cybersecurity risk management processes that include, for example, vulnerability assessments,\napplication security assessments, penetration testing, third party security assessments, security audits, and\nongoing risk assessments. In addition, we have implemented technical, physical, and organizational safeguards\ndesigned to mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats, including, for example, depending on the\nenvironment or system: information security policies and standards, data protection policies and standards,\nsecurity training and awareness campaigns, information protection processes, and systems monitoring for\ncybersecurity threats. We have also implemented an Incident Response Plan and procedures that provide a framework\nfor responding to cybersecurity incidents. The Incident Response Plan and procedures provide protocols for incident\nevaluation, including the use of third-party service providers, processes for notification, and internal escalation\nof information to our senior management and the appropriate Board committee(s). The Incident Response Plan is\nreviewed and updated, as necessary, under the leadership of Zoom’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”).\nFurther, our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are an important element of our\noverall enterprise risk management program and included in our annual enterprise risk assessment which we provide\nto senior management and the Board.\nWe use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats, including for example: professional services firms (including legal counsel), threat\nintelligence service providers, cybersecurity consultants, cybersecurity software and managed service providers,\npenetration testing firms, and forensic investigators.\nWe have a third party risk management program designed to oversee, identify, and mitigate material risks from\ncybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers. We perform risk-based due diligence\nand ongoing monitoring of third parties, which may include, for example: reviewing the third party’s relevant\nsecurity audits and assessments; conducting our own security assessments, and imposing contractual obligations\nrelated to information security.\nFor a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Board addresses our cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. As outlined in its\ncommittee charter, the Cybersecurity Risk Management Committee of the Board (“Cybersecurity Risk Committee”)\nassists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility. Our CISO, Michael Adams, leads the team responsible\nfor implementing and maintaining our information security program and reports directly to the Chief Operating\nOfficer (“COO”), who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Mr. Adams is a graduate of the United\nStates Naval Academy and brings nearly 30 years of security and leadership experience, including serving as Deputy\nGeneral Counsel of NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command, Deputy General Counsel of the\nUnited States' Military's Pacific Command, and Deputy General Counsel for two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\nof the United States, as well as an executive at a leading technology company. Mr. Adams previously also served as\nZoom's Chief Counsel to the COO and CISO.\nThe CISO provides regular briefings to our senior management and the Cybersecurity Risk Committee concerning\nrelevant cybersecurity risks and the processes we have implemented to address them. The Cybersecurity Risk\nCommittee and the Board also receive various reports, summaries, and presentations related to cybersecurity\nthreats, risks, and mitigations."

                "content": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to provide one platform that delivers limitless human connection.\nZoom is an intelligent, secure collaboration platform that makes connecting easier, more immersive, and more\ndynamic for businesses and individuals. We’re committed to evolving our platform in ways that empower limitless\nhuman connection and solve real business problems. All of our product innovation has a unified goal: to help\nstreamline the workday through effective communication and collaboration tools. The Zoom platform makes teamwork\nmore meaningful, drives impact with intelligence, strengthens customer relationships, and enables seamless\nworkflows. Additionally, trust is a cornerstone of the\n50\nTable of Contents\nZoom platform. We equip users with a comprehensive set of tools to make their interactions safe, secure, and\nprivate. We believe that strong security should never compromise a great user experience.\nWe’re on a mission to reimagine the way we communicate and collaborate in a hybrid working world. The Zoom platform\nbrings employee and customer experience together that people love to use. Flagship products like Zoom Meetings,\nZoom Phone, and Zoom Team Chat are among the core products on the platform that are critical to business\ncommunication and collaboration needs. We strive to continue building a platform that helps people work smarter, be\nmore engaged with work, and better connect with each other. AI has been core to Zoom’s product DNA over many years,\ngrounded in our conviction that AI can make work more human by strengthening collaboration, productivity, and\ninclusivity.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued to invest in AI and focused on three key areas regarding AI innovation:\nsupporting individual productivity, powering better collaboration, and helping customer-facing teams delight their\ncustomers. We recently launched Zoom AI Companion, our smart assistant that is designed to empower workers to\nincrease productivity, improve team effectiveness, and enhance skills. Additionally, we introduced our federated\napproach to AI, which enables us to make Zoom’s AI capabilities accessible and affordable so that more people can\nincorporate them in their day-to-day workflows. In line with our commitment to responsible AI, Zoom does not use\ncustomer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or other communications (such as poll results,\nwhiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party AI models.\nWe believe that face-to-face communications build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution while prioritizing their privacy and security. Our 29\nco-located data centers worldwide and the public cloud in conjunction with our proprietary adaptive rate codec\nenable us to provide both high-quality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth\nenvironments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform.\nSubscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of customers as well as purchases of additional products,\nincluding Zoom Phone, Zoom Spaces, Zoom Events, Zoom Contact Center and Zoom Revenue Accelerator. We define a\ncustomer as a separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid user or an organization of any size\n(including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple users. Our Zoom One Basic offering is free and\ngives users access to Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that meetings time-out at 40\nminutes. Our core paid offerings are available with our Zoom One bundles: Zoom One Pro, Business, Business Plus,\nEnterprise, Enterprise Plus, and Enterprise Premier. The Zoom One bundles are designed for different business needs\nand are composed of Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Whiteboard and Mail and Calendar as well as Zoom Phone,\nZoom Webinars and Zoom Rooms for our Enterprise plans. We also offer vertical-specific plans for Education,\nHealthcare and Government which provide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant\nlimits, administrative controls, and reporting.\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in four specific markets (Australia/New Zealand, Japan,\nUnited Kingdom/Ireland and United States/Canada). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in more than 45 countries and territories\nwhere Zoom has local public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) coverage.\nOur revenue was $4,527.2 million, $4,393.0 million, and $4,099.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 3.1% and 7.1%, respectively. We had net\nincome of $637.5 million, $103.7 million, and $1,375.6 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,598.8 million, $1,290.3 million, and\n$1,605.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nMacroeconomic Conditions and other Factors\nRecent macroeconomic shifts, including high inflation, elevated interest rates, and the responses by central\nbanking authorities, potential recessionary environments, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have\nintroduced uncertainty to our business. Additionally, the possibility of a U.S. federal government shutdown,\nresulting from budgetary challenges, may negatively impact global economic conditions, influencing corporate and\nconsumer spending as well as capital market liquidity. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we continued to\nexperience growth in total revenue and revenue from Enterprise customers. However, macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding high inflation and continued uncertainty regarding the current and future political and economic\nenvironment, have and may continue to impact the future demand for subscriptions to our unified communications and\ncollaboration platform. For example, we have experienced and may continue to experience elongated sales cycles as\nwell as a decrease in customers’ overall corporate spending, which is negatively impacting our revenue growth rate\nand net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers. In addition, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we\nexperienced unfavorable foreign currency impact as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar\ncompared to certain foreign jurisdictions where we do a significant amount of business, which resulted in a $34.1\nmillion\n51\nTable of Contents\nnegative impact on revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Many factors may contribute to declines in\nour growth rate as compared to prior fiscal years, among other things, higher market penetration, increased\ncompetition, slowing demand for our platform, a slower than anticipated capitalization on growth opportunities, and\nthe maturation of our business.\nWe are continuously monitoring the impact of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as\nthe overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. The implications of macroeconomic conditions on our\nbusiness, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. On\nFebruary 7, 2023, as a result of the economic environment, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce\noperating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The restructuring plan included\na reduction of our then-current workforce by approximately 15%.\nIn addition, the global impacts stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the recent conflict in Israel and\nthe surrounding area continue to present a high level of uncertainty. Our customers in these regions collectively\nrepresented approximately 1% of our net assets and total consolidated revenue as of and for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2024. If the conflicts in these regions persist or worsen, possibly leading to additional sanctions,\ntightened export restrictions, and greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of\noperations could be materially impacted. Refer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for further discussions of the potential impacts of the current macroeconomic conditions on our business.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or\nthe future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and\nmarketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who\nare able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or geography, before\nrolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have deployed our platform\nglobally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of our platform\nalso provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers, such as Zoom Phone,\nSpaces, Contact Center, Revenue Accelerator, Events and Developer Platform Solutions. In order for us to address\nthis opportunity and expand the use of our products with our existing customers, we will need to maintain the\nreliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that are responsive to our customers’\nrequirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing Enterprise customers through our net dollar expansion rate. We define\nEnterprise customers as distinct business units who have been engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers,\nor strategic partners. Revenue from Enterprise customers represented 57.9%, 54.8% and 47.6% of total revenue for\nthe fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the\nincrease in user adoption within our Enterprise customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven by the\nnumber of paid licenses within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our subscription\nrevenue from the same set of Enterprise customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion rate\nas of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all Enterprise customers as of 12\nmonths prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from\nall customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying\nit by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all Enterprise customers\nfor the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication\nthat they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these Enterprise customers as of the\ncurrent period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and attrition. We divide the\nCurrent Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For the trailing 12-months\ncalculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12 months. Our net dollar\nexpansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our\ncustomer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Enterprise customers. Our trailing\n12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 101%, 115%, and 130% as of January 31, 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n52\nTable of Contents\nRetention of Online Customers\nIn addition to Enterprise customers, we also have a significant number of customers that subscribe to our services\ndirectly through our website (“Online customers”). Online customers represent a diverse customer base, ranging from\nindividual consumers to small and medium size businesses. We continue to focus on acquisition and retention of our\nOnline customer base through various strategies to improve the features and functionalities of our products and\nservices. Revenue from Online customers represented 42.1%, 45.2%, and 52.4% of total revenue for the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The ability to retain these Online customers will have an\nimpact on our future revenue. The online monthly average churn for our Online customers was 3.1%, 3.4%, and 3.9%\nper month for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. One of the dynamics in the\nOnline portion of the business is the MRR contribution from customers that have retained Zoom services for a\ncertain portion of time as these customers tend to maintain their subscriptions and contribute meaningfully to the\nOnline business. As of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the percentage of total Online MRR from Online customers\nwith a continual term of service of at least 16 months was 74.2%, 72.0% and 58.8% respectively.\nWe calculate our online average monthly churn by starting with the Online customer MRR as of the beginning of the\napplicable quarter (“Entry MRR”). We define Entry MRR as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements\nfrom all Online customers except for subscriptions that we recorded as churn in a previous quarter based on the\ncustomers' earlier indication to us of their intention to cancel that subscription. We then determine the MRR\nrelated to customers who canceled or downgraded their subscription or notified us of that intention during the\napplicable quarter (“Applicable Quarter MRR Churn”) and divide the Applicable Quarter MRR Churn by the applicable\nquarter Entry MRR to arrive at the MRR churn rate for Online customers for the applicable quarter. We then divided\nthat amount by three to calculate the online average monthly churn.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of new products and enhancements including Zoom AI Companion, new features for Zoom Contact\nCenter, Zoom Notes, integration of Workvivo into the Zoom desktop client, and ongoing enhancements for Zoom Phone,\nMeetings, Zoom Rooms, Huddles, Webinars and Zoom Events. We also deliver Zoom Phone calling plans in more than 45\ncountries and territories as of January 31, 2024.\nWe also recently announced several upcoming products including Zoom Docs and an enhanced version of AI Companion\nthat is designed to allow the handling of complex tasks across our platform using information from multiple sources\nincluding third party applications. These products are expected to be generally available in 2024.\nIn April 2023, we acquired Workvivo, an employee experience platform that combines internal communication and\nengagement tools, a social intranet, and an employee app. With the acquisition, we continue our evolution to\nprovide a collaboration platform that enables modern work and powers the digital-first workplace, offering our\ncustomers new ways to keep employees informed, engaged, and connected.\nThird-party developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for\ncustomers and developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more\ndevelopers and other third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the\nubiquitous platform for communications and collaboration. We will need to expend additional resources to continue\nintroducing new products, features, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the\nvalue of our platform with their own applications.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants as well as on Zoom Phone. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures\nZoom meetings by default, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host, or originating caller in the case of Zoom Phone,\nas opposed to Zoom's servers, generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to distribute these keys\nto the other meeting participants or call recipient.\nInternational Opportunity\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 28.7%, 30.5%, and\n33.3% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decrease\nin revenue from the rest of the world in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was due to the impact of\nthe strengthening of the U.S dollar along with macroeconomic conditions in the EMEA region. We plan to add local\nsales support in further select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in\ncertain international markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for\nour platform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\n53\nTable of Contents\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of Enterprise customers is an indicator of our potential future\nbusiness opportunities, the growth of our business, and an indicator of our market penetration. Increasing\nawareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of our technology, has expanded\nthe diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, we\nexpect Enterprise customers to represent a larger share of our business. As of January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we\nhad approximately 220,400, 213,000, and 191,000 Enterprise customers, respectively.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 29.2%, 27.1%, and 21.9% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively. As of January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we had 3,810, 3,471, and 2,725 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid\npenetration of larger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metric, may calculate this metric differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP metric as\na comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2024            2023             2022\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,598,836    $  1,290,262    $   1,605,266\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -126,953        -103,826         -132,590\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,471,883    $  1,186,436    $   1,472,676\nNet cash used in investing activities       $              -1,183,689    $   -318,322    $  -2,859,097\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing    $                  60,186    $   -936,942    $      34,068\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications and\ncollaboration platform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also\nprovide services, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are\ngenerally considered distinct from the access to our unified communications and collaboration platform. The amount\nof revenue recognized reflects\n54\nTable of Contents\nthe consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract term which can include\na free period discount.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-\nlocated data centers, third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses,\namortization of capitalized software development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated\noverhead.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; certain indirect taxes; litigation settlements; corporate security and regulatory\nexpenses; and allocated overhead.\nGains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, Net\nGains (losses) on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable\nsecurities and effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision

The change in income taxes was primarily due to changes in\nincome before taxes, tax shortfalls on stock-based compensation, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction,\nand the valuation allowance recorded against certain federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets as of January\n31, 2024. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $7.0 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the recent\nmacroeconomic shifts, such as high inflation, changes in interest rates and the responses by central banking\nauthorities, potential recessionary environments, and the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which\ncould impact the timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in the section titled “Risk\nFactors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our existing cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet\nour needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We believe we will\nmeet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from\noperating activities and available cash balances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,\nincluding our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of\nspending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses\nassociated with our international expansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest\nin existing and new office spaces as well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into\narrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual\nproperty rights. We may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $          78,411    $                 26,922    $   35,405    $  15,467    $        617\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         615,761                     247,361       356,536       11,864               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         694,172    $                274,283    $  391,941    $  27,331    $        617\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and\n59\nTable of Contents\nmarketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted for certain\nnon-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as the\neffect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,598.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared\nto $1,290.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. The increase in operating cash flow was mainly\ndriven by higher net income of $533.8 million and the positive impact from changes in operating assets and\nliabilities of $158.2 million, offset by a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $383.5 million, which is primarily a\nresult of higher gains on strategic investments, net, and lower stock-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,183.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was due to net\npurchases of marketable securities of $951.4 million, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $204.9\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $127.0 million, purchases of strategic investments of $70.5\nmillion, partially offset by proceeds from strategic investments of $170.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $318.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $120.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of\n$103.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $69.1 million, net purchases of marketable securities of\n$13.9 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $11.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $60.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was due to\nproceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $54.1 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from employee equity\ntransactions remitted to employees and tax authorities, net, of $4.1 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $936.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to cash paid for repurchases of common stock of $1.0 billion, offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock\npursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $53.7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock\noptions of $8.6 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of our Class A\ncommon stock. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market\n(including pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other transactions in accordance with\napplicable securities laws.\nThe timing and the amount of any repurchased Class A common stock will be determined by our management based on its\nevaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using our working capital.\nAny repurchased shares of Class A common stock will be retired. The repurchase program does not obligate us to\nacquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued\nat any time at our discretion. As of March 1, 2024, there have been no repurchases made.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\n60\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and\nSignificant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following critical estimates involve\na greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We apply judgment during the identification of a contract to\ndetermine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the\ncustomer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information\npertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the\ntransaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue\nrecognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform\nand related significant features. Sales commission is generally not paid upon contract renewal. Amortization is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nStrategic Investments\n61\nTable of Contents\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment evaluates key factors including but not\nlimited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which\nthe investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair\nvalue by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying\nvalue for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent\nin enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2024 would not have had\na material impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a portion of our revenue from\namounts denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the\njurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in Australia, China, Europe and the United\nStates. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 19.3% ,\n20.0% and 22.6% of our revenue, respectively and 13.7%, 10.8% and 16.8% of our expenses, respectively were\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency\nexchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated\nfinancial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. As the impact of\n62\nTable of Contents\nforeign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into\nderivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more\nsignificant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion and marketable securities of $5.4 billion as of January 31, 2024.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds and high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n63\nTable of Contents"

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n65\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,527\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nSummary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nprovide a unified communications and collaboration platform that connects people through frictionless and secure\nmeetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 2011, and\nare headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2024, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2024.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation\nexpense, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of\ndeferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2024 or 2023. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $ 6.9million and $ 13.1million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\n73\nTable of Contents\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2024            31, 2023\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        568,449    $        590,610\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -25,916             -24,900\nLess: Allowance for returns                    -6,455              -8,306\nAccounts receivable, net             $        536,078    $        557,404\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, our assessment considered the recent changes in macroeconomic\nconditions such as inflation, recessionary and uncertain environments, and fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates has on our estimates of credit and collectibility trends. Below is a rollforward of our allowance\nfor credit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nJanuary 31, 2024       January 31, 2023\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            24,900    $            17,000\nProvision for credit losses                     47,267                 45,211\nWrite-offs                                     -46,251                -37,311\nBalance as of end of year          $            25,916    $            24,900\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through gains (losses) on strategic\ninvestments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n74\nTable of Contents\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments. Privately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured\nat cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in\ngains (losses) on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment.As of January 31, 2024, we recognized an immaterial amount of impairment to our\nprivately held debt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications and collaboration platform during the\napplication development stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be\nused to perform the function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and\nequipment, net. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\nincurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s\nestimated useful life, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.We have\ncapitalized $ 8.1million, $ 18.0million, and $ 20.2million of software development costs during the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\n75\nTable of Contents\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at\nthe commencement date based on the present value of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease\nliabilities as our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to\napproximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment\nwhere the leased asset is located. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments\nmade at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and\nwhen a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance\nleases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-\nlived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period\nof amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the\nuseful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine that the life of an\nintangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively\nover its estimated remaining useful life.There were no impairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting\n76\nTable of Contents\nservices, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue is\nrecognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract term which can include a\nfree period discount. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications and collaboration platform, which consists of one or more software-based services.\nOur customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we\nprovide a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications and collaboration platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a\nprofessional manner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include\nservice-level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and\npermitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits\nrepresent a form of variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements\nin the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and related services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the\nrelated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 1% of total revenue during the periods presented.\n77\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located\ndata center costs, third-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related\nexpenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments,\nand allocated overhead costs. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related\ndepreciation, health care benefits, training, and other employee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and\noperating expenses based on applicable headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and\ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expenseand amounted to $ 56.5million, $\n64.7million, and $ 40.9million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, RSUs, and ESPP) is measured\nbased on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of assumptions, including the fair value of the\nunderlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock,\nrisk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related\n78\nTable of Contents\nto uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are\nincluded with the related tax liability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options, to be participating securities as holders of such\nsecurities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common\nstock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our CEO, in\ndeciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker allocates\nresources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 124.8million and $ 91.6million as of January 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and the amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within other assets, noncurrent on\nthe consolidated balance sheets was immaterial as of January 31, 2024 and 2023.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 1,257.4million, $ 1,140.7million, and $\n858.2million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n3,574.8million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,270.4million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 2,304.4million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 58%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nGenerally we do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid\nfor the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer\nlife and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform and related significant\nfeatures. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded\nduring the periods presented.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition costs:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2024           2023\n-in thousands\nBeginning balance                       $                 403,241    $   363,980\nAdditions to deferred contract                            214,657        298,629\nacquisition costs\nAmortization of deferred contract                        -270,700       -259,368\nacquisition costs\nEnding balance                          $                 347,198    $   403,241\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,\ncurrent (to be amortized in next 12     $                 208,474    $   223,250\nmonths)\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,                      138,724        179,991\nnoncurrent\nTotal deferred contract acquisition     $                 347,198    $   403,241\ncosts\n3.

Unrealized losses for securities that\nhave been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer were $ 4.8million and $ 42.0million as of January\n31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We review the individual securities that have unrealized losses on a regular basis\nto evaluate whether or not any security has experienced, or is expected to experience, credit losses resulting in\nthe decline in fair value. We evaluate, among other factors, whether we have the intention to sell any of these\nmarketable securities and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any of them before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis. We have not recorded an allowance for credit losses, as we believe any such\nlosses would be immaterial based on the high-grade credit rating for each of our marketable securities as of the\nend of each fiscal year.

Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2024, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 247.4million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 368.4million.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 77.7million and $ 76.2million, respectively, of which $ 35.5million and $\n33.9million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 42.3million and $\n42.3million are included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based\non our best estimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of\na probable outcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue\nsubject to sales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant\nadjustments to the sales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements for changes to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in\nthe future as we obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nOther Contingencies\nIn June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took responding to\nlaw enforcement requests from the Chinese government. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of\nJustice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek\ndocuments and information relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our\nencryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public\nstatements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since\nreceived additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of\nthese investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are\nongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the\ninvestigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these\ninvestigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines,\npenalties, or other financial exposure, as well as reputational harm.\n89\nTable of Contents\nLegal Proceedings\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors, and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. On October 27, 2021, a\nthird substantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated. The\nconsolidated case was stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On April 11,\n2023, the court entered a stipulated order that requires defendants to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the\noperative complaint by June 12, 2023. On June 12, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated case.\nOn August 11, 2023, the plaintiff in the consolidated case filed an amended complaint. On October 18, 2023,\ndefendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 22, 2023, plaintiff filed her\nopposition to the motion to dismiss, and on January 26, 2024, defendants filed their reply in support of the motion\nto dismiss.\nWe are vigorously defending ourselves against these lawsuits. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary\nstage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and\nsuccess on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from these\nactions.\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in various U.S. federal district\ncourts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with\nthird parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state consumer\nprotection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims, such as negligence and\nunjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs seek various forms of injunctive and\nmonetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\nfederal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the NDCA with our consent; lead plaintiffs’ counsel have\nbeen appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint on October 28, 2020.\nOn March 11, 2021, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss, and gave plaintiffs leave\nto amend. On July 30, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs to settle the action on a\nclasswide basis, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the court on July\n31, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement,\nwe have paid $ 85.0million into an escrow account that will be used to pay claims filed by settlement class\nmembers, attorneys’ fees and expenses, administrative costs, and service payments to plaintiffs. On April 21, 2022,\nthe Court granted final approval of the settlement. On May 19, 2022, twoobjectors to the settlement appealed the\nCourt's final approval order. On May 20, 2022, a third objector appealed the Court’s final approval order. On\nOctober 17, 2022, we, plaintiffs, and all threeobjector-appellants agreed to settle the appeals, and on October 27,\n2022, we and plaintiffs initiated proceedings in the district court to obtain Court approval of the settlements,\nwhich the district court approved on December 16, 2022. On January 13, 2023, a new objector appealed the court’s\nDecember 16, 2022 approval of the settlements of the prior appeals, and on March 31, 2023, the Ninth Circuit\ndismissed the new appeal. With the appeals resolved, the class action settlement is final and the settlement\nadministrator is in the process of making payments to claimants.\nOn April 7, 2020 and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our officers\nin the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of ours. The complaints\nallege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 by making\nfalse and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about our data privacy and security measures. The\ncomplaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On\nNovember 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a\nconsolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on May 20, 2021. Plaintiff filed an\nopposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the motion to dismiss was filed on\nAugust 9, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss. On\nMarch 14, 2022, we moved for reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss. On March 22, 2022, the\ncourt ordered plaintiff to respond to our motion, which plaintiff did on March 29, 2022. On April 22, 2022, we\nanswered the complaint. On March 8, 2023, the court denied our motion for reconsideration. On April 6, 2023, the\ncourt entered a scheduling order. On July 17, 2023, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreement of\nsettlement (the “Stipulation”) to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the stipulation, in exchange for the\nrelease and dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the matter, we have agreed to pay\nand/or cause our insurance carriers to pay a total of $ 150.0million. The Stipulation and settlement remain subject\nto preliminary and final approval by the court. On July 25, 2023, the court entered an order staying further\nproceedings in the matter pending the filing of a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On October 17,\n2023, lead plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. A hearing on the motion for\npreliminary approval of the settlement is not currently scheduled. As a result of the settlement, we made net\n90\nTable of Contents\npayments of $ 60.0million ($ 150.0million for the settlement net of $ 90.0million covered by insurance) during the\nyear ended January 31, 2024, of which $ 7.5million had been accrued during the year ended January 31, 2023 and $\n52.5million was recorded as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for\nthe year ended January 31, 2024.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n10. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that are authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nCommon Stock\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2024          2023\nStock options outstanding                        3,314,228     4,800,616\nRSUs outstanding                                26,040,557    21,868,533\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                 2,086,604     2,851,856\nRemaining shares available for future           50,559,254    51,367,359\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future           14,712,385    11,930,797\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock            96,713,028    92,819,161\nreserved\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 1.0billion of our Class A\ncommon stock, which was completed in December 2022. During the year ended January 31, 2023, we purchased and\nsubsequently retired 11,170,907shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 1.0billion.\n91\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $ 1.5billion of our\nClass A common stock. See Note 14, \"Subsequent Events\" for additional information related to the authorized stock\nrepurchase program.\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time. In addition, the number\nof shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan automatically increases on February\n1 of each calendar year, starting on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the\ntotal number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of the fiscal year\nbefore the date of each automatic increase or (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors\nprior to the applicable February 1.\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nStock Options\nOutstanding                    Weighted-\nStock       Weighted-    Average\nOptions         Average    Remaining               Aggregate\n(in thousands, except share,        Exercise    Contractual             Intrinsic\nlife and per share data)           Price    Life (Years)                Value\nOutstanding as of January                        4,800,616    $       8.22                  4.9    $    322,929\n31, 2023\nExercised                                       -1,464,158    $       6.96                         $     90,039\nCanceled/forfeited/expired                         -22,230    $      92.95\nOutstanding and\nExercisable as of                                3,314,228    $       8.21                  3.9    $    189,921\nJanuary 31, 2024\nThere were nooptions granted for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The feature was subsequently modified in March and October 2022 to\nprovide potential additional supplemental awards. The features and resulting modifications resulted in incremental\nstock-based compensation expense that is being recognized from the respective modification dates through the\nremaining requisite service period for each of the original awards. In November 2022, we cancelled one of the\nfeatures related to a sub-population of the modified awards. As a result, the amount of the unrecognized\ncompensation cost as calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation approach related to the cancelled awards of $\n207.7million was recognized during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nAs of January 31, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested RSUs was $\n1,782.2million, including the impact of the modification, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 2.5years.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 ESPP, which became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 921,892,\n678,279, and 838,395shares, respectively, of our Class A common stock were purchased under the ESPP.\nAs of January 31, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $ 38.6million, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1years.\n93\nTable of Contents\nWe estimated the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2024                      2023            2022\nExpected term (years)      0.5-2.0                   0.5-2.0         0.5-2.1\nExpected volatility        30.0% -57.6%              57.6% -64.6%    40.3% -75.0%\nRisk-free interest rate    4.6% -5.4%                2.2% -4.8%      0.0% -2.5%\nExpected dividend yield    —                         —               —\nThe stock-based compensation expense by line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is\nsummarized as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,                2024            2023          2022\n-in thousands\nCost of revenue                                                  $        143,798    $    174,546    $   69,612\nResearch and development                                                  336,309         361,720       113,000\nSales and marketing                                                       381,298         532,371       229,297\nGeneral and administrative                                                195,756         217,115        65,378\nTotal stock-based compensation                                          1,057,161       1,285,752       477,287\nexpense\nBenefit from income taxes                                                -197,068        -199,971       -84,245\nTotal stock-based compensation\nexpense                                                          $        860,093    $  1,085,781    $  393,042\nrecorded to net income\n11. Restructuring Activities\nOn February 7, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs and continue\nadvancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan included a reduction of our then-current workforce\nby approximately 15%.\nThe execution of the Plan was completed as of July 31, 2023. For the year ended January 31, 2024, we recorded net\nrestructuring costs of $ 73.0million, which consisted of $ 54.4million related to employee transition, severance\npayments, and employee benefits; $ 17.3million related to stock-based compensation awards; and $ 1.3million for\nother related expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our restructuring expenses that were recorded as an operating expense in the\nconsolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2024:\nYear Ended January 31, 2024\n-in thousands\nCost of revenue                 $                        7,119\nResearch and development                                19,629\nSales and marketing                                     32,930\nGeneral and administrative                              13,315\nTotal restructuring expenses    $                       72,993\nThe following table summarizes our restructuring liability that is included in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheet:\n94\nTable of Contents\nSeverance and termination benefits\n(in thousands)        Other\nBalance as of January 31, 2023                                        —            —\nRestructuring expenses                                           54,361        1,339\nCash payments                                                   -54,361       -1,339\nBalance as of January 31, 2024    $                                   —    $       —\n12.

As of January 31, 2024,\nmanagement concluded that the valuation allowance related to the U.K. net deferred tax assets was no longer needed\nprimarily due to its assessment of income/loss in recent periods and the forecast of future taxable income. Based\non evaluation of all positive and\n96\nTable of Contents\nnegative evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized\nfor U.K. purposes. Accordingly, management has recognized a non-recurring tax benefit of $ 10.7million related to\nthe valuation allowance release. Based on the available objective evidence during the year ended January 31, 2024,\nwe believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits relating to U.S. losses that are capital in nature\nand certain state and other foreign deferred tax assets may not be realized prior to expiration. Accordingly, we\nhave maintained a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and intend to maintain the applicable\nvaluation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the\nvaluation allowance.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 12.3million for federal income\ntax purposes, $ 14.2million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if unused.\nWe also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 35.6million, which have an indefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 1.2million for\nfederal income tax purposes and $ 31.9million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development\ntax credits have a twenty-year carryover period while the state research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382\nand Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. Such provisions limit\nthe net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences,\nincluding significant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382 review and determined that materially none\nof our operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2024         2023         2022\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  30,404    $  19,171    $  14,884\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                   228          877            —\nGross decreases                                                     —            —       -3,764\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                12,415       10,547        8,211\nGross decreases                                                  -891            —            —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                  -384         -191         -160\nAcquisitions                                                        —            —            —\nBalance, end of year                        $                  41,772    $  30,404    $  19,171\nAs of January 31, 2024, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 41.8million ($\n46.5million total, including $ 4.7million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2023, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 30.4million ($ 32.5million total, including $\n1.6million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2022, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 19.2million ($ 19.6million total, including $ 0.4million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 4.7million, $ 1.6million, and $ 0.4million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2024, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\n97\nTable of Contents\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we started capitalizing research and development expenses incurred\nbeginning in fiscal year 2023. These expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic research\nand fifteen years for international research. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax\nliabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. The cash flow impact will decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenditures\ncontinue to amortize.\n13.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2024 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2024 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n99\nTable of Contents"

This AI-first approach to\nZoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services is designed to allow individuals and teams to free up time and focus on\nwhat matters most: engaging, connecting, and delivering creative and insightful work, all within one unified\nplatform\nEnterprise readiness: Zoom is built to meet the needs of enterprises, with robust reliability, security,\ncompliance, and privacy capabilities and policies.\nDesigned for flexible work: Zoom is a platform designed for flexible communication and today’s flexible work\nneeds.\nZoom just works: Ease of use is a core design principle, along with quality and reliability.\nCost-effective and value-focused: The total cost of ownership of the Zoom platform, across the employee\nexperience and customer experience, is less than that of our competitors.\nOpen platform that enables customer choice: The Zoom developer ecosystem enables customers to choose the apps and\nintegrations they prefer. Zoom offers more than 2,900 apps on the Zoom App Marketplace and integrations with key\nsoftware vendors, such as Microsoft and Google.\nWe’re on a mission to reimagine the way the world communicates and collaborates. Zoom brings employee and customer\nexperience together into a single, AI-first, open platform that people love to use. Flagship products like Zoom\nMeetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Team Chat, and Zoom Docs are among the core products on the platform that are critical\nto business communication and collaboration needs. We strive to continue building a platform that helps people work\nsmarter, be more engaged with work, and better connect with each other. AI has been core to Zoom’s product DNA over\nmany years, grounded in our conviction that AI can make work more human by strengthening collaboration,\nproductivity, and inclusivity.\nIn fiscal year 2025, Zoom continued to invest in AI and focused on three key areas regarding AI: supporting\nindividual productivity, powering better collaboration, and helping customer-facing teams deliver meaningful\nbusiness value to delight their customers. In September 2023, we launched Zoom AI Companion, our smart assistant\nthat is designed to empower workers to increase productivity, improve team effectiveness, and enhance skills.\nAdditionally, we introduced our federated approach to AI, which enables the use of multiple large language models\n(“LLMs”), including Zoom’s own, to complete each task for users. Zoom’s federated approach allows its tech stack to\ndynamically select from multiple AI models, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, making AI accessible\nand affordable so that more people can incorporate them in their day-to-day workflows. With these advancements in\nAI Companion and our broader AI strategy, we believe we’re well-positioned as AI technology continues to evolve. We\nare evolving agentic AI capabilities within AI Companion that will continue to deliver practical value to customers\nwhile building on our ambitious vision of AI that truly amplifies human potential for our customers. In line with\nour commitment to responsible AI, Zoom does not use customer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or\nother communications (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party AI models.\n6\nTable of Contents\nZoom continues to be at the center of flexible work. Our continued product innovation is laser-focused on\nsupporting a flexible work environment, with new innovations in areas such as document collaboration, hybrid\nworkspaces, and employee communication. Additionally, our employee experience platform, Workvivo, deepened our\ncommitment to creating a platform that is focused on connecting and engaging employees.\nUnlike most Contact Center as a Service (“CCaaS”) solutions that are only optimized for voice, Zoom Contact Center\nis an omnichannel cloud contact center platform that is optimized for video and intentionally supports a robust\nsuite of channels, such as voice and video, SMS, and webchat. The result is a one-stop shop designed for customer\nexperience leaders to deliver excellence to their customers and to strengthen workforce engagement.\nThe happiness we deliver is recognized by our customers. Zoom has consistently earned high scores across customer\nreview sites, Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2, including being recognized as a 2024 Customers’ Choice in\nthe Gartner Peer Insight “Voice of the Customer” for Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) and Visual\nCollaboration Applications, and a Leader badge for Zoom Contact Center by G2.

We deliver happiness to our customers by giving them experiences that add\nmeaningful business value and delight them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user\nexperiences. We believe these practices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to\ngenerate referrals from our existing customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nusers to our platform, we promote usage that allows them and their meeting attendees to experience the Zoom\ndifference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates\nthe viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales representatives, online\nchannel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach is designed to allow us to cost-effectively drive\nupgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication,\ncollaboration, and AI technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion\nof our engineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base. Our core areas of focus are bolstering innovation on products in the following categories: employee\nexperience, customer experience, core communications, generative AI and departmental and industry-specific\nsolutions.\nDrive international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world, we\nare poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems. Zoom continues to make meetings more effective\nand inclusive with new language captions and translations. Within a Zoom Meeting, translated captions will\ntranslate the source language into English captions or translate from English to the language selected by the\nmeeting participant. Translated captions support more than 35 languages. This facilitates seamless collaboration\nand helps to improve attendee engagement, including after the meeting, through AI Companion summaries.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments. Customers are also purchasing services for events, webinars, room solutions, phone, contact center,\nand employee experience, creating a complete and integrated set of communications services.\n7\nTable of Contents\nGrow our developer ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Through the Zoom Developer ecosystem, we enable\ncustomers and their developers to build their own solutions with our underlying platform technology, seamlessly\nembed our platform into their own offerings, and integrate their applications across Zoom products using our\nextensive library of application program interfaces (“APIs”) and selection of software development kits (“SDKs”).\nOur app marketplace further extends the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development and\ndistribution of apps and integrations. We continue to partner with video conferencing hardware and peripheral\nproviders, as well as with software providers, including Palo Alto Networks, Zendesk, and Box.\nOur Platform\nWe provide an open, AI-first work platform for human connection that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes\nhow people interact, connecting them through frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and\nmore. Our products are grouped under the following categories, which are further described below:\nAI - Zoom AI Companion drives impact with intelligence\nZoom Workplace - Enables seamless collaboration and productivity on a unified platform\nZoom Business Services - Strengthens customer relationships and delivers superior service\nEmployee Experience - Makes teamwork more meaningful and engaging\nDeveloper Ecosystem - Creates custom integrations and streamlines workflows\nAI\nZoom AI Companion\nZoom AI Companion, launched in September 2023, is Zoom’s generative AI digital assistant, designed to be seamlessly\nembedded across Zoom's suite of products to deliver real-time digital assistance and enhance productivity. It works\neffortlessly across Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Email, Zoom Whiteboard, and Zoom Events and more. Zoom AI\nCompanion uses a federated AI approach that incorporates Zoom’s own LLMs with third-party models to deliver high-\nquality results and lower customer costs. Zoom AI Companion is included at no additional cost for customers with\npaid services in their Zoom user accounts.\nZoom Workplace\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provides HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems.

Zoom Meetings feature a 49-person video\ngallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms, screen\nsharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more done\ntogether. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Box, Dropbox, Google,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees\nwho rely on their mobile devices or tablets throughout their business day.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 1000 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same 256-bit AES GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants. Additionally, a customer-managed key (“CMK”) service\nallows organizations to provide and manage their own encryption keys for certain customer content stored at rest in\nthe Zoom Cloud. The organization needs to manage the keys in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service. This\nallows for encryption of applicable content stored in the Zoom Cloud using the keys that the organization controls.\nWe believe Zoom was also the first UCaaS company to offer post-quantum E2EE solution video conferencing. Post-\nquantum E2EE works across Zoom Workplace, and employs upgraded algorithms designed to be able to withstand the\npotential future threats of quantum computers.\nTranslated captions help to remove language barriers, connect people, and promote inclusivity in meetings and\nwebinars. Zoom Meetings currently offers translated captions in 35 languages.\nZoom Phone\n8\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone is a cloud phone system for businesses that provides private branch exchange (“PBX”) features, such as\nsecure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail, switch\nto video, and much more.

Any decline in new customers,\nrenewals, or upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers, and maintain and expand our relationships with our\nexisting customers, including upselling additional products and new product categories to our existing customers\nand upgrading users from a free plan to one of our paid offerings.\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. Customers may also terminate or reduce the size of their\nexisting subscriptions. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers will renew their subscriptions\nutilizing the same tier of plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier, or purchase additional products, if they renew at\nall. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such as\ndissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer no longer having a need for our products, or a belief\nthat a competitor’s product is better, more secure, or less expensive than our products and platform. For example,\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions. As a result, our customer\nbase shifted largely from businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. Following\nthe pandemic, some of our customers reduced or discontinued their use of our platform, and additional customers may\ndo so in the future. Additionally, this shift in mix has resulted and may continue to result in higher non-renewal\nrates than we have experienced in the past. Renewals are also impacted by reductions in customer information\ntechnology spending budgets or a decision by the customer to consolidate their spending budgets on one of our\ncompetitor’s platforms, both of which are more likely to occur during periods of high inflation or recessionary or\nuncertain economic environments. We must continually add new customers and licenses to grow our business and to\nreplace customers and licenses who choose not to continue to use our platform. Finally, any decrease in user\nsatisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage users of our free offering to upgrade to one\nof our paid offerings by recommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications.\nHowever, free users may never upgrade to one of our paid offerings. We also seek to expand within organizations by\nadding new licenses, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of our platform into\nother teams and departments within an organization. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade free users to one\nof our paid offerings or expand the number of licenses within organizations, our business would be harmed.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and may continue to decline in future periods.\nOur revenue growth has fluctuated in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior\nquarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. There are no assurances we will be able to\nsustain our revenue growth in future periods, and our revenue growth rate may continue to remain flat or decline in\nfuture periods. Many factors have and may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher market\npenetration, increased competition, macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, recessionary or uncertain economic\nenvironments, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, slowing demand for our platform, a lower than\nanticipated capitalization on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business, among others. Our growth\nrate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common\nstock could be adversely affected.\n14\nTable of Contents\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers or cloud hosting services and a\nvariety of other factors, would impair the delivery of our services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties,\nand harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\ncloud hosting services such as Amazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of\nour business and Microsoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed\nmeeting architecture, we establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between\nvarious data centers. Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past resulted in and could in the\nfuture result in interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, other interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety of other factors, including, but not\nlimited to, infrastructure changes, vendor (including cloud hosting) issues, human or software errors, viruses,\nsecurity attacks, ransomware or cyber extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage,\nlocal administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements, and denial of service issues. In some\ninstances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these problems within an acceptable period of\ntime. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that impacted a subset of our users for a\nlimited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or\nconsolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or transfer our data and our\nusers’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite precautions that we take during\nthis process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and\nwe may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer. Interruptions, delays, or outages in\nour services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay penalties; may subject us to claims\nand litigation; and may cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to\nattract new customers. Our ability to attract and retain customers and licenses depends on our ability to provide\ncustomers and users with a highly reliable platform and even minor interruptions or delays in our services could\nharm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers or cloud hosting services are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for\ncapacity, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek to obtain additional capacity,\nwhich could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications and collaboration platform because\nof its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new co-located data centers\nthroughout the world to meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a\ntimely manner, including as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities and cloud hosting services we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error;\nintentional bad acts; earthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware\nfailures; systems failures; telecommunications failures; disease; and other public health related measures, any of\nwhich could disrupt our service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers or\ndisruption of the cloud hosting services we use, it may take a significant period of time to achieve full\nresumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Despite\nprecautions taken at these data center facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or\nother act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated\nproblems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing and\nincludes companies ranging from new market entrants to hyperscalers that provide technologies to improve\ncommunication and collaboration technologies platforms either as bundled solutions or standalone products. Given\nthe range of companies in this space, maintaining an open and robust marketplace with fair competition is\nimportant. Certain features of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies\nmarket with products offered by:\nbundled productivity suite providers with communication offerings, including Microsoft 365 (with Teams) and\nGoogle Workspace (with Meet);\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services into our platform, and with the introduction of new technologies and market\nentrants, including AI, we expect competition to continue to intensify.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2022, we launched Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for\nvideo, which competes against companies that offer similar services, such as Five9, Genesys, and NICE inContact,\nand new competitors that may enter that market in the future. As we continue to build out our platform, we may face\nincreased competition against companies that offer similar services and new competitors that may enter that market\nin the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from smaller\ncustomers, many of whom are consumers or small and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller\ncustomers, we face competition from more consumer-oriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the\nconsumer market than we do. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive\nadvantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and\nservices; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing, customers and partner relationships; more third-\nparty integrations; greater accessibility across devices and applications; greater access to larger user bases;\nmajor distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical, and\nother resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or strategic investments or enter into strategic\nrelationships to offer a broader range of products and services than we do, which may prevent us from using such\nthird parties' technology or offering such products or services. These combinations may make it more difficult for\nus to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain\ntheir market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their needs. In some cases, we have been forced to engage in price-cutting\ninitiatives or other discounts to attract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, and may have\nto do so in the future. We, on occasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription\nterm that can result in deferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on\nuncollected accounts receivable.\nOur results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should\nnot be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business. For example, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our\nunified communications and collaboration platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of\nwhich was attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased demand, we\nhave incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and\nexpanding our capacity. Fluctuations in our results may negatively impact the value of our securities. Factors that\nmay cause fluctuations in our results of operations include, without limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced plans;\nour ability to attract new customers and upgrade free users to one of our paid offerings;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles and linearity of our bookings, especially with respect to sales to large\nenterprises and highly regulated industries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign\ngovernmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases, and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\n16\nTable of Contents\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service, network outages, or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits, regulatory actions or investigations, legislator scrutiny, or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer or\nbusiness spending.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, such as high inflation and the responses by\ncentral banking authorities to control such inflation, recessionary or uncertain environments, fluctuations in the\nforeign currency exchange rates and geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, including the ongoing conflicts\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and tariffs and trade tensions, including the United States'\nongoing trade disputes with China and other countries. While some customers may view a subscription to our platform\nas a cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform\nas a discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their information technology spending on our platform\nduring an economic downturn or during times of economic uncertainty. Given current economic conditions, including\ninflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience a loss of users and customers, as well as a reduction\nin demand for our platform, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact\non various industries that our unified communications and collaboration platform addresses. In addition to the\nforegoing, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other third\nparties, such as bank failures, or concerns or speculation about any similar events or risks, could lead to market-\nwide liquidity problems, which in turn may cause third parties, including customers, to become unable to meet their\nobligations under various types of financial arrangements as well as general disruptions or instability in the\nfinancial markets. Moreover, we have lost and may continue to lose customers as a result of such customers ceasing\nto do business, and we have experienced and may continue to experience a material increase in longer payment cycles\nand greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. These issues may continue in the\nfuture if current economic conditions continue or worsen.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles have and could continue to lengthen, and we could\nexperience greater deployment challenges.\nWe invest significant resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a\nsignificant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval\nrequirements, all of which have and may continue to lengthen our sales cycle. We have also faced and may in the\nfuture face unexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of some or all\naspects of our platform. Large organizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing\nconcessions, or require additional security management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort,\nand money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or\nthat these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial\nup-front investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front\nsales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is\n17\nTable of Contents\ncritical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies market fails to\ngrow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\na reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending budgets on our\ncompetitors' platforms, especially during periods of inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic environments;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and there are no assurances we will be able to maintain or increase\nprofitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend\nsignificant funds on our sales and marketing efforts to attract new customers, expand the number of licenses and\nservices used by our customers and develop and enhance our products. We also intend to continue investing in\ngeneral corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of\nother businesses, upgrading our infrastructure, addressing security and privacy issues, and expanding into new\ngeographies and markets. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur\nincreased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated with acquiring customers are generally\nincurred up front, while the subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which\ncan be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear basis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect,\nand we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in\ndecreased profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a\nresult of the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other\nunknown events. While free users continue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing\nprograms focused on converting free users to paid subscriptions. Some of these users have upgraded to a paid plan\nbut the remainder have not and may never do so. If we are unable to increase or sustain our profitability, the\nvalue of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict\nthe size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our platform, customer adoption and renewal of our\nplatform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive products and\nservices. As a result, we may not be able to increase or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to\ngrow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of\n18\nTable of Contents\nour platform across these and other third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control, and some\nof these third parties can make it more difficult for our platform to interoperate with their systems in favor of\ncompetitive platforms. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other productivity software,\nit is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors own, develop, operate,\nor distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other software, and also have\nmaterial business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems,\napplications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform requires in order to\noperate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and services that more\ntightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business partners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Workplace product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our customer base and increase our revenue will\ndepend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and products; and\ninteroperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our customers\nmay require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. In particular, advancements in\ntechnology such as AI and machine learning are changing the way people work, and businesses that are slow to adopt\nthese new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. We invest significantly in research and development,\nand our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality and ease of adoption, enhance privacy and\nsecurity, and create organic demand for our platform. There is no assurance that new additions or other future\nenhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our\ncustomers or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If our research and development\ninvestments do not accurately anticipate demand or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies\ncustomer preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing\ncustomers or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings, such as AI-powered communication and collaboration tools, could make our platform\nobsolete or adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may experience\ndifficulties with software development, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development,\nintroduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features, or capabilities. We have in the past\nexperienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities and there can be no\nassurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any\ndelays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by users brought against\nus, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to our platform may require\nsubstantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful. If customers and users\ndo not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not perform as expected, we\nmay not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop, license, or acquire new\nfeatures and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such enhancements do not\nachieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe use generative AI including in our products and services, which may result in operational challenges, legal\nliability, reputational concerns, competitive risks and regulatory concerns that could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nWe use generative AI processes and algorithms, including by deploying generative AI features in our products and\nservices, which may result in adverse effects to our operations, legal liability, reputation and competitive risks.\nThe use of generative and agentic AI at scale is relatively new, and may lead to challenges, concerns and risks\nthat are significant or that we may not be able to predict. For example, AI algorithms use machine learning (“ML”)\nand predictive analytics which may be insufficient, biased, inaccurate or of poor quality, which could result in\ncustomer rejection or skepticism of our products, adversely impact the rights of individuals, affect our reputation\nor brand, and negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, we rely on third parties for certain AI\nfeatures of our products and if such third parties do not provide us those features (or do not do so on acceptable\nterms), experience interruptions, or cease operating, we may need to work with another provider, which may take\ntime or may not be possible, and could result in the disruption of certain of our products or services, affect our\nreputation or brand, and negatively affect our financial results. We could also face claims from third parties\nclaiming infringement of their intellectual property or other proprietary rights with respect to materials used or\ncreated by generative or agentic AI tools or features that we believed to be available for use and not subject to\nsuch rights. The investment required to bring AI features to market and the costs associated with providing these\nfeatures to our customers may be significant, and we may be unable to recover these costs if customers and users do\nnot widely adopt these features. We currently offer our AI features at no additional cost, as we believe they will\nultimately enhance user satisfaction, improve customer retention, and drive revenue. If such benefits are not\nrealized, the associated investment costs could further negatively impact our margins. Further, use of generative\nAI tools by our employees or others could result in disclosure of confidential or sensitive company and customer\ndata, reputational harm, and legal liability.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and services will\ndepend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue\nexpanding our sales and marketing capabilities, including through strategic partners, both domestically and\ninternationally. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing operations, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, as the cost to acquire\ncustomers through these efforts is high. Our business will be harmed if our efforts do not generate a\ncorrespondingly significant increase in revenue.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel\ntheir subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaboration technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users has grown and their\nusage of communications capacity has increased, we have been required to make additional investments in network\ncapacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of\nwhich may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity does not continue to be available to us to support\nour user base in the future, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission\ncapacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third parties providing\ninternet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not have access to our\nplatform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new\ntechnologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased\ndemand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential\nusers to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid\nour platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party\n20\nTable of Contents\nservices, including our platform, by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or\nfacilitate third-party services or by charging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party\nservices, any of which would make our platform less attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, a regulatory regime generally referred to as network neutrality, subject\nto certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The order requires broadband providers to publicly\ndisclose accurate information regarding network management practices, performance characteristics, and commercial\nterms of their broadband internet access services sufficient to enable consumers to make informed choices regarding\nthe purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and\nmaintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial\nchallenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to the new rules, but reversed the FCC’s\ndecision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet service, requiring case-by-case\ndeterminations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC’s rules. The court also required the\nFCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to remain in effect, while the FCC conducts that\nreview. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that the three issues remanded by the court did\nnot provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order. On October 19, 2023, the FCC adopted a notice of\nproposed rulemaking proposing to reinstate the 2015 rules, and on April 24, 2024, adopted an order that\nsubstantially reinstated those rules. On January 2, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a\ndecision overturning the FCC order. That decision remains subject to potential further appeals. We cannot predict\nthe impact of the new rules on our operations or business.\nIn addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that\nwould regulate the conduct of broadband providers, including legislation to impose state-level network requirements\nin New York. After a federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-\nspecific network neutrality law, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. A number of other states\nhave adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of\nbroadband providers. A similar law in Vermont is subject to a pending challenge, but went into effect on April 20,\n2022 and the challenge has been suspended until an appeal in another case addressing state powers to adopt internet\nregulation is resolved. The FCC’s April 24 order, which, as described above, was overturned by the Sixth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, permits it to preempt any state-level network neutrality requirements that go beyond the\nrequirements adopted in that order, but specifically held that the California law would not be preempted. We cannot\npredict whether the FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by\nlegal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s 2018 rules, which currently remain in\neffect, broadband internet access providers may be able to charge web-based services such as ours for priority\naccess or favor services offered by our competitors or by the internet access providers themselves, which could\nresult in increased costs and a loss of existing customers, impair our ability to attract new customers, and harm\nour business but the 2024 rules, if they go into effect, are intended to limit the ability of broadband internet\naccess providers to engage in such behavior.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\noverturned, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur security measures, and those of third parties with whom we work, have been compromised in the past and may be\ncompromised in the future. If our security measures are compromised in the future or if our information technology\nfails, this could harm our reputation, expose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our\nbusiness. In addition, if our products and services are perceived as not being secure, this could result in\ncustomers and users curtailing or ceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our\nbusiness being harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties with whom we work collect, receive, store,\nprocess, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share\nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data, including data of ours, our customers, and our users, the data which\nincludes personal information, customer and user content, health-related data, intellectual property, trade\nsecrets, business plans, and financial information. We and the third parties upon which we rely face a variety of\nevolving threats, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, which could cause security incidents. We\nroutinely investigate security incidents, which have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, that result\nin unauthorized access to, loss or unauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of confidential,\nproprietary, and sensitive information.\nCyberattacks, other malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities\nthreaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data and\ninformation technology systems, and those of the third parties with whom we work. Cloud-based platform providers of\nproducts and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. Threats are prevalent and continue to\nrise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and\n21\nTable of Contents\ncome from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized\ncriminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-state and nation-state\nsupported actors, and advanced persistent threat intrusions. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to\nengage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in\nconjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and\nthe third parties with whom we work may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, which could materially\ndisrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to provide our services. We and the third parties\nwith whom we work are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering\nattacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing\nattacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat\nintrusions), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing, personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks,\nsoftware bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology\nassets, adware, telecommunications failures, attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI, earthquakes, fires, floods, and\nother similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-\nstates, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to\nsignificant interruptions in our operations or our ability to provide our products or services, loss of data and\nincome, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a\nransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or\nregulations prohibiting such payments. Additionally, our platform, products, and services are relied on by a large\nnumber of companies worldwide and as a result, if our platform, products, or solutions are compromised, a\nsignificant number or all of our customers and their data could be simultaneously affected. The potential liability\nand associated consequences we could suffer as a result of such a large-scale event could be catastrophic and\nresult in irreparable harm.\nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional\ncybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in\nacquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we have discovered, and may in the future\ndiscover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it\nmay be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program.\nIn addition, our reliance on third parties has in the past and could continue to introduce new cybersecurity risks\nand vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to our business operations. We rely on third\nparties to operate critical business systems to process confidential, proprietary, and sensitive data in a variety\nof contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and\nauthentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, and other functions. We also rely on\nthird parties to provide other products, services and parts, or otherwise to operate our business. Our ability to\nmonitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have\nadequate information security measures in place. If the third parties with whom we work experience a security\nincident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if\nthe third parties with whom we work fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award\nmay be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain\nattacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in our\nsupply chain or that of the third parties with whom we work supply chains have not been compromised.\nIf our security measures are compromised, as has occurred in the past, our reputation could be damaged; our data,\ninformation or intellectual property, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised;\nour business may be harmed; and we could incur significant liability. We take steps designed to detect and\nremediate vulnerabilities in our information systems and those of third parties with whom we work, but we may not\ndetect or remediate all such vulnerabilities or do so in a timely manner. The threats and techniques used to\nexploit vulnerabilities change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature, and may be difficult to detect by\nsecurity tools. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident. We have limited budgetary and\nhuman resources for detecting and remediating vulnerabilities and have experienced difficulties in hiring and\nretaining qualified security personnel, especially after our recent restructuring actions. We may experience delays\nin developing and deploying remedial measures, including patches, designed to address identified vulnerabilities,\nand our remedial measures may require action by our customers such as installing patches or updates, which may\nincrease the amount of time a vulnerability remains unremediated. We have not always been able in the past and may\nbe unable in the future to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in\nour information systems or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems.\nIn addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to\nactively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may\nincrease because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications\nand collaboration platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced. For example,\nin July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the Zoom Meeting platform,\nincluding certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software addressing these\n22\nTable of Contents\nvulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by these\nvulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and their\nsoftware is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security researcher\nreported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized person to\ngain root access to a user’s system. Given the nature of our business and operations, our products and services\nwill inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects that have not been identified or remediated\nand cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We have identified high or critical vulnerabilities in our\nproducts, services and information systems in the past, and we expect that we will continue to identify such\nvulnerabilities in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to address any vulnerabilities in our\nproducts, services and information systems that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in\ndeveloping patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities.\nWe will continue to make prioritization decisions based on, among other things, our available resources, the\nefficacy of our security tools, and the increasing workload to meet certain security obligations, to determine\nwhich vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit\nthat compromises security. In some cases, customers are responsible for installing our software updates, and until\nthey do so, their service remains subject to the vulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities\nand critical security defects, errors in remediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party\nproviders to remediate vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or\ndeciding not to install software updates could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or\notherwise harm our business.\nSecurity incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security\nmay also prevent some of our customers and users from using or cause some of our customers and users to stop using\nour solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their subscriptions. Failures to meet customers’ and users’ expectations\nwith respect to security and confidentiality of their data and information could damage our reputation and affect\nour ability to retain customers and users, attract new customers and users, and grow our business.\nIn addition, cybersecurity events or security vulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with\ncustomers, lawsuits against us (including class action litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and\nsignificant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost\nrevenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in customer and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to\ncybersecurity incidents, increased costs to address cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents,\nfines, penalties, judgments and settlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because\nof any such incident.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that\ncould result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration,\nencryption, disclosure of, or access to confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data or our information technology\nsystems, or those of the third parties with whom we work A security incident or other interruption could disrupt\nour ability (and that of third parties with whom we work) to provide our services. We expend significant resources\nor modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain privacy, data\nprotection, and information security obligations require us to implement and maintain certain security measures or\nindustry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive data.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents, including\nthose recently promulgated by the SEC. These laws may also require us to take certain measures, such as providing\ncredit monitoring to individuals. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data\nbreach is costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse\nconsequences. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches.\nActual or perceived security gaps or security compromises experienced in our industry or by our competitors, our\ncustomers, a third party with whom we work, or us could cause us to experience adverse consequences, such as\ngovernment enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional\nreporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal\ninformation); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational\nharm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including\navailability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may\ncause customers to stop using our services, deter new customers from using our services, and negatively impact our\nability to grow and operate our business.\nIn addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States, like many similarly situated\ntechnology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel outside of the United States,\nincluding in China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as\nmarket and media scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy\nfeatures.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIncreased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand has led\nand could in the future lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our\ninformation security and potential vulnerabilities associated with our platform. For example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading to challenges for users who\ndid not have full IT support or established protocols for security and privacy like our larger customers. As a\nresult, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and security and privacy issues,\nincluding on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in material reputational harm, a loss\nof customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure, additional expenses, and other harm\nto our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use\nor other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or\ndamages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance\ncoverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny\ncoverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are not\ncovered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including\npremium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our business.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers and users\nand, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications and\ncollaboration platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users view the Zoom brand primarily\nas a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform that connects people through video,\nvoice, chat and content sharing, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market\nposition may be detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive,\nmaintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or\nperception of our platform, including from any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints\nstemming from increased usage, from our privacy or security features, because of sentiment towards the providers of\ncommunication and collaboration technologies generally, or from our integration of new product functionalities\nusing technologies with heightened public interest, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to\nattract and retain customers. Similarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or\nperceived violation by our employees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause\nus reputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our\nbusiness, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public\nperception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nharmed.\nWhile our employee headcount both in the United States and internationally has generally increased over time, we\nhave undertaken, and may undertake from time to time in the future, restructuring actions to better align our\nfinancial model. For example, in February 2023, we commenced certain restructuring actions, designed to reduce\noperating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth.\nThese organizational changes may not achieve or sustain the targeted benefits, or the benefits, even if achieved,\nmay not be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations. Steps we take to manage our\nbusiness operations, including workplace policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies\nfor future growth, may adversely affect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate\nhighly skilled personnel. Additionally, while we expect to continue to grow our business and operations over time,\nwe have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by\ngrowing companies in rapidly changing industries. Our ability to manage our growth and business operations\neffectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require\nus to continue to expend resources to support our global user-base and to retain, attract, train, motivate and\nmanage employees. This places a continuous, significant strain on our management, operational, and financial\nresources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are\nnot able to accurately forecast future growth, our business would be harmed.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing customers and make it more difficult to attract new customers;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, including the transition of our Chief Financial Officer in\n2024, may be disruptive to our business. Such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause\ndisruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively or execute our plans\nand strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover or otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly-qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all, which may be exacerbated by our recent restructuring actions and any\nsimilar future actions. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to\naddress a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely\nmanner. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience employee turnover as a result of our recent\nrestructuring actions. New hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity. New\nemployees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of\nqualified individuals. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel,\nour business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be\n25\nTable of Contents\nthreatened with legal action under agreements with their existing employers if we attempt to hire them, which could\nimpact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and resources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as\nrestrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to recruit internationally. We must also continue to retain and\nmotivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development\nopportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering (“IPO”), employees joining us at\ndifferent times could have significant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business. Further, the volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less\nattractive to current and potential employees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in\nhiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 28.2% and 28.7%, and\n30.5% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our customers\ninclude multinational corporations with global users, and we expect to continue to expand our international\noperations, which includes opening offices in new jurisdictions and providing our platform in additional languages\nto support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to\nallow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. If we are not able\nto satisfy certain government- and industry-specific requirements, we have in the past and may in the future\nexperience service outages or other adverse consequences, including interference with our local operations or\nrestrictions on our ability to continue our operations in certain jurisdictions, that would impair our ability to\noperate or expand further into certain markets. As an example, if local or national Chinese government agencies\ninterfered with or placed restrictions on our research and development operations in China, our ability to design\nnew products, features, and functionality on a timely basis or at all, or our ability to effectively deliver our\nservices, would be adversely impacted as a significant portion of our research and development organization resides\nin China. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally in the future\nrequires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting\na rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory\nsystems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international expansion will require\ninvestment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to recruiting and retaining\ntalented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex employment- and\ncompensation-related laws, regulations, and practices in these international jurisdictions, and maintaining our\ncompany culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to employees in\ncertain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations. This may\nrequire us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash\ncompensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees\nin these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and increases risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, automatic\nrenewals, and unsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees\nif our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices or develop new products, features, and functionality;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as the United States;\n26\nTable of Contents\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our intellectual property that resides outside of the United States, such as\nthe risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual property outside of the\nforeign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the continuing deterioration in diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and China, or deterioration in diplomatic relations between the United States and\ncountries with which the United States has traditionally enjoyed close ties and alliances, and the ongoing\nconflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary environments, recent\nbank failures and related uncertainties, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, weighing on our\ncustomers' ability to pay for our service on a timely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nAs described above, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, European\nUnion, and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus. Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian\nfinancial institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or\nthe SWIFT, payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be\ntaken in future, by the United States, NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could\nresult in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new\nbusiness opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. In addition, legal requirements in the United States and other\ncountries may come into conflict with each other making it challenging or impossible to comply with both countries’\nlegal requirements simultaneously. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal\npenalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and regulations\nor manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in\ncertain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, and any failure to comply with such laws\ncould harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-bribery and\nanti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees and\nintermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to\ngovernment officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public companies to make\nand keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of\nanti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as\n27\nTable of Contents\nwe continue to expand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGeopolitical tension between the United States and China, or between other economies, such as Taiwan, and China,\nmay intensify and lead to increased scrutiny of our business operations in China.\nWe have a significant number of employees, primarily engineers, in China, where personnel costs are less expensive\nthan in many other geographies. The number or proportion of our employees in China has fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including macroeconomic changes and internal restructuring.\nGeopolitical and national security tensions between the United States and China, or between other countries and\nChina, have in the past, currently are and could in the future lead to increased scrutiny of our business\noperations in China and a negative perception among current and potential customers regarding our collection, use,\nstorage, disclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies, any of which may harm our\nreputation and business. Additionally, we may face certain adverse consequences, as a result of geopolitical and\nnational security tensions between the United States and China, including interference with, or restrictions on,\nour local operations that would impair our ability to operate in China. As an example, if local or national Chinese\ngovernment agencies interfered with or placed restrictions on our research and development operations in China, our\nability to design new products, features, and functionality on a timely basis or at all, or our ability to\neffectively deliver our service, would be adversely impacted as a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment organization resides in China.\nIn June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took responding to law enforcement requests from the Chinese\ngovernment. The NDCA subpoena also requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between\nour employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any\nforeign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United\nStates. We are fully cooperating with these investigations and have conducted our own thorough internal\ninvestigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we\nwill ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We\ncannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could\ncause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm,\na loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and users could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers who increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced plan must be recognized\nover the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and users may harm our relationships with our customers\nand users and, consequently, our business.\nIncreased user demand for support may result in increased costs that may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, during the COVID-19 pandemic we saw surging demand requiring us to allocate additional resources to\nsupport our expanded customer and user base, including many who were using our platform for the first time, placing\nadditional pressure on our support organization. In addition, as we continue to support our global user base, we\nneed to be able to continue to provide efficient support that meets our customers and users’ needs globally at\nscale. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we need to hire additional\nsupport personnel, our business may be harmed. Our new customer signups are highly dependent on our business\nreputation and on recommendations from our existing customers and users. Any failure to\n28\nTable of Contents\nmaintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our\ncustomers and users, would harm our business.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our resellers or potential resellers to\nfavor their products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology, product offerings and processes requires\nsignificant time and resources. For resellers in certain emerging markets, we may be unable to effectively oversee\nand quality check certain processes, such as customer due diligence, which has and may continue to impact such\nresellers’ ability to implement robust customer verification protocols and mitigate fraud risk. If we decide to\nfurther develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and\nprocedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and training. Many resellers may not be\nwilling to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to effectively sell our platform. If we fail\nto maintain relationships with our resellers, develop relationships with new resellers in new markets, expand the\nnumber of resellers in existing markets, or manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing\nresellers, our ability to increase the number of new customers and increase sales to existing customers could be\nadversely impacted, which would harm our business.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nportion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the\ncurrencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025,\n2024, and 2023, 19.3%, 19.3%, and 20.0% of our revenue, respectively, and 16.4%, 13.7%, and 10.8% of our expenses,\nrespectively, were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies\nother than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure\nto fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and\nearnings and could materially impact our results of operations. For example, for the fiscal year ended January 31,\n2025, our total revenue was lower than anticipated in part due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We do not\ncurrently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to continue selling our products and services to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency\ncustomers, which may occur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers\nand/or through direct sales to government entities. While we are a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) authorized SaaS service, selling to government entities and other government contractors\npresents a number of unique challenges and risks including the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ncontracts with governmental entities are subject to termination for the convenience of the customer;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that are less favorable than what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould\n29\nTable of Contents\nexpect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability under the\ncivil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\nas a U.S. government contractor, we may be subject to executive orders and regulatory changes affecting various\naspects of our operations, including compliance with nondiscrimination plans, and any required elimination or\nmodification of such plans in response to new executive orders could pose challenges in hiring or retaining\nemployees and may lead to other adverse operational impacts, while failure to comply with these requirements could\nexpose us to administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, penalties, repayments or suspension\nor debarment from eligibility for future U.S. government contracts; and\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced, among other things, by public sector budgetary\ncycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector\ndemand for our products.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be\nrequired to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive\nOrder, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our\ncompliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the\nU.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.\nIn January 2025, the current administration began issuing Executive Orders identifying new government policy and\ndirecting U.S. federal agencies to evaluate their current actions, including certain spending, to ensure that such\nactions are consistent with new Administration priorities. Some of those Executive Orders are the subjects of\npending litigation, and there remains significant uncertainty about the ways in which agencies will implement the\nnew Executive Orders. Such implementation could negatively affect our current and future business with U.S.\ngovernment agencies.\nOur current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and users or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and users and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing platform or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, have attracted and may in the future\nattract negative attention if they involve technologies with heightened public interest, may fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and users or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New\nproducts may initially suffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market\nand sell such products to new and existing customers. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our\nproducts, or the introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products,\nincluding those incorporating AI features, fail to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers, or do not\nperform as expected, we may fail to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our\ninvestments in such products, any of which may harm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In\naddition, our current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the\nfuture, may require us to compensate or reimburse third parties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone,\nis a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate carriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of\nthe payments that we will receive from customers who will use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards\ncompensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our margins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products.\nIn addition, new products that we introduce in the future may similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties, all of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If this trend continues with our\nnew and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid user base to decline significantly.\n30\nTable of Contents\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses;\nchanges in tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use,\ndeferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples, changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other\nfundamental changes in tax law currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash\ntax liabilities but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. Although Congress has been considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to\nlater years, we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. Absent a change in\nlegislation, we expect the mandatory capitalization requirement will continue to have a material impact on our cash\nflows.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue derived from certain\ndigital services. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of\nthe OECD's Inclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by\nincreasing our future tax obligations.\nThe OECD has also been working on a Base Erosion and Profits Shifting project that, upon implementation, would\nchange various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\ncountries in which we operate. In this regard, the OECD has proposed policies aiming to modernize global tax\nsystems, including a country-by-country 15% minimum effective tax rate (“Pillar Two”) for multinational companies.\nNumerous countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation to implement the Pillar Two model\nrules with a subset of the rules becoming effective during our fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, and the\nremaining rules becoming effective for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2026, or in later periods. As these rules\ncontinue to evolve with new legislation and guidance, we will continue to monitor and account for the enactment of\nPillar Two rules in the countries where we operate, and the potential impacts such rules may have on our effective\ntax rate and cash flows in future years.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, due to, among other things, possible delays and\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approvals. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our\ncompetitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users,\ndevelopers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or\neffectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our\nacquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our company, the results of\noperations of the combined company could be adversely affected. The process of acquiring a business, including any\nintegration efforts, requires significant time and resources, requires significant attention from management, and\ncan disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully,\nwhich could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and\naccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for\nand model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our\nfuture performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could continue to slow or our revenue could\ndecline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;\ncontraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for\ncapacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities or to adapt and respond\nto inflationary factors affecting our business or future economic recession. The changes the COVID-19 pandemic\nfostered on the way companies operate, including the shifts to remote and hybrid work have limited our ability to\nforecast revenue, costs, and expenses due to the uncertainty around how companies choose to operate in the future,\nincluding the impacts of a remote and hybrid workplace. We have encountered and will encounter risks and\nuncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and\nuncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nlaws and regulations, industry standards, policies, and contractual obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, information security, and other matters could harm, and has in the past harmed, our reputation and\nbusiness and subject us to significant fines and liability.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make\naccessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information,\nincluding personal information, customer and user content, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property,\nthird-party data, business plans, transactions, and financial information. Our data processing activities subject\nus to numerous privacy, data protection, and information security obligations, such as various laws, regulations,\nguidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements.\nLaws in the United States\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal information privacy laws, consumer\nprotection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping\nlaws). Numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered\nbusinesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights\nconcerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete\ncertain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising,\nprofiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to\nprovide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal\ndata, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow\nfor statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) applies to\npersonal information of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide\nspecific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy\nrights. The CCPA provides for fines and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover\nsignificant statutory damages. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\nand local levels and we expect more states to pass similar laws in the future. These developments may further\ncomplicate compliance efforts and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom\nwe rely. Under various laws and other obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, we\nare required to obtain certain consents to process personal information. For example, some of our data processing\npractices may be challenged under wiretapping laws when we obtain consumer information from third parties through\nvarious methods, including chatbot and session replay providers, or via third-party marketing pixels. These\npractices are subject to increased challenges by class action plaintiffs. Several states and foreign jurisdictions\nhave enacted statutes imposing obligations on businesses collecting or processing biometric information. For\nexample, Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”) regulates the collection, use, safeguarding, and\nstorage of biometric information and provides for substantial penalties and statutory damages. The Federal Trade\nCommission (“FTC”), has indicated that use of biometric technologies (including facial recognition technologies)\nmay be subject to additional scrutiny. Our inability or failure to obtain consent for these practices could result\nin adverse consequences, including class action litigation, mass arbitration demands, and regulatory attention.\nLaws Outside of the United States\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards related to privacy,\ndata protection, and information security may govern. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (“EU GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (“UK GDPR”), Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de\nProteção de Dados Pessoais, or “LGPD”) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law\n(“PIPL”) impose strict requirements for processing personal information. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies\nmay face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million\nEuros under the EU GDPR and 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR, or 4% of annual global revenue, in each\ncase, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal information brought by classes\nof data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. China’s PIPL\nimposes a set of specific obligations on covered businesses in connection with their processing and transfer of\npersonal information and imposes fines of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of the prior year’s total annual revenue of\nthe violator. The Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”), also applies to the collection and processing of\npersonal information, including health-related information, by companies located in Switzerland, or in certain\ncircumstances, by companies located outside of Switzerland.\nWe also market to customers in Asia and have operations in Japan, Singapore and India, and may be subject to new\nand emerging privacy, data protection, and information security regimes in the region, including Japan’s Act on the\nProtection of\n33\nTable of Contents\nPersonal Information, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act, and India's new privacy legislation, the Digital\nPersonal Data Protection Act.\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal information from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United\nStates or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe\nand other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal\ninformation to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”)\nhave significantly restricted the transfer of personal information to the United States and other countries whose\nprivacy laws they generally believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions have in the past and may continue to adopt\nsimilarly stringent data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various\nmechanisms that may be used to transfer personal information from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance\nwith law, such as the EEA’s standard contractual clause, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK\nextension thereto (which allow for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and\nparticipate in the Framework), these mechanisms can be subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that\nwe can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal information to the United States.\nIf there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions\nto the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face\nsignificant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate\npart of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense,\nincreased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work\nwith partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal\ninformation necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal information out of\nthe EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from\nregulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to\nsuspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal information out of Europe for allegedly violating the EU\nGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations. For example, in May 2023, the Irish Data Protection Commission\ndetermined that a major social media company’s use of the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal\ninformation from Europe to the United States was insufficient and levied a 1.2 billion Euro fine against the\ncompany and prohibited the company from transferring personal information to the United States. The United States\nis also increasingly scrutinizing certain data transfers and may also impose certain data localization\nrequirements.\nWe may also become subject to new laws that regulate non-personal information. For example, the European Union’s\nData Act imposes certain data and cloud service interoperability and switching obligations to enable users to\nswitch between cloud service providers without undue delay or cost, as well as certain requirements concerning\ncross-border international transfers of, and governmental access to, non-personal information outside the EEA.\nDepending on how this Act and any similar laws are implemented and interpreted, we may have to adapt our business\npractices, contractual arrangements, and products and services to comply with such obligations.\nArtificial Intelligence\nOur development and use of AI technologies is subject to privacy, data protection, IP, and information security\nlaws, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements, as\nwell as increasing regulation and scrutiny. Several jurisdictions around the globe, including the EU, the UK and\ncertain U.S. states, have proposed, enacted, or are considering laws governing the development and use of\ntechnology featuring AI. For example, the EU's AI Act enters in phases this year and will have a direct effect\nacross all EU jurisdictions. The EU AI Act and other similar laws, if implemented and if applicable, could impose\nonerous obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. Obligations on AI may make it harder for us to\nconduct our business using, or build products incorporating, AI, require us to change our business practices,\nrequire us to retrain our algorithms, require us to disclose or provide greater transparency regarding the nature\nof our AI tools and the data we have employed to train them, or prevent or limit our use of AI. For example, the\nFTC has required other companies to turn over (or disgorge) valuable insights or trainings generated through the\nuse of AI where they allege the company has violated privacy and consumer protection laws. Additionally, certain\nprivacy laws extend rights to consumers (such as the right to delete certain personal information) and regulate\nautomated decision making, which may be incompatible with our use of AI. If we do not develop or incorporate AI in\na manner consistent with these factors, and consistent with customer expectations, it has in the past and may in\nthe future result in an adverse impact to our reputation, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a\ncompetitive disadvantage. Similarly, if customers and users do not widely adopt our new product AI experiences,\nfeatures, and capabilities, or they do not perform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our\ninvestment.\nLaws Relating to Minors\nAdditionally, regulators are increasingly scrutinizing companies that process minors' data and/or provide online\nservices or other interactive platforms used by minors. Numerous laws, regulations, and legally-binding codes, such\nas the Children’s\n34\nTable of Contents\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), California’s Age Appropriate Design Code, the CCPA, other U.S. state\ncomprehensive privacy laws, the EU and UK GDPR, the EU's Digital Services Act (\"DSA\"), the UK's Online Safety Act\n(\"OSA\") and the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, impose various obligations on companies that process minors' data\nand/or provide online services, or other interactive platforms used by children, including prohibiting showing\nminors advertising, requiring age verification, limiting the use of minors’ personal information, requiring certain\nconsents to process such data and extending certain rights to children and their parents with respect to that data.\nThese laws may, and in some cases already have been subject to legal challenges and changing interpretations which\nmay further complicate our efforts to comply with laws applicable to us. Some of these obligations have wide\nranging applications, including for services that do not intentionally target child users (defined in some\ncircumstances as a user under the age of 18 years old). In particular, COPPA is a U.S. Federal law that applies to\noperators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect\npersonal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they\nare collecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications and\ncollaboration services to schools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid\nclassrooms, distance learning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these\nservices, Zoom may be used by students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information\nfrom such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s\ninformation practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services. If we fail to accurately\nanticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of these laws, regulations, and legally-\nbinding codes, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions, litigation,\nfines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such failures, we could\nbe in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us, which could harm our\nreputation and business.\nConsumer Preferences and Protection\nIndividuals are increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver\ntargeted advertising. Third-party platforms have introduced (or plan to introduce) measures to provide users with\nmore privacy controls over targeted advertising activities, and regulators (including in the EEA/UK) are heavily\nscrutinizing the use of technologies used to deliver such advertisements. Major technology platforms on which we\nrely to gather information about consumers have adopted or proposed measures to provide consumers with additional\ncontrol over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information for targeted advertising or other\npurposes. For example, in 2021, Apple began allowing users to more easily opt-out of activity tracking across\ndevices. In February 2022, Google announced similar plans to adopt additional privacy controls on its Android\ndevices to allow users to limit sharing of their data with third parties and reduce cross-device tracking for\nadvertising purposes. Additionally, Google has announced that it intends to phase out third-party cookies in its\nChrome browser, which could make it more difficult for us to target advertisements. Other browsers, such as Firefox\nand Safari, have already adopted similar measures. In addition, legislative proposals and present laws and\nregulations regulate the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing.\nFor example, in the EEA and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to\nthe targeted advertising ecosystem. European regulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances\nwhere the regulators alleged that appropriate consent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising\nactivities. In the EU, it is anticipated that the ePrivacy Regulation and national implementing laws will replace\nthe current national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive, which may require us to make significant operational\nchanges. In the United States, the CCPA, for example, grants California residents the right to opt-out of a\ncompany’s sharing of personal information for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable\nconsideration, and requires covered businesses to honor user-enabled browser signals from the Global Privacy\nControl. Partially as a result of these developments, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the\ncollection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver targeted advertising or other types of tracking.\nIndividuals are now more aware of options related to consent, “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals\nfrom the Global Privacy Control), and “ad-blocking” software to prevent the collection of their personal\ninformation for targeted advertising purposes. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our\nproducts, and any of these developments or changes could materially impair our ability to reach new or existing\ncustomers or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers. For example, in September 2024, the FCC adopted new rules scheduled to take effect in 2027 that\nrequire video conferencing services to include features that expand accessibility requirements for consumers of our\nproducts and services. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nIndustry Standards\n35\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to privacy, data protection and information security laws, we are contractually subject to certain\nindustry standards adopted by industry groups and may become subject to additional such obligations in the future.\nWe also have certain privacy, data protection, information security obligations arising from the practices in our\nindustry or of companies similar to us. We are also bound by other contractual obligations related to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. If we\nfall below such industry standard or cannot comply with such contractual obligations, our reputation and business\nmay be harmed. We also publish privacy policies, marketing materials, whitepapers and other statements, such as\ncompliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding privacy, data protection,\nartificial intelligence and information security. Regulators in the United States have scrutinized and are\nincreasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be\ndeficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, misleading or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be\nsubject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences.\nGovernment Inquiries and Investigations\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nIn June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign political\nparties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user data, the\ndevelopment and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took responding to law enforcement\nrequests from the Chinese government. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various\nsecurity, data protection, and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as\nwell as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks\ninformation relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any\nattempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as\nthey relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking\nrelated information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have conducted our own thorough\ninternal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters\ncould cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational\nharm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business. As\nof the date hereof, in regard to the SEC matter, a tentative settlement of $18.0 million is now outstanding and\nremains subject to SEC approval. We do not know when these matters will be completed, including the SEC matter,\nwhich facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or\nmay not take.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nConsents\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our\n36\nTable of Contents\nservices and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability\nto store and process user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nPublic Perception\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand has led to greater public scrutiny\nof, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage, disclosure, and processing of\npersonal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and customers, particularly those\nthat are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their own IT controls like those of\na larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with control over user settings. This\nhas resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by malicious actors. Additional\nunfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation\nexposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, additional\nexpenses and other harm to our business.\nFailure to Comply with our Obligations\nObligations related to privacy, data protection, information security, the use of AI, the provision of online\nservices and other interactive platforms (and consumers' expectations regarding them) are quickly changing,\nbecoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to\ndiffering applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing\nfor and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources and has and may continue to\nnecessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third\nparties that process personal information on our behalf.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our obligations relating to\nprivacy, data protection, information security, the use of AI and the provision of online services and other\ninteractive platforms. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties with whom we work may fail to\ncomply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties\nwith whom we work fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable privacy, data\nprotection, and information security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited\nto: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar);\nlitigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting requirements and/or\noversight; bans or restrictions on processing personal information; and orders to destroy or not use personal\ninformation. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims\nagainst companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery\nof statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory\ndamages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of\ncustomers; inability to process personal information or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to\ndevelop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse\npublicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments have taken and may in the future take administrative, legislative, or regulatory\naction, including imposing tariffs, that could materially interfere with our ability to sell products in certain\ncountries. The direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure\nand are only one part of a larger U.S./China economic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are\nuncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or\nworsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the United States\nand its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to\nglobal trade, including retaliatory trade restrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot\npredict what actions may ultimately be taken by the current administration or future administrations with respect\nto tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products may be subject\nto such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Any further deterioration in\nthe relations between the United States and China could exacerbate these actions and other governmental\nintervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law in Hong Kong has created additional\nU.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with the business and operations of\nU.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy or operations made in order to\nadapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and certain of our competitors may\nbe better suited to withstand or react to these changes.\nFurther, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and communications technology\nand services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions. In May 2019, an executive\norder was issued invoking national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition\nor transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national security risks. The executive order is subject to\nimplementation by the Secretary of\n37\nTable of Contents\nCommerce and applies to contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the\nU.S. Department of Commerce issued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS\ntransactions that pose a national security risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as\nChina. Several aspects of this rule remain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule\nwill be implemented and enforced in practice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional\nrestrictions and may implement further restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese\ncompanies. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we\ncannot assure you that we will successfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and\nimplementation, these tariffs, the executive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could\nmaterially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased\npricing for customers, and reduced sales.\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations that are subject\nto varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as ours,\nuncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional taxes,\nfees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical presence\nor “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales of our\nplatform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus for\nsales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we have in the past\ninadvertently made and may inadvertently make our software products available to some customers in potential\nviolation of the EAR. Therefore, as warranted, we may submit voluntary self-disclosures regarding compliance with\nU.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security (“BIS”). For instance, in March 2022, we submitted a voluntary self-disclosure to BIS\nregarding our compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and regulations, which BIS closed out with a warning\nletter with no referral for criminal or administrative prosecution, and no imposition of monetary fines or\npenalties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\n38\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to, or respond to requests from law enforcement in connection with enforcement of, a variety of\nU.S. and international laws that could result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our\nbusiness due to changes in the laws, changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws,\nor investigations into compliance with the laws.\nWe may be subject to, or respond to requests from law enforcement that are legally valid, appropriately scoped, and\nsufficiently detailed in connection with enforcement of, various civil and criminal laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to protect user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. Our trust and safety team may take further action as appropriate,\nincluding suspension or termination of the participant's account or referral to law enforcement. The laws in this\narea are currently in a state of flux and vary widely between jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that\nin the future we and our competitors may be subject to legal actions along with the users who shared such content.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal liability we may face, our reputation could be harmed should there be an\nincident generating extensive negative publicity about the content shared on our platform. Such publicity would\nharm our business.\nChanges in law or policy could compel us or limit our ability to engage in content moderation, or otherwise limit\nthe ability of users to engage in inappropriate or harmful behavior, and could expose us to liability.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 provides\nprotection for providers of online service from liability for content produced by third parties and protects the\nright to engage in moderation of user content. The current administration and many members of Congress from both\nparties support the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional action remains. In\naddition, the FCC is considering a petition to adopt rules interpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of\ninternet platforms for third-party content that is transmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of\noffensive content. No date has been set for a vote on that proposal, and the FCC has not released any document\ndescribing the rules that would be proposed. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition. If\nCongress revises or repeals Section 230 or the FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of\nprotection offered by Section 230. In addition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in\nchanges to the protections afforded to internet platforms, including a lawsuit that, if successful, would greatly\nlimit the scope of Section 230. The U.S. Supreme Court recently declined to limit the applicability of Section 230\nin certain circumstances, but future cases may not yield the same results and a recent decision by the U.S. Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit would limit the applicability of Section 230 to curated content. These various\nefforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the risks faced by internet-based\nbusinesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in\nliability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for\nour customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business\nmethods, or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas that is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses\noperating on the Internet to moderate user-generated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections\ngranted under Section 230. Similar legislation has been introduced in other states. Implementation of the Florida\nand Texas statutes has been stayed by various federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 18, 2022,\nthe parties in the Florida case requested, and were granted, a stay of the appeals court mandate pending Supreme\nCourt review. On September 16, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision upholding\nthe Texas law. On September 30, the parties in that case filed an unopposed motion to stay the Fifth Circuit\ndecision pending Supreme Court review, and the Fifth Circuit granted that request on October 13, 2022. On September\n29, 2023, the Supreme Court announced that it would review both the Florida and Texas decisions, and on July 1,\n2024, the Court issued a decision returning both cases to the trial courts for additional analysis. The district\ncourt in Texas, on August 29, 2024, issued a decision staying some portions of the Texas law and allowing others to\ngo into effect, relying on analysis under both Section 230 and the First Amendment, and on November 18, 2024, the\nFifth Circuit issued an order setting parameters for the district court's consideration of the issues raised by the\nSupreme Court. The district court in Florida set a trial date in its case for June 2025. Florida amended its\nstatute in an effort to address issues that led the court to issue the stay. It is likely that any other such state\nlegislation also would be challenged under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it\nis preempted by Section 230. In addition, on August 27, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nissued a decision limiting the protections afforded by Section 230 in cases where a social media company curates\nuser feeds to the extent that the feed becomes the speech of the company, reversing a trial court decision that\n39\nTable of Contents\nimmunized the company under Section 230. We cannot predict whether any such state legislation will be adopted,\nenforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nFurthermore, new laws and regulations have been enacted or are being considered that impose extensive obligations\nregarding online safety and the operation of online services or platforms, such as the OSA and DSA, which may\nincrease our compliance costs, require changes to our processes, operations, and business practices. For example,\nthese new laws and regulations may seek to regulate the sharing of user‑generated content and require us to\nidentify, mitigate, and manage the risks of harm to users from illegal or harmful content. Violating these\nobligations could carry significant consequences. For example, violating the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of\ntotal annual worldwide revenue and violating the OSA can result in audits, inspections, and fines of up to £18\nmillion or 10% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. The Supreme Court currently is considering a challenge to the USF contribution rules that could\naffect how such contributions are collected from services providers like us. Congress or the FCC may expand the\nscope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In addition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common\ncarrier or telecommunications service could result in additional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do\nnot comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could ultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any\nenforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly\nimpair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers and harm our business.\nAs described above, the FCC has reinstated its prior network neutrality regulations, but the FCC order was reversed\nby the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Part 1A. Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with\nbroadband access could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly\nleading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform. Changes in\nFCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations on our\nother services. Such action could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications\nservices like the ones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could\nbe required to modify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such\nregulation could result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nOn December 13, 2023, the FCC adopted revised rules on reporting of breaches of private customer information, known\nas CPNI. The revised rules could broaden the types of CPNI breaches that must be reported, but also could limit the\nnumber of reports that must be filed by adopting a minimum threshold for the number of customers affected and not\nrequiring reporting in certain circumstances when customers are not harmed. The rules also require that breach\nreports be provided directly to the FCC, which could increase the risk of enforcement action, including fines and\nbehavioral remedies. These rules are not yet in effect and have been challenged in federal court. We cannot predict\nthe impact of the new rules on our operations or business or whether they will be overturned in court.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that prohibit Chinese companies that are deemed to be a national security risk by other\nfederal agencies from obtaining new authorizations and placed on a list known as the Covered List to sell\ntelecommunications equipment in the U.S. and is considering proposed rules that would ban those companies from\nselling previously-authorized equipment or could prohibit the use of their equipment in the U.S. Zoom does not\ncurrently have any equipment from the companies subject to the ban in its network, but if other companies are added\nto the Covered List and the FCC adopts rules that ban sales or use of equipment from such companies, we could be\nrequired to find new sources for similar equipment or replace existing equipment entirely.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer. The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted an order\nrequiring VoIP providers like Zoom Phone\n40\nTable of Contents\nto obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass USF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to\nour customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in our products becoming more expensive. We expect\nthat state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to\nservices like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our\nbusiness, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, and we may have to restructure our product\nofferings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nCertain states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the\nconduct of broadband providers. California’s state-specific network neutrality law has taken effect and Vermont’s\nlaw took effect, but a challenge to that law remains pending. The FCC’s April 25 order permits it to preempt any\nstate-level network neutrality requirements that go beyond the requirements adopted in that order, but specifically\nheld that the California law would not be preempted. The FCC order was stayed on August 1, 2024, pending resolution\nof an appeal. For additional information on this order, see the risk factor titled “Failures in internet\ninfrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to believe that our\nsystems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel their\nsubscriptions to our platform.” We cannot predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced, modified,\noverturned, or vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. Some companies, including some of our\ncompetitors, own large numbers of patents, as well as valuable copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to\nassert claims against us. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility\nof intellectual property rights claims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the\npast been, are currently, and may from time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes\nrelated to our use of intellectual property, our business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend\nthese lawsuits vigorously and believe that we have valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and\ntime consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade\npotential customers from subscribing to our services, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to\nthese lawsuits, there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle\nlitigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that\nmay not be reversible upon appeal. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of\nour operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger\ncustomers include certain provisions for indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third\nparty’s intellectual property rights, which could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course\nof any litigation or dispute, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other\ninterim developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price\nof our Class A common stock may decline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to\nseek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on\nreasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may\nnot be available to us at all, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices\nor discontinue the practices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require\nsignificant effort and expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, trademark and domain name protection,\ntrademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants,\nand third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make business decisions about\nwhen to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright or trade secret\nprotection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent\nprotection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of\nour products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our\n41\nTable of Contents\ntrademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If\nwe do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that\nwe have developed in those trademarks could be lost, diminished or impaired, which could harm our brand and our\nbusiness. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property or proprietary rights;\nthird parties may challenge our intellectual property or proprietary rights; our pending and future patent,\ntrademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to prevent infringement without\nincurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary\ntechnologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part\non trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These\nagreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate\nremedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may develop similar\ntechnologies or processes, or independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to\nassert our trade secret rights. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of\nintellectual property protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as rights to patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the\nlegal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of\npatents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in\nprotecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be\nexposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other\nintellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive\ninformation. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to\nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming\nlitigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of\nour proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform,\nbrand, and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our\nplatform and its features. Any of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software (including our open\nsource AI models) in our technologies. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third\nparties under open source licenses. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have\nfaced claims challenging the use of such open source software and requesting compliance with the open source\nsoftware license terms. Accordingly, we may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to\nbe open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open\nsource software licenses require end-users who use, distribute or make available across a network software and\nservices that include open source software to offer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source\nsoftware for no cost. We may also be required to make publicly available source code (which in some circumstances\ncould include valuable proprietary code) for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating\nor using the open source software and/or to license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the\nparticular open source license. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source\nsoftware into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose our source code that\nincorporates or is a modification of such licensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and\ncomply with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we\nmay inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with\nthe terms of their licenses, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of\ncontract. Furthermore, there exists today an increasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost\nnone of which have been tested in courts of law to provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we\nwere to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses, we could be required\nto publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code. We could also be required to expend\nsubstantial time and resources to re-engineer some of our software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our\nbusiness. Furthermore, with respect to our use of third party open source AI models, some licenses to third party\nopen source AI models contain additional use restrictions pertaining to research-only limitations or, in some\ncases, vague notions of responsible uses for the AI models, which may not in all instances comport with our\nbusiness practices.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could\ncause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations\nin the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral political, social, economic and market conditions, in both domestic and our foreign markets, including\neffects of increased interest rates and inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020 and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2025, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 61.8% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n57.0% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2025, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.2% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 31.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one\nshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or\nincapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing\nservices to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of\nthe then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary\nof the closing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\n44\nTable of Contents\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications and collaboration platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using\nlegacy communication methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product\nfeature that every customer or user wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform\ndoes not provide. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over\ntime, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market\nopportunity estimates will purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even\nif the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow\nfor a variety of reasons outside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks\nmaterializes, it could harm our business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health\ndevelopments could have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could\ninclude business and service disruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our\nemployees' ability to travel to support our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In\naddition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market\ndata. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an\nexit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are currently depressed and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the\ncompanies we have invested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are\ninherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and\ntiming of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to\nmitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for\na set period of time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment\ncapital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies\ncould be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, particularly during times of market volatility and\ngeneral economic instability. The need for additional liquidity may also be affected by the federal government’s\npotential failure to raise the debt ceiling or correct a prolonged banking or financial crisis. If we raise\nadditional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have\nrights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may\nexperience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources in our accounting, legal and IT organizations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Recently, the SEC has alleged violations of internal controls\nat other public companies, even in the absence of an underlying accounting or disclosure\n47\nTable of Contents\nviolation, which significantly increases the enforcement risk faced by us and other public companies for any\nweaknesses in disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting.\nIneffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause\ninvestors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative\neffect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these\nrequirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual\nmanagement report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\nRegulators', investors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social\nand governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, customers and other stakeholders concerning environmental,\nsocial and governance matters. To the extent we share information about our practices in this area, we could be\ncriticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. In addition, we may communicate related\ngoals or initiatives from time to time, which can be costly to achieve and difficult to implement. There is no\nassurance that we will achieve any of these goals, that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcome, and\nour ability to implement these initiatives or achieve these goals may be dependent on external factors outside our\ncontrol. Further, we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, or\nother stakeholders who disagree with our actual or perceived positions, or with our lack of position on social,\nenvironmental, governance, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical, or other sensitive issues. Any\nperceived lack of transparency about these matters could harm our brand and reputation, our employees’ engagement\nand retention, and the willingness of our customers and partners to do business with us.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nThere are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. We have a global workforce, and operate in\nleased office spaces and data centers, and the short, medium and long term climate impacts to our business are\nunclear.\n48\nTable of Contents\nChanging market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather\nevents to infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our\nthird-party suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs\nto maintain or resume operations. In addition, we may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements,\nstandards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business."

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have designed and implemented an information security program that is tailored to our operations and\ninfrastructure, the nature of our products and services, and the sensitivity of data. Our information security\nprogram consists of processes that are designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats.\nWe have implemented cybersecurity risk management processes that include, for example, vulnerability assessments,\napplication security assessments, penetration testing, third party security assessments, security audits, and\nongoing risk assessments.In addition, we have implemented certain technical, physical, and organizational\nsafeguards designed to mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats, including, for example, depending on the\nenvironment or system: information security policies and standards, data protection policies and standards,\nsecurity training and awareness campaigns, information protection processes, and systems monitoring for\ncybersecurity threats. We have also implemented an Incident Response Plan and procedures that provide us with a\nframework for responding to cybersecurity incidents. The Incident Response Plan and procedures provide protocols\nfor incident evaluation, including the use of third-party service providers, processes for notification, and\ninternal escalation of information to our senior management and the appropriate Board committee(s), all as\nappropriate depending on the nature of the incident. The Incident Response Plan is reviewed and updated, as\nnecessary, under the leadership of Zoom’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”).\nFurther, our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are an important element of our\noverall enterprise risk management program and included in our annual enterprise risk assessment which we provide\nto senior management and the Board.\nWe use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats, including for example: professional services firms (including legal counsel), threat\nintelligence service providers, cybersecurity consultants, cybersecurity software and managed service providers,\npenetration testing firms, and forensic investigators.\nWe have a third party risk management program designed to oversee, identify, and mitigate material risks from\ncybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers. We perform risk-based due diligence\nand ongoing monitoring of third parties, which may include, for example: reviewing the third party’s relevant\nsecurity audits and assessments, conducting our own security assessments, and imposing contractual obligations\nrelated to information security.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition.For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially\naffect us and how they may do so, see the risk factor titled \"Our security measures, and those of the third parties\nwith whom we work, have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security measures\nare compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation, expose us to\nsignificant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products and services\nmay be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and users curtailing or ceasing their\nuse of our products, us incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed\" in Part I, Item 1A. Risk\nFactors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Board addresses our cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. As outlined in its\ncommittee charter, the Cybersecurity Risk Management Committee of the Board (“Cybersecurity Risk Committee”)\nassists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility. Our CISO, Michael Adams, leads the team responsible\nfor implementing and maintaining our information security program and reports directly to the Chief Operating\nOfficer (“COO”), who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Mr. Adams is a graduate of the United\nStates Naval Academy and brings nearly 30 years of security and leadership experience, including serving as Deputy\nGeneral Counsel of NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command, Deputy General Counsel of the\nUnited States' Military's Pacific Command, and Deputy\n49\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Counsel for two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as an executive at a\nleading technology company. Mr. Adams previously served as Zoom's Chief Counsel to the COO and CISO.\nThe CISO provides regular briefings to our senior management and the Cybersecurity Risk Committee concerning\nrelevant cybersecurity risks and the processes we have implemented to address them. The Cybersecurity Risk\nCommittee and the Board also receive various reports, summaries, and presentations related to cybersecurity\nthreats, risks, and mitigations."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nZoom Workplace with AI Companion is an open, AI-first work platform for human connection. Our platform is designed\nto enable seamless communication and collaboration through a suite of products that includes Zoom Meetings, Zoom\nPhone, Zoom Team Chat, and Zoom Docs, and more, all powered by AI to improve productivity, collaboration, and\nbusiness outcomes.\nWe strive to simplify the workday with tools that drive meaningful team collaboration and customer engagement. Zoom\nWorkplace, our AI-driven platform, supports businesses by providing an open, scalable solution for communication\nand collaboration. This includes Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Revenue Accelerator, and Zoom Events, which empower\nsales, marketing, and customer experience teams to foster stronger customer relationships.\nAI is core to Zoom’s product innovation. In fiscal year 2025, Zoom continued to invest in AI and focused on three\nkey areas regarding AI: supporting individual productivity, powering better collaboration, and helping customer-\nfacing teams deliver meaningful business value and delight to their customers. Our federated approach to AI enables\nusers to leverage multiple AI models (including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta), making AI more accessible\nand affordable so that more people can incorporate them in their day-to-day workflows. In line with our commitment\nto responsible AI, Zoom does not use customer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or other\ncommunications (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party AI models.\nZoom’s platform prioritizes security and privacy, with 32 co-located data centers globally and robust encryption.\nWe are committed to delivering high-quality, real-time video, even in low-bandwidth conditions, while safeguarding\nour customers' data.\nRevenue is driven by subscriptions to Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. Our core offerings include Zoom\nWorkplace Pro, Business, and Enterprise bundles, with vertical-specific plans for Education, Healthcare, and\nGovernment. We also offer Zoom Phone, with regional and global calling plans designed to meet diverse customer\nneeds.\nOur revenue was $4,665.4 million, $4,527.2 million, and $4,393.0 million for the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 3.1% and 3.1%, respectively. We had net\nincome of $1,010.2 million, $637.5 million, and $103.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024,\nand 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,945.3 million, $1,598.8 million, and\n$1,290.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nMacroeconomic Conditions and Other Factors\nThe macroeconomic environment including geopolitical conflicts, tariffs and trade tensions, inflationary pressures,\ninterest rate fluctuations, and foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues to create uncertainty in demand\nfor subscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform. These factors, along with responses by\ncentral banks and government policies, have placed pressure on consumer and business behavior, leading to elongated\nsales cycles and increased scrutiny of IT budgets among existing and potential customers. For the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2025, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we experienced continued growth in total\nrevenue and revenue from Enterprise customers. However, several factors have impacted and may continue to impact\nour growth rate, such as higher market penetration, increased competition, and the maturation of our business,\namong others.\nWhile we have seen improvement in the macroeconomic environment in recent periods, we continue to monitor the\npotential effects of these circumstances as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape on our\nbusiness and financial results, as well as the overall global economy. The implications of macroeconomic conditions\non our business, results of operations, and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain\nuncertain.\nRefer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussions of the\npotential impacts of the current macroeconomic conditions on our business.\n52\nTable of Contents\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers who use Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. Our\noperating results and growth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we\nbelieve there is a significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer\nadoption rates or the future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to\ninvest in sales and marketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented\nsales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Historically,\ncustomers have increased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across\ntheir operations. Over the past few years, macroeconomic headwinds have resulted in slower hiring and higher seat\ncount downsells from our existing Enterprise customers in key markets that has impacted the rate of expansion and\nhave caused our net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers to drop below one hundred percent. Despite the\ndecline in our rate of expansion, we believe there are still opportunities for future growth with our existing\ncustomers as we innovate our platform with additional product offerings and the use of AI. This expansion in the\nuse of our platform also provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers,\nsuch as Zoom Phone, Contact Center, and Workvivo. In order for us to address this opportunity and expand the use of\nour products with our existing customers, we will need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new\nfeatures and functionality that are responsive to our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing Enterprise customers through our net dollar expansion rate. We define\nEnterprise customers as distinct business units who have been engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers,\nor strategic partners. Revenue from Enterprise customers represented 59.0%, 57.9% and 54.8% of total revenue for\nthe fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the\nincrease in user adoption within our Enterprise customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven by the\nnumber of paid licenses within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our subscription\nrevenue from the same set of Enterprise customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion rate\nas of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all Enterprise customers as of 12\nmonths prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from\nall customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying\nit by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all Enterprise customers\nfor the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication\nthat they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these Enterprise customers as of the\ncurrent period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contractions, and attrition. We divide the\nCurrent Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For the trailing 12 months\ncalculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12 months. Our net dollar\nexpansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our\ncustomer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Enterprise customers. Our trailing\n12 month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 98%, 101%, and 115% as of January 31, 2025, 2024,\nand 2023, respectively.\nRetention of Online Customers\nIn addition to Enterprise customers, we also have a significant number of customers who subscribe to our services\ndirectly through our website (“Online customers” or “Online business”). Online customers represent a diverse\ncustomer base, ranging from individual consumers to small and medium-size businesses. We continue to focus on\nacquisition and retention of our Online customer base through various strategies to improve the features and\nfunctionalities of our products and services. Revenue from Online customers represented 41.0%, 42.1%, and 45.2% of\ntotal revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The ability to retain\nthese Online customers will have an impact on our future revenue. The online monthly average churn for our Online\ncustomers was 2.9%, 3.1%, and 3.4% per month for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. One of the dynamics in the Online portion of the business is the MRR contribution from customers who\nhave retained Zoom services for a certain portion of time as these customers tend to maintain their subscriptions\nand contribute meaningfully to the Online business. As of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023 the percentage of total\nOnline MRR from Online customers with a continual term of service of at least 16 months was 75.1%, 74.2% and 72.0%\nrespectively.\nWe calculate our online average monthly churn by starting with the Online customer MRR as of the beginning of the\napplicable quarter (“Entry MRR”). We define Entry MRR as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements\nfrom all Online customers except for subscriptions that we recorded as churn in a previous quarter based on the\ncustomers' earlier\n53\nTable of Contents\nindication to us of their intention to cancel that subscription. We then determine the MRR related to customers who\ncanceled or downgraded their subscription or notified us of that intention during the applicable quarter\n(“Applicable Quarter MRR Churn”) and divide the Applicable Quarter MRR Churn by the applicable quarter Entry MRR to\narrive at the MRR churn rate for Online customers. We then divided that amount by three to calculate the Online\naverage monthly churn for the applicable quarter.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. For\nexample, we have introduced a number of new products and enhancements, including Zoom AI Companion, Zoom Docs, and\nongoing enhancements for Zoom Phone, Meetings, Zoom Rooms, Sessions, Webinars, Events, and Contact Center. We also\ndeliver Zoom Phone calling plans in more than 45 countries and territories as of January 31, 2025.\nWe recently announced several upcoming products, including Zoom Tasks, a custom AI Companion add-on, Zoom Workplace\nfor Frontline Workers, and Zoom Workplace for Clinicians. The custom AI Companion add-on is designed to handle\ncomplex tasks across our platform by integrating data from multiple sources, including third-party apps. Zoom\nWorkplace for Frontline Workers is an AI-powered mobile solution aimed at enhancing on-shift communications, task\nmanagement, and insights for frontline employees and their managers. Zoom Workplace for Clinicians is designed to\nautomate clinical workflows, leveraging healthcare AI to streamline clinical notes, reduce documentation overhead,\nand improve doctor-patient interactions. These products are expected to be generally available in the first half of\n2025.\nThird-party developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for\ncustomers and developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more\ndevelopers and other third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the\nubiquitous platform for communications and collaboration. We will need to expend additional resources to continue\nintroducing new products, features, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the\nvalue of our platform with their own applications.\nAn E2EE option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings with up to 1,000\nparticipants as well as on Zoom Phone for one-on-one calls on the same Zoom account. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same\n256-bit AES-GCM encryption to encrypt real-time media in meetings during transit that supports standard Zoom\nMeetings, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the feature is designed so that the device of the meeting host, or originating\ncaller in the case of Zoom Phone, as opposed to Zoom’s servers, generates encryption keys and uses public key\ncryptography to distribute these keys to the other meeting participants or call recipient. Additionally, Zoom’s\npost-quantum E2EE is now globally available for Zoom Workplace, specifically for Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone, with\nsupport for Zoom Rooms coming soon. We believe that the launch of the new security enhancement makes Zoom the first\nUCaaS company to offer a post-quantum E2EE solution for video conferencing.\nInternational Opportunity\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from the rest of the world (APAC and EMEA) represented 28.2%, 28.7%,\nand 30.5% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We use\nstrategic partners and resellers to sell in certain international markets where we have limited or no direct sales\npresence. While we believe global demand for our platform will continue to increase as international market\nawareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management\nattention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an\nenvironment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems,\nand commercial markets.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nAs Zoom continues to expand and evolve, we have seen an increasing overlap between our Enterprise and Online\ncustomer categories. Over time, customers with lower MRR are expected to move from Enterprise to Online as we\noptimize our sales strategies. While these moves do not have a material impact on other key business metrics, the\nnumber of customers between these two groups has become less meaningful as a key business metric. Therefore,\nbeginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we will no longer report the number of Enterprise customers as\na key business metric. However, we will\n54\nTable of Contents\ncontinue to provide this metric in the appendix of our investor deck through the end of fiscal year 2026, which\nwill be accessible on our investor relations website (investors.zoom.us).\nInstead of using Enterprise customer count as an indicator of our performance, we believe that revenue from\nEnterprise customers and the number of customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 month revenue are\nbetter indicators of our ability to grow and scale with larger organizations. These metrics better reflect our\nprogress in attracting and retaining high-value customers and scaling our business over time.\nAs of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had approximately 192,600, 220,400, and 213,000 Enterprise customers,\nrespectively. During the three months ended April 30, 2024, in order to enhance customer experience and improve\nefficiency, we transitioned approximately 26,800 Enterprise customers with lower MRR away from working with direct\nsales teams, resellers, or strategic partners. These customers are now considered Online customers and no longer\nincluded in our Enterprise customer total as of January 31, 2025. The impact of this transition did not have a\nmaterial impact on the percentage of revenue from Enterprise and Online customers, net dollar expansion rate, or\nOnline average monthly churn.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers who contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 31.0%, 29.2%, and 27.1% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025,\n2024, and 2023, respectively. As of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had 4,088, 3,810, and 3,471 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our penetration of\nlarger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metric, may calculate this metric differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP metric as\na comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025             2024            2023\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,945,308    $   1,598,836    $  1,290,262\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -136,560         -126,953        -103,826\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,808,748    $   1,471,883    $  1,186,436\nNet cash used in investing activities       $              -1,106,024    $  -1,183,689    $   -318,322\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing    $              -1,028,077    $      60,186    $   -936,942\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications and\ncollaboration platform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also\nprovide services, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are\ngenerally considered\n55\nTable of Contents\ndistinct from the access to our unified communications and collaboration platform. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract term which\ncan include a free period discount.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-\nlocated data centers, third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses,\namortization of capitalized software development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated\noverhead.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; certain indirect taxes; litigation settlements; corporate security and regulatory\nexpenses; and allocated overhead.\nGains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, Net\nGains (losses) on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestments.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable securities and effect\nof changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions\nwhere we conduct business.\n56\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of

The change in income taxes was primarily due to an increase in\nincome before taxes, increases in non-deductible compensation and other permanent items, and a reduction in tax\nshortfalls on stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. See Part II, Item 8, Note 12\n“Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\n59\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $7.8 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic\nfactors, such as geopolitical conflicts, tariffs and trade tensions, inflationary pressures, interest rate\nfluctuations, and the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These factors and other risks detailed in\nthe section titled “Risk Factors” could impact the timing of cash collections from our customers. However, based on\nour current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable\nsecurities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the\nnext 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We believe we will meet longer-term expected\nfuture cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and\navailable cash balances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth\nrate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales\nand marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses associated with our international\nexpansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces\nas well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in\ncomplementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may choose or be\nrequired to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from\noutside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially\nand adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $          69,243    $                 27,171    $   29,529    $  12,303    $        240\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         470,102                     236,451       227,497        6,154               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         539,345    $                263,622    $  257,026    $  18,457    $        240\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,945.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, compared\nto $1,598.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The increase in operating cash flow was mainly\ndriven by higher net income year over year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,106.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 was due to net\npurchases of marketable securities of $964.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $136.6 million, and\npurchases of strategic investments of $18.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from strategic investments of\n$13.4 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,183.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was due to net\npurchases of marketable securities of $951.4 million, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $204.9\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $127.0 million, and purchases of strategic investments of $70.5\nmillion, partially offset by proceeds from strategic investments of $170.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $1,028.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 was due to\ncash paid for repurchases of common stock of $1,093.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common\nstock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $54.0 million, proceeds from employee equity\ntransactions to be remitted to employees and tax authorities, net, of $7.2 million, and proceeds from the exercise\nof stock options of $4.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $60.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was due to\nproceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $54.1 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from employee equity\ntransactions remitted to employees and tax authorities, net, of $4.1 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of our Class A\ncommon stock. In November 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.2 billion of\nour outstanding Class A common stock. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected, from time to time,\neither on the open market (including pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other\ntransactions in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nThe timing and the amount of any repurchased Class A common stock will be determined by our management based on its\nevaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using our working capital.\nAny repurchased shares of Class A common stock will be retired. The repurchase program does not obligate us to\nacquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued\nat any time at our discretion.\n61\nTable of Contents\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15,888,316 shares of our\nClass A common stock for an aggregate amount of $1.1 billion.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 “Summary of\nBusiness and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, the\nfollowing critical estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We apply judgment during the identification of a contract to\ndetermine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the\ncustomer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information\npertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the\ntransaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue\nrecognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform\nand related significant features. Sales commission is generally not paid upon contract renewal. Amortization is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2025, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\n62\nTable of Contents\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nStrategic Investments\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment that evaluates key factors including but\nnot limited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at\nwhich the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at\nfair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new\ncarrying value for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of 10% in\nenterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2025 would not have had a\nmaterial impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K."

                "content": "Item 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a portion of our revenue from\namounts denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the\njurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in Australia, China, Europe and the United\nStates. Our results of current\n63\nTable of Contents\nand future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, 19.3% , 19.3% and 20.0% of our revenue,\nrespectively and 16.4%, 13.7% and 10.8% of our expenses, respectively, were denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our\nbusiness would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been\nmaterial to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we\nmay do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and marketable securities of $6.4 billion as of January 31, 2025.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds and high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023.\n64\nTable of Contents"

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January\n31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n66\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,665\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2025.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 28, 2025\n67\nTable of Contents\nZOOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAssets

provides an open, AI-first work platform for human connection. Our culture of delivering happiness drives our\nmission and values and is fundamental to everything we do at Zoom. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in\nApril 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2025.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Communications,\nInc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation\nexpense, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of\ndeferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2025 or 2024. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we had $ 12.0million and $ 6.9million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities.See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\nAccounts receivable, net\n74\nTable of Contents\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2025            31, 2024\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        517,306    $        568,449\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -17,262             -25,916\nLess: Other reserves                           -4,816              -6,455\nAccounts receivable, net             $        495,228    $        536,078\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Other reserves generally represent a reduction of accounts\nreceivable with an offsetting reduction to deferred revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, our assessment took into account recent changes in macroeconomic\nconditions such as inflation pressures, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and uncertain\nenvironments, which may impact our estimates of credit and collectibility trends. Below is a rollforward of our\nallowance for credit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\nJanuary 31, 2025       January 31, 2024\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            25,916    $            24,900\nProvision for credit losses                     22,198                 47,267\nWrite-offs                                     -30,852                -46,251\nBalance as of end of year          $            17,262    $            25,916\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through gains (losses) on strategic\ninvestments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments.\n75\nTable of Contents\nPrivately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured at cost less any\nimpairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in gains (losses)\non strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment.For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we recognized an\nimmaterial amount of impairment to our privately held debt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications and collaboration platform during the\napplication development stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be\nused to perform the function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and\nequipment, net. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\nincurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s\nestimated useful life, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.We have\ncapitalized $ 14.9million, $ 8.1million, and $ 18.0million of software development costs during the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present\nvalue of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our incremental\n76\nTable of Contents\nborrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as\nour leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate\nthe interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the\nleased asset is located. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at\nor before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and when a\nsignificant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance\nleases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2025 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-\nlived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period\nof amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the\nuseful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine that the life of an\nintangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively\nover its estimated remaining useful life.There were noimpairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n77\nTable of Contents\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications and collaboration platform, which consists of one or more software-based services.\nOur customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we\nprovide a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications and collaboration platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a\nprofessional manner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include\nservice-level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and\npermitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits\nrepresent a form of variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements\nin the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and related services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the\nrelated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 1% of total revenue during the periods presented.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located\ndata center costs, third-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related\nexpenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments,\nand allocated overhead costs. Indirect overhead\n78\nTable of Contents\ncosts associated with corporate facilities and related depreciation, health care benefits, training, and other\nemployee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses based on applicable headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and\ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 50.8million, $\n56.5million, and $ 64.7million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards with only service conditions, including stock options,\nRSUs, and ESPP, are measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period. For RSU’s with service and performance conditions, expense\nis recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable the performance condition will be achieved. The\nprobability of achievement is assessed quarterly, and the effect of any change in the estimated number of\nperformance-based awards expected to vest is recognized in the period those estimates are revised as a cumulative\ncatch-up adjustment to stock-based compensation expense.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of assumptions, including the fair value of the\nunderlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock,\nrisk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and\n(2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related\ntax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions, which involve significant\njudgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these uncertain tax positions in a manner\ninconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income\ntaxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax liability.\n79\nTable of Contents\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options, to be participating securities as holders of such\nsecurities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common\nstock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures , which aims to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment\ninformation on an annual and interim basis to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses.\nASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 118.5million and $ 124.8million as of January 31, 2025\nand 2024, respectively, and the amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within other assets, noncurrent on\nthe consolidated balance sheets was immaterial as of January 31, 2025 and 2024.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 1,249.8million, $ 1,257.4million, and $\n1,140.7million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n3,801.9million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,353.7million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 2,448.2million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 59%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nGenerally, we do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid\nfor the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer\nlife and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform and related significant\nfeatures. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded\nduring the periods presented.\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition costs:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025           2024\n-in thousands\nBeginning balance                       $                 347,198    $   403,241\nAdditions to deferred contract                            246,727        214,657\nacquisition costs\nAmortization of deferred contract                        -282,103       -270,700\nacquisition costs\nEnding balance                          $                 311,822    $   347,198\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,\ncurrent (to be amortized in next 12     $                 188,358    $   208,474\nmonths)\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,                      123,464        138,724\nnoncurrent\nTotal deferred contract acquisition     $                 311,822    $   347,198\ncosts\n3.

We classify our privately held debt securities as Level 3\ndue to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, such as the probability weighting of the\nvarious scenarios that can impact settlement of the arrangement.\n84\nTable of Contents\n5. Business Combinations\nWorkvivo Limited\nOn April 21, 2023, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Workvivo Limited (“Workvivo”), a\nprivate technology company that provides an employee experience platform, for an all-cash purchase consideration of\n$ 221.8million. The acquisition extends our platform and offers our customers new ways to keep employees informed,\nengaged, and connected. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 184.7million was attributed to goodwill, $ 28.0million to intangible\nassets (primarily consisting of $ 10.8million to developed technology and $ 17.0million to customer relationships),\nand $ 9.1million to other net assets acquired. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing\nproducts expected to be realized from the acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nAt the date of the acquisition, the developed technology and customer relationships both had an estimated useful\nlife of 5.0years, and both are amortized using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful\nlives. Amortization of developed technology and customer relationships is recorded within cost of revenue and sales\nand marketing expense, respectively, within the consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2025, the\ndeveloped technology and customer relationships both had a remaining useful life of 3.2years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial. The results of operations of\nWorkvivo, which are not material, have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the\nacquisition. Pro forma and historical results of operations of the company have not been presented, as the results\ndo not have a material effect on any of the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations.\n6.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto five years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our Hardware-as-a-Service\n(“HaaS”) offering. We elect to apply the lessor practical expedient per ASC 842 and account for HaaS with customers\nas a combined performance obligation with the right to access our unified communications and collaboration platform\nunder ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach maturity, we consider\nvarious factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist to determine whether\nwe are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense for the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $ 26.7million, $ 24.9million and $ 32.7million , respectively, excluding\nshort-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was immaterial for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 .\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n2025\nReported as:                                  (in thousands, except life and\nAssets:                                                         percentages)                    2024\nOperating lease right-of-use          $                               55,900               $  58,975\nassets\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other current    $                               27,026               $  24,645\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities,                                          37,406                  48,308\nnoncurrent\nTotal operating lease liabilities     $                               64,432               $  72,953\nWeighted average remaining lease                                              3.3 years               3.7 years\nterm\nWeighted average discount rate                                           4.4  %                  4.1  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\n87\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025         2024         2023\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  31,197    $  26,471    $  27,120\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  21,760    $       —    $  13,857\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2025, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2025\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2026                                 $                  27,171\n2027                                                    18,017\n2028                                                    11,512\n2029                                                     9,658\n2030                                                     2,645\nThereafter                                                 240\nTotal operating lease payments       $                  69,243\nLess: imputed interest                                  -4,811\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                  64,432\n8.

Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2025, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 236.5million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 233.7million.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes,\n89\nTable of Contents\nthere is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and\nsurcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we recorded sales and other tax\nliabilities of $ 83.3million and $ 77.7million, respectively, of which $ 41.8million and $ 35.5million are included\nin accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 41.5million and $ 42.3million are included\nin other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based on our best estimate of\nthe probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of a probable outcome\nunder the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue subject to sales\ntax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant adjustments to the sales\nand other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for changes to\nthe assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in the future as we obtain\nnew information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took responding to\nlaw enforcement requests from the Chinese government. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of\nJustice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek\ndocuments and information relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our\nencryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public\nstatements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since\nreceived additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of\nthese investigations and have conducted our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing,\nand a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or\nother financial exposure, as well as reputational harm. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we recorded\nan $ 18.0million accrual with respect to a tentative settlement offer for the SEC matter that remains subject to\nSEC approval. We do not know when these matters will be completed, including the SEC matter, which facts we will\nultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We are\nunable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and are unable to reasonably estimate any range of possible\nloss beyond the $ 18.0million settlement offer for the SEC matter.\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors, and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. On October 27, 2021, a\nthird substantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated. The\nconsolidated case was stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On April 11,\n2023, the court entered a stipulated order that required defendants to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the\noperative complaint by June 12, 2023. On June 12, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated case.\nOn August 11, 2023, the plaintiff in the consolidated case filed an amended complaint. On October 18, 2023,\ndefendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 22, 2023, plaintiff filed her\nopposition to the motion to dismiss, and on January 26, 2024, defendants filed their reply in support of the motion\nto dismiss. On April 1, 2024, the parties notified the court that the parties are engaged in good-faith, material\nsettlement discussions, and requested that the court stay any proceedings and rulings in connection with the\npending motion to dismiss while the parties attempt to reach a proposed resolution of this action. On April 2,\n2024, the Court stayed the case. On January 14, 2025, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement\n(“Stipulation”) to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the release and\ndismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the matter, Zoom agreed to enact certain corporate\ngovernance reforms and to pay plaintiff’s counsel a fee award of up to $ 1.35million. The Stipulation and\nsettlement remain subject to preliminary and final approval by the court. On January 16, 2025, plaintiff filed a\nmotion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On February 6, 2025, the court held a hearing on the motion for\npreliminary approval of the settlement. We accrued the $ 1.35million fee award and recorded it as a general and\nadministrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2025.\nWe are vigorously defending ourselves against these lawsuits. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary\nstage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and\nsuccess on the merits,\n90\nTable of Contents\nexcept as otherwise described above, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may\nresult from these actions.\nOn April 7, 2020 and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our officers\nin the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of ours. The complaints\nallege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 by making\nfalse and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about our data privacy and security measures. The\ncomplaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On\nNovember 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a\nconsolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on May 20, 2021. Plaintiff filed an\nopposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the motion to dismiss was filed on\nAugust 9, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss. On\nMarch 14, 2022, we moved for reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss. On March 22, 2022, the\ncourt ordered plaintiff to respond to our motion, which plaintiff did on March 29, 2022. On April 22, 2022, we\nanswered the complaint. On March 8, 2023, the court denied our motion for reconsideration. On April 6, 2023, the\ncourt entered a scheduling order. On July 17, 2023, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreement of\nsettlement (the “Stipulation”) to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the stipulation, in exchange for the\nrelease and dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the matter, we have agreed to pay\nand/or cause our insurance carriers to pay a total of $ 150.0million. The Stipulation and settlement remain subject\nto preliminary and final approval by the court. On July 25, 2023, the court entered an order staying further\nproceedings in the matter pending the filing of a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On October 17,\n2023, lead plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. A hearing on the motion for\npreliminary approval was held on June 13, 2024, but the court has yet to enter a preliminary approval order. As a\nresult of the settlement, we made net payments of $ 60.0million ($ 150.0million for the settlement net of $\n90.0million covered by insurance) during the year ended January 31, 2024, of which $ 7.5million had been accrued\nduring the year ended January 31, 2023 and $ 52.5million was recorded as a general and administrative expense in\nour consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2024.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n10. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that are authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nCommon Stock\n91\nTable of Contents\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2025          2024\nStock options outstanding                        2,394,918     3,314,228\nRSUs outstanding                                23,870,513    26,040,557\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                 2,311,567     2,086,604\nRemaining shares available for future           56,022,675    50,559,254\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future           18,807,595    14,712,385\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock           103,407,268    96,713,028\nreserved\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 1.5billion of our Class A\ncommon stock. In November 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $ 1.2billion of\nour outstanding Class A common stock. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected from time to time,\neither on the open market (including preset trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other\ntransactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any\nspecific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15,888,316shares of our\nClass A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 1.1billion. As of January 31, 2025, $ 1.6billion of the\nrepurchase authorization remained available.\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time. In addition, the number\nof shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan automatically increases on February\n1 of each calendar year, starting on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the\ntotal number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of the fiscal year\nbefore the date of each automatic increase or (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors\nprior to the applicable February 1.\n92\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nStock Options\nOutstanding                    Weighted-\nStock       Weighted-    Average\nOptions         Average    Remaining               Aggregate\n(in thousands, except share,        Exercise    Contractual             Intrinsic\nlife and per share data)           Price    Life (Years)                Value\nOutstanding as of January                        3,314,228    $       8.21                  3.9    $    189,921\n31, 2024\nExercised                                         -908,844    $       5.08                         $     62,063\nCanceled/forfeited/expired                         -10,466    $      93.57\nOutstanding and\nExercisable as of                                2,394,918    $       9.02                  2.6    $    187,284\nJanuary 31, 2025\nThere were nooptions granted for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023.

A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019. During the fiscal years\n93\nTable of Contents\nended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, 1,066,977, 921,892, and 678,279shares, respectively, of our Class A common\nstock were purchased under the ESPP.\nAs of January 31, 2025, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $ 36.2million, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6years.\nWe estimated the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025                      2024            2023\nExpected term (years)      0.5-2.0                   0.5-2.0         0.5-2.0\nExpected volatility        28.4% -43.3%              30.0% -57.6%    57.6% -64.6%\nRisk-free interest rate    4.2% -5.4%                4.6% -5.4%      2.2% -4.8%\nExpected dividend yield    —                         —               —\nThe stock-based compensation expense by line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is\nsummarized as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,                2025            2024            2023\n-in thousands\nCost of revenue                                                $        124,561    $    143,798    $    174,546\nResearch and development                                                333,767         336,309         361,720\nSales and marketing                                                     319,631         381,298         532,371\nGeneral and administrative                                              153,350         195,756         217,115\nTotal stock-based compensation                                          931,309       1,057,161       1,285,752\nexpense\nBenefit from income taxes                                              -176,463        -197,068        -199,971\nTotal stock-based compensation\nexpense                                                        $        754,846    $    860,093    $  1,085,781\nrecorded to net income\n11.

Based on the available\nobjective evidence during the year ended January 31, 2025, we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax\nbenefits relating to U.S. losses that are capital in nature and certain state deferred tax assets may not be\nrealized prior to expiration. Accordingly, we have maintained a valuation allowance against these deferred tax\nassets and intend to maintain the applicable valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to\nsupport a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.8million for federal income\ntax purposes, and $ 12.5million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if\nunused. We also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 22.4million, which have an indefinite\nlife.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 1.2million for\nfederal income tax purposes and $ 23.4million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development\ntax credits have a twenty-year carryover period while the state research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n96\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2025         2024         2023\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  41,772    $  30,404    $  19,171\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                   931          228          877\nGross decreases                                                     —            —            —\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                13,650       12,415       10,547\nGross decreases                                                   -19         -891            —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                     —         -384         -191\nAcquisitions                                                        —            —            —\nBalance, end of year                        $                  56,334    $  41,772    $  30,404\nAs of January 31, 2025, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 56.3million ($\n66.0million total, including $ 9.7million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2024, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 41.8million ($ 46.5million total, including $\n4.7million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2023, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 30.4million ($ 32.5million total, including $ 1.6million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 9.7million, $ 4.7million, and $ 1.6million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2025, all of the years in which net operating losses or tax credits were utilized\nremain open to examination by the federal and state tax authorities. We believe that an adequate provision has been\nmade for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement,\nand closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax\nbenefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we started capitalizing research and development expenses incurred\nbeginning in fiscal year 2023. These expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic research\nand fifteen years for international research. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax\nliabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. The cash flow impact will decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenditures\ncontinue to amortize.\n97\nTable of Contents\n13.

Segment Information\nOur CEO is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) of the Company. The Company manages the business activities\non a consolidated basis and all information provided to and reviewed by our CODM is compiled at the consolidated\nentity level. Therefore, we have only oneoperating and reportable segment. The description of the types of products\nand services from which the reportable segment derives its revenue is the same as those described in the Summary of\nBusiness and Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe measure of segment profit or loss that our CODM uses to allocate resources and assess performance is our\nconsolidated net income. The CODM uses net income to monitor results and to decide whether to reinvest profits. Our\nCODM does not assess segment performance or make decisions using asset or liability information.\n98\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the significant segment expenses regularly provided to the CODM as well as other\nsegment items:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025            2024            2023\nRevenue                                   $               4,665,433    $  4,527,224    $  4,392,960\nAdjusted cost of revenue(1)                                 984,916         908,283         912,913\nAdjusted research and development(1)                        500,177         430,117         393,548\nAdjusted sales and marketing(1)                           1,090,294       1,116,356       1,153,660\nAdjusted general and administrative(1)                      252,152         297,580         353,755\nStock-based compensation expense                            931,309       1,057,161       1,285,752\nInterest income                                            -340,474        -210,009         -54,103\nOther segment items(2)                                      -68,525          95,424          98,159\nProvision for income taxes                                  305,346         194,850         145,565\nSegment net income                                        1,010,238         637,462         103,711\nAdjustments and reconciling items                                 —               —               —\nConsolidated net income                                   1,010,238         637,462         103,711\n(1) Excludes stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses,\nrestructuring expenses, and litigation settlements, net\n(2) Includes stock-based compensation related payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses,\nlitigation settlements, net, gains on strategic investments, net, and other income, net excluding interest income\nThe following table presents our property and equipment, net of depreciation and amortization, by geographic\nregion:\nAs of January 31,\n2025\n(in thousands)          2024\nAmericas                             $            238,328    $  202,022\nAPAC                                               51,036        45,321\nEMEA                                               41,111        46,361\nTotal property and equipment, net    $            330,475    $  293,704"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n99\nTable of Contents\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected."
