                "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nWe build useful and engaging products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through\nmobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and\nlearn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and\nvideos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at\nlarge, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products, including:\nFacebook. Facebook enables people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with each other on mobile devices\nand personal computers. There are a number of different ways to engage with people on Facebook and build community,\nincluding Facebook News Feed, Stories, Groups, Shops, Marketplace, News, and Watch.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. It is a place where people can\nexpress themselves through photos, videos, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite\nbusinesses and creators. They can do this through Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, IGTV, Live, Shops, and messaging.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ngroups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, video, and Rooms.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\nFacebook Reality Labs. Facebook Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected,\nanytime, anywhere. Oculus Quest lets people defy distance with cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) hardware,\nsoftware, and content, while Portal helps friends and families stay connected and share the moments that matter in\nmeaningful ways.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Our ads enable\nmarketers to reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors.\nMarketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-\nparty applications and websites.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell\nadvertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing\nadvertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited\nto, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information\nonline or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Google, Apple,\nYouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people\nwho use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services,\nand to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our\nproducts. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products\nand services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies\nintroduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.\n7\nTable of Contents\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and VR increases,\nand as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to\nexpand. We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to\ndevelop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security,\nprivacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against\nabuse.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate in more than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also\ninvest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing,\ndistribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure,\nartificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer\nprotection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or\nsanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In\nparticular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data.\nForeign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different\nobligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example,\nregulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent\nto various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely\naffect our financial results. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove\nor restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications\nDecency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business\npractices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nthe Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Facebook relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been\nsubjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the\nIrish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in\nrespect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such\ntransfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland\nchallenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in\nSeptember 2020. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data\ntransfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other\nalternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operate material portions\nof our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of\nIDPC, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services\nused by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal\ndata of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union,\nand includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took\neffect and imposes data privacy-related requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in\nBrazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain\ntransparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the\nEuropean Union's ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products\nand includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of\nthese developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative\nproposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other\njurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business, such as liability\nfor copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing\ndata protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and\ncompetition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also currently, and may in the future be,\nsubject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to implement\na comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated\nby, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated\ncivil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to\nchange our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to\nother structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Facebook, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we\nbelieve that people are at the heart of every connection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where\nideas, innovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across engineering, product design,\nmarketing, and other areas to further our mission.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe had a global workforce of 58,604 employees as of December 31, 2020, which represents a 30% year-over-year\nincrease in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as\nwe continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a\nnumber of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review\ninitiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth.\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe.\nThe vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the\nlong term, we expect some personnel to transition to working remotely on a regular basis.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nDiversity and inclusion are core to our work at Facebook. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where\nwe can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the\nglobal community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do.\nWe publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data annually. In 2020, we announced\nthat as of June 30, 2020, our global employee base was comprised of 37% females and 63% males, and our U.S.\nemployee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 44.4% Asian, 41% White, 6.3% Hispanic, 4% two or more\nethnicities, 3.9% Black, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian\nor Other Pacific Islander). We also announced our goals to have 50% of our workforce made up of underrepresented\npopulations by 2024, and to increase the representation of people of color in leadership positions in the United\nStates, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also continue our ongoing efforts to increase\nthe representation of women in leadership.\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and\ninclusion. We employ our Diverse Slate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and\nhiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We\nhave seen steady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this\napproach in 2015. We also continue to provide diversity and inclusion training for our recruiting team and develop\ninclusive internship programs. Facebook University, our training program for college freshmen and sophomores with\nan interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach to promote participation by\npeople from underrepresented groups. To help build community among our people and support their professional\ndevelopment, we invest in our internal Facebook Resource Groups and our annual Community events such as Women's\nCommunity Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community Summit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer\nManaging Unconscious Bias, Managing Inclusion, and Be the Ally trainings to promote an inclusive workplace by\nhelping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of bias\nin the workplace.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2020, we announced\nthat our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity across gender globally and race in the United States\nfor people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Facebook, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones resources\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and\ntime away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, family care resources, a\n401(k) plan, access to tax and legal services, Facebook Resource Groups to build community at Facebook, family\nleave, and paid time off.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\nour ability to compete effectively;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nvolatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission;\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance\nhas been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active\nusers of our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that our active user growth rate will\ngenerally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and we expect that the size of our\nactive user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where\nwe have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced\nsignificant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic trends, and\nin each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we experienced slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in\nthe number of daily active users on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the\nimpact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to\nbe subject to volatility. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their\nengagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their\nactive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will\nnot experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have\nchanged over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different\nproducts and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement,\nincluding if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\n13\nTable of Contents\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that\nintegrate with Facebook and our other products;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe, or are otherwise limited in such\noperations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on\nStandard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union\nto the United States is invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-\nfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\ntake actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including\nas a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement;\nwe make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a\nresult of actions by us, third parties, or otherwise;\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare discontinued;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries;\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\n14\nTable of Contents\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making\nit easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nrevenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our active user growth rate continues to\nslow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and\nmonetization in order to drive revenue growth.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram.\nAs is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our\nmarketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not\ncontinue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not\ndeliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will\ngenerate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. We have implemented, and we will continue to\nimplement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads,\nwhich has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we\nare unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or\nmay decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\nadverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising,\nincluding developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize,\nincluding as a result of increased usage of the Stories format or our messaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\n15\nTable of Contents\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of European\nregulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon\nto transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative\npublicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our\nefforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or\nrecommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and web applications that are\nintegrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third\nparties, questions about our user data practices, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or\nuncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a number of marketers announced that\nthey paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on our products);\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of the use of data for ads, including as a\nresult of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with\nthe GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations, or regulatory\nactions, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types\nof marketers or within particular geographies.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have\naffected, and may in the future affect, marketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we have seen with\nthe regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in\nadvertising activity on our products. The effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our\nads, a related decline in pricing of our ads, and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of\nincreased usage of our services, and any similar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or\nincrease the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user\nactivity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party\nmobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact,\nthe availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver\nrelevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools\nthat incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our\nbusiness. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA,\nhave impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In\nparticular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types of ad targeting in Europe following\nadoption of the GDPR, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in\nCalifornia following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to\nmake additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals. In\naddition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced product changes\nas well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target\nand measure advertising. For example, in June 2020, Apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system that will reduce our\nand other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which we expect will in turn reduce the\nbudgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented,\nand may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to\nimprove ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our\nworldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have\nlimited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform, and negatively impacted our\nadvertising revenue, and if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future,\nour targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn\nsignificantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature Facebook or our other products, or that mobile device users will\ncontinue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of Facebook\nand our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that\nwe do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or\ntechnical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset\nmanufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our\nproducts' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential\ntreatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or\ncharge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of\nFacebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update\nto its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most\nrelevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and more recently announced changes to iOS 14 that will limit\nour ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expect that any similar changes to its, Google's, or other\nbrowser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and\nimpact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our\nproducts work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not\ncontrol, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem\nor in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or\nstandards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use Facebook or our other products on\ntheir mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use Facebook or our other products on their mobile\ndevices or use mobile products that do not offer access to Facebook or our other products, our user growth and user\nengagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products\nor the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may\nadversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no\nassurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are\nadversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth,\nengagement, and monetization could be adversely affected\n17\nTable of Contents\nand our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating\nsystems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the\nfuture may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer\nhardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may\nnot be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new\nproducts, or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also\ninvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to\nsupport increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and\nwe may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long\nterm. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging\nservices, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or enhanced products fail to engage\nusers, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users\nor to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business\nmay be adversely affected.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking\nalgorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial\nresults. From time to time, we may also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads in order to\nimprove ad quality and overall user experience. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other\nchanges to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and\ndevelopers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook or our other products. We also\nmay introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that\nattract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization. For\nexample, we previously introduced the Stories format, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as News\nFeed. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time\nthese efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in\nfavor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. These\ndecisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits\nthat we expect.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of\nour new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our\nability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new\n18\nTable of Contents\nproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands.\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive\nexperience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties\nthat advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny\nof our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, advertising, competition, and\nother issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the COVID‑19 pandemic, which has in\nthe past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, in\nMarch 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or\nappropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or\ndevelopers, or to otherwise address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence\nin our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or\ninappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of\nour products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate\nopinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related\npurposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or\nobjectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United States\nand around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent\nOversight Board, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who\nviolate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make\nsubstantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions, such as the\nforegoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and\nadvertising, hate speech, and other content, have eroded confidence in our brands, and if we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial\nresults may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web\napplications that integrate with Facebook and our other products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and\nweb applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may\nnot be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or web applications that create and maintain user\nengagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled\nby third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are\ncontinuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal\nuser experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such\ndevelopers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these\ndevelopers to users on Facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and\nsuch actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile\nand web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety,\nand security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these\nactions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or\nwill adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or\ngrow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or\nif we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue\nand also exposes our business to other risks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or\nmitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity,\nquarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business\nslowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted our\nbusiness and results of operations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10%\nyear-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering. While\nour advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent\n19\nTable of Contents\nquarters, there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic. In\naddition, we believe that the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to\nonline, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, which in turn have\nincreased demand for our advertising services; however, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue\nin future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our\nadvertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our advertising services may be materially and adversely\nimpacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such\nimpact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our\nbusiness, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as\na result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\ndecreased user engagement as a result of users' inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our\nproducts and services;\ninterruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from\nincreased usage, or product changes we implement to maintain accessibility of our services, such as reducing the\nquality of video to reduce bandwidth usage;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages, or diversion of our efforts and\nresources to projects related to COVID-19;\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising\npractices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or\nobjectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\nadverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of\nlimitations on our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as\nthe necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to\nperform;\nour inability to recognize revenue, collect payment, or generate future revenue from marketers, including from\nthose that have been or may be forced to close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn;\nincreased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nnegative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to\ndifficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us. The persistence of COVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread\nof the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operate our business and may materially\nand adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging\n20\nTable of Contents\nand optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including,\nbut not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and\ninformation online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example,\nGoogle, Apple, YouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract, engage,\nand retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and\nadvertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that\nintegrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual\nreality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as\nother companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in\ncertain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors\nmay be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to\ncompete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to\nnew or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger\nusers, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our\nproducts and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products\nand services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other\nproducts and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly,\nin which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our\nproducts more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating\ncompeting platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\nsearch engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated\ncompetitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has announced changes to iOS 14 that\nwill limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads\neffectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate\nadvertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we\ncannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\n21\nTable of Contents\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate\nwith Facebook and our other products;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other\nproducts;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become\nless attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and\nadversely affected.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our\nprivacy practices, terms of service, advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or\nregulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose\nproducts are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends,\nthe substance or enforcement of our community standards, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of\ncontent shared on our platform, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the\npast, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of\nsignificant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech,\nand other content, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics. In addition, we have\nbeen, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and\nother illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic\nand elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect\non the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which\ncould result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced\nsuch adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement;\n22\nTable of Contents\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result\nof the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of\ntime;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\nactions;\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\n23\nTable of Contents\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or\nactions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of\ndiscrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity\ninvestments, and in interest rates;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\nWe expect our rates of growth to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and to decline\nover time in the future.\nWe expect our user and revenue growth rates to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nalthough we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty. In the long term,\nwe expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases,\nand the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly as we achieve\ngreater market penetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our\nrevenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates experience volatility or decline, investors' perceptions of\nour business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and\naugmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for\nexample with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and\npromote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and\nunproven technologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding\noperations, including our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time\nto time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\n24\nTable of Contents\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our\nbusiness. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies. Some of these\ninvestments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only limited\nrevenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such\ninvestments to continue for the foreseeable future. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business\nand financial performance will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could harm our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, if\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on\ninvestment for our acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result\nin increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other\nrestrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our\nexpenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,\ndevelopers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes\nsuccessfully. Our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven, particularly with respect to\ncompanies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience. We\ncontinue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which will result in significant\nongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We\ncannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we\nacquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our service, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a\npotential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not\nbe adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays\nor outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access\nthem, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at\nall, and our ability to serve ads may be\n25\nTable of Contents\ndisrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As the amount and types of\ninformation shared on Facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our\nglobal community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an\nincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical\ninfrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures\nresulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism,\ngeopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. If such an\nevent were to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our\ntechnical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely\naffect our financial results.\nFor example, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our\ntechnical infrastructure. Additional product development efforts during this time have put additional pressure on\nour technical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate these demands, including as a result of our reduced\ndata center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the\nservices we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could\nsignificantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with\nthe services they provide. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor\nshortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we\nmay not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be\nrequired to procure such services or equipment on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\nemerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges,\namong others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects,\nincluding due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of\ncomponents, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges\nor actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead to increased\nproject costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or\nreliability of our products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related\nto this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may\nonly become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the\nuser experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United\nStates, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to such government action, could\nresult in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade\nthe quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of\nthese events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user\n(ARPU)) and Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)), are calculated using internal company\ndata based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable\nestimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring\nusage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to\nmeasure these metrics require\n26\nTable of Contents\nsignificant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or\nchanges in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time\nwe discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data\nlimitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do\nnot intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within\nthe error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Facebook metrics and Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology.\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our\nMAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate\naccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts\nwe look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of\naccess to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work\nremotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates\nof duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the\napplication of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously\nundetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users.\nDuplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number\nof duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user\naccounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our\nusers, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates\nof the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of our\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to\nindividual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible\nthat our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\n27\nTable of Contents\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our\nFamily metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of\ncalculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics,\nwhether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other\nfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics. Our estimates of Family metrics\nalso may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies,\nproduct changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our\nability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users.\nIn addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include\nsuch person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not\nconstitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP\nestimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting\nsolely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data is unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where\nwe discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may\nbe harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to Facebook or\nour other products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number\nof employees increasing to 58,604 as of December 31, 2020 from 44,942 as of December 31, 2019, and we expect\nheadcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of\nemployees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives\nas well as other functions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products\ncreate significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple\nrelationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number of our\nthird-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and\nprocedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of our management do not have\nsignificant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage such\ngrowth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact\nproductivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some\npersonnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating\nrecently hired personnel when our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to adapt to a\nremote work environment; improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems; and effectively\nexpand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement\nmore complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits\nof our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This\ncould negatively affect our business performance.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have\nmore limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that\ncould affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international\nmarkets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are\ngenerally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain\nmarkets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook and certain of our other products are not\ngenerally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If\nwe fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In\naddition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n29\nTable of Contents\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, data\nlocalization, payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to export controls, sanctions, and embargoes, including\nregulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a\nbroad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-\ncorruption laws or regulations, export controls, and other laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. We may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain that\ncould result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be\nnegatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on\nreasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties,\nmanufacturing constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\nsuch arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may\nbe negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by\ngovernments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment,\nand business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws,\nfails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as\nunethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines,\ncanceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\n30\nTable of Contents\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending\npatterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and other factors. The demand\nfor our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of\nsale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer\nhardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and\nmeeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer\nhardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,\ndetermine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain\ntypes of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable.\nAny one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the\npast, and may in the future, be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising,\nantitrust, privacy, content, employment, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer\nhardware and software, as well as virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example,\nwe are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data\npractices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\nour terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; and our acquisitions\nof Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct. We also agreed to settle certain\nlawsuits in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature on Facebook and a third-party cyber-\nattack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile\ninformation from user accounts on Facebook. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages\nor fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of\n31\nTable of Contents\nour non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our\nfinancial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such\ndetermination is made.\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States, could materially affect our tax\nobligations and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect. In addition,\nmany countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or\nrecommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\nProject, and issued a report in 2015, an interim report in 2018, and blueprints in 2020 that, if implemented, would\nchange various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\ncountries in which we do business. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals\nthat would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include\nchanges to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of\nnon-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several countries have proposed or\nenacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on social media platforms and\nonline marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax\nrate. For example, in 2020, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision\nfor income taxes by $656 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate\nwithout such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based\ncompensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of\nshare-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do\nnot control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely\naffect our financial results.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIf our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant\ncharge to earnings.\nWe review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the\ncarrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill\nfor impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect\nour results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and\nSheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the\nagreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies\nand systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of\nmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our\noperations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to\nmaintain our competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical\npersonnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such\npersonnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, whether as a result of\ncompetition with other companies, challenges due to the high cost of living, facilities and infrastructure\nconstraints, or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees\nprovided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue\nsignificant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial\nadditional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price\nvolatility. As a result of these factors, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our\nemployees. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and\nmotivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or\nsale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change\nof control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders\nsupport, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our\nother stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from\nacquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might\nharm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the\nmanagement and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to\ncontrol the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of\nour capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated.\nAs a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith\nin a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a\ncontrolling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control\nas governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will\ndiminish our cash reserves.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will\nenhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase\nvolatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of\nour stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, or that otherwise\nimpair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial\nresults.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor content available on Facebook or our other products in their country,\nrestrict access to our products from their country entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the\naccessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user\naccess to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user\naccess to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for\nother reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to\ntime. For example, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the\nability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found\nto be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required to\nor elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National\nSecurity Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. It is also possible that\ngovernment authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where\naccess to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue\nfrom a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese\ngovernment could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of\nthe trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or\nelsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which\ncould adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal\nrequirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate\nour Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that\ncontent shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in\nwhole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other\nrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic\nmarkets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other\nrestrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by\nmarketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and\nregulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business\npractices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise\nharm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content,\nintellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data\nlocalization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications,\ncompetition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce,\ntaxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance,\nsecurities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our\nactivities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws,\nregulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and\nother laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and\n34\nTable of Contents\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to\ncountry and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions\naffecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could\nadversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services\nor adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies to transfer such\ndata, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the\nUnited States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU\nupheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs is contingent on SCCs being held to\nsatisfy certain new conditions that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory\nguidance (and the European Commission has recently proposed new SCCs, which are currently subject to consultation).\nIn addition, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded\nthat Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR\nand preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review\ncommenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in\nrespect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC's right to apply to vary\nor lift this order), which we expect to occur in the coming months. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases\nfor data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to\nrely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we\nmay be unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the\nPrivacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. We have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and\nother jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its\nsharing of certain data with other Facebook products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the\nSupreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we\noperate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to\nprovide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could\nadversely affect our financial results.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services\nused by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal\ndata of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. As\na result, we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in\nEurope that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the GDPR. We also obtain consent and/or offer new controls to\nexisting and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. In addition, the GDPR\nrequires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator, the IDPC,\nand includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\nrequirements of the regulation. Similarly, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took effect and\nimposes data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and\ncreates new data privacy rights for users, including more ability to control how their data is shared with third\nparties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will\ncontinue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, regulators have recently issued new guidance\nconcerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. In\naddition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a\nnumber of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as\nwell as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In\naddition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity\nof delivering our services.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased\ncompliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational\nharm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business,\nincluding fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nFrom time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding\nour compliance with laws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and\nexpect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information,\nactions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data\nprotection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our\noperations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and\nother jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways\nin which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition,\nbeginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the\nUnited States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and\npolicies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which\nwas approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy\ncompliance and oversight. Beginning in September 2018, we also became subject to IDPC and other government\ninquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal\nuser access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. From time to time we also\nnotify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches\nand privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory\ncompliance.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and\ninvestigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to\nmany aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such\ninquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past\nacquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation\nof our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries\nand investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys\ngeneral. In December 2020, the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the\nDistrict of Columbia filed complaints against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging\nthat we violated antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions\non access to our platform, among other things. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent\ninjunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including\ndivestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties\n(including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner\nmaterially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time\nto time.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and\nlegislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business\npractices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and\nfinancial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the\nworld, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are implementing a comprehensive expansion of\nour privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order, including substantial management and board of\ndirectors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making\nmisrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to\nthe FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and\nwill continue to be challenging and costly to implement. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing\ndemand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in\ncompliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources internally to assist\nwith these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business\ninitiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some\npractices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe\nour ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will\ncontinue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require\nsignificant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent\norder and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time\nto time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or\notherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In\naddition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the\nFTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are\nfound to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or\ngovernmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or other\npenalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such\ninformation or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation,\ndissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of\npublicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, and breach of\ncontract, among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our\nprotection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws\nthan we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive expanding\nonline platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which\nmember states are required to implement by June 2021. In addition, the European Union revised the European\nAudiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to\nimplement by 2021. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various Congressional and executive\nefforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce\nlistings, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for\nthird-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating\nand defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders\nrestricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of\ncontent hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany has in the past, and may in the future, result\nin the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and\ndisclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have\nimplemented similar legislation imposing penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for\nfailure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to fines\nand may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey. In\naddition, Australia recently announced proposed legislation that would, among other matters, require us to pay\npublishers for certain\n37\nTable of Contents\nnews content that is shared on Facebook and Instagram. Content-related legislation also has required us in the\npast, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our compliance\ncosts, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example,\nthe European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content\nor to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial\ninvestments in compliance processes. In addition, changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act may\nincrease our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could\nadversely affect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nOur users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments\ninfrastructure on the Facebook website. In addition, certain of our users can use our Payments infrastructure,\nincluding on Messenger and WhatsApp, for other activities, such as sending money to other users and making\ndonations to certain charitable organizations. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United\nStates, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing,\nmoney transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, charitable\nfundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments product evolves, we may also be\nsubject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase\nflexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain\nmoney transmitter licenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-money) license that allows us to conduct\ncertain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the European Economic Area, which\nwill generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts\nto comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and\nmay still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or\nregulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order,\nor we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans\nto develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and\nadditional licensing requirements.\nOur participation in the Diem Association subjects us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could\nadversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIn June 2019, we announced our participation in the Diem Association, which will oversee a proposed digital\npayments system powered by blockchain technology, and our plans for Novi, a digital wallet for Diem which we expect\nto launch as a standalone application and subsequently in Messenger and WhatsApp.\nDiem is based on relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchain-based\npayments are uncertain and evolving. Diem has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in\nmultiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. As a sponsor of the initiative and a proposed\ndigital wallet service provider, we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators,\nand adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely\naffect our reputation and harm our business.\nAs this initiative evolves, both Diem and Novi may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United\nStates and international jurisdictions, including those governing payments, financial services, anti-money\nlaundering, counter-terrorism financing, economic sanctions, data protection, tax, and competition. In many\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with\nrespect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. To mitigate\nregulatory uncertainty, Diem has applied for a payment system operator license with the Swiss Financial Market\nSupervisory Authority (FINMA), and Novi has applied for money\n38\nTable of Contents\ntransmitter licenses in the United States and certain other countries, and other financial services licenses in\ncertain other countries, that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in these countries using the Diem\nnetwork. These licenses, laws, and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or\nimpede the launch of the Diem digital payments system as well as the development of our products and services,\nincrease our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, market acceptance of such a digital payments system is subject to significant uncertainty. As such,\nthere can be no assurance that Diem or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely\nmanner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based payments technology, which may\nadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services. We will also incur\nincreased costs in connection with our participation in the Diem Association and the development and marketing of\nassociated products and services, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), scraping, and\ngeneral hacking have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will\noccur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user\naccounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading\nmisinformation, or other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types\nand volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services\n(including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive\ntarget for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or\notherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of\nretaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user\nexperience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or\nresult in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to\ndisable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical\nmalfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our\nvendors' information technology systems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our\nfacilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to\nfraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users'\ndata. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for\nlong periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and\nuser data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or\ndetect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be\nable to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts will be successful.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nFacebook. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data,\n39\nTable of Contents\nwhich has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in\norders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate\nsuch incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could\nhave a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the security of\nour systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly. The rapid\nadoption of some third-party services designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce also may introduce\nsecurity risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services. We may also be subject to increased\ncyber-attacks, such as phishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for\ntargeting our personnel.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify\nadditional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy,\nsafety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications. As a result of these efforts we have discovered and\nannounced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user\ndata or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as\na result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the\nscale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19\npandemic, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents\nor activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, the media,\nor other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of\nuser data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or\nundesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's\nsafety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading\nmisinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect\nour business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and\nattention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and\ninternal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage\nimmense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain,\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise\nour ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and\nmay only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September\n2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely have in\nthe past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers\nwho use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms,\ncontracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors,\ncompromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions\nin our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how\ntheir data will\n40\nTable of Contents\nbe used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that\nmay prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or\ndefects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the\ntechnical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill\nour commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to\nour reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability\nfor fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we\ndeveloped available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of\nour open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these\nevents could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights\nclaims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other\nintellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products\nand services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number\nof intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we\nexpect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other\nintellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and\nthere can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may\nseek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation,\nincluding potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to\nsettle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are\na party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal.\nThe terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\nviolation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop\nalternative non-infringing technology or\n41\nTable of Contents\npractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could\nrequire significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise\nnegatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such\ndisputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $304.67 through December 31, 2020. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, as well as the\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018. We may experience more such litigation following\nfuture periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and\nthe attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do\nnot expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a\nreturn on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders\nwho hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and\ntheir affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nBecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B\ncommon stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are\nable to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common\nstock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated\ncontrol will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender\noffer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current restated certificate\nof incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult,\nincluding the following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\n43\nTable of Contents\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the\napproval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be\nestablished, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n44\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Legal Proceedings\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our\nplatform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer,\nbecame the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries\nin the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified\nconsent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020.\nAmong other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Any other government inquiries regarding\nthese matters could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business\npractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nOn April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California by Facebook users alleging that the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature violates the\nIllinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 16, 2018,\nthe district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both\nparties' motions for summary judgment. On May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our\npetition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On August 8, 2019, the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme\nCourt seeking review of the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties\nagreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for a payment of $550 million by us and\nwas subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and\nplaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the\ndistrict court denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice. On July 22, 2020, the parties executed an amended\nsettlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $650 million by us. On August 19, 2020,\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval.\n45\nTable of Contents\nBeginning on September 28, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the\nUnited States and elsewhere against us alleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action\nin connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user\naccess tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified\ndamages and injunctive relief. The actions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district court certified a class for injunctive\nrelief purposes, but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the\nparties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted\npreliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. We believe the remaining\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-\nattack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries. Any such\ninquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert\nresources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data\nProtection Regulation, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and\ninvestigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a\npreliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on Standard\nContractual Clauses in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily\nproposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be\nsuspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in\nthe Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in respect of the\ninquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC's right to apply to vary or lift this\norder), which we expect to occur in early 2021. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our\nbusiness is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data\nprotection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any\nsuch inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business\npractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations,\nformal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such\ninvestigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past\nacquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation\nof our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram\nin 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the\nthird quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and\nstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the\nDistrict of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging\nthat we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in\n2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that\nwe violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys\ngeneral both seek a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other\nequitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative class\nactions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of\nantitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive\nconduct, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we\nare vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to\nsubstantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources\nand the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and\nother regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of\nour legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user\ninformation in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and\npenalties against us. We believe we\n46\nTable of Contents\nhave multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we\nintend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional\nlegal proceedings and disputes."

We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities\nreduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020          2019          2018         2017         2016\n-in millions\nNet cash provided by\noperating                      $                   38,747    $   36,314    $   29,274    $  24,216    $  16,108\nactivities\nLess: Purchases of property\nand                                               -15,115       -15,102       -13,915       -6,733       -4,491\nequipment\nLess: Principal payments on\nfinance                                              -604          -552             —            —            —\nleases\nFree cash flow                 $                   23,028    $   20,660    $   15,359    $  17,483    $  11,617\n51\nTable of Contents"

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain revenue information in the section entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue\" is presented\non a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant\ncurrency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2020 using 2019 monthly exchange rates for our settlement\nor billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered\nin isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. This measure may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its\nusefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for\nyear-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency\nexchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides\ninvestors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison\nof financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows\nfor greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2020 Results\nOur key community metrics and financial results for 2020 are as follows:\nCommunity growth:\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.84 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 12% year-over-\nyear.\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.60 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 15% year-over-\nyear.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nFinancial results:\nRevenue was $85.97 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and advertising revenue was $84.17 billion, up 21% year-over-\nyear.\nTotal costs and expenses were $53.29 billion.\nIncome from operations was $32.67 billion and operating margin was 38%.\nNet income was $29.15 billion with diluted earnings per share of $10.09.\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $15.72 billion.\nEffective tax rate was 12.2%.\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nHeadcount was 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 30% year-over-year.\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on helping people stay connected, assisting the public health\nresponse, and working on the economic recovery. We have also continued to invest based on the following company\npriorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including\nprivacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set\nthe stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions\nof businesses that rely on our\n52\nTable of Contents\nservices to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our\nservices play in the world.\nIn 2020, we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products\nto connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.\nOur business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous\npreventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions,\nlimitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are\ncontinuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have\nsignificantly impacted our business and results of operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we\nexperienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic\ntrends, particularly in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on\nuser growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related\ndecline in the pricing of our ads, particularly in the second quarter of 2020. More recently, we believe the\npandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increasing\nconsumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, and we experienced increasing demand for\nadvertising as a result of these trends. However, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in\nfuture periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our\nadvertising revenue growth. The impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of\nour advertising services, as well as on our overall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the\nforeseeable future. In addition, we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely\naffected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory\nenvironment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\nWe intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities, and we anticipate that additional\ninvestments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling\nour headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2021. We expect 2021 capital\nexpenditures to be in the range of $21-23 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $68-73 billion.\n53\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and\ncapital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on\nmobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\nDAU/MAU:    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    67%    66%    66%    66%\n…        …        …        …\n…        …        …        …\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n54\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 11% to 1.84 billion on average during December 2020 from 1.66 billion during December\n2019. Users in India, the Philippines, and Indonesia represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December\n2020, relative to the same period in 2019.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 2.80 billion MAUs, an increase of 12% from December 31, 2019. Users in India,\nIndonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions\nare delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nThe share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our\nusers affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at\ndifferent average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively\nhigher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in\n2020 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.\nARPU:    $7.37    $6.42    $7.05    $7.26    $8.52    $6.95    $7.05    $7.89    $10.14\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\nNote: Our revenue by Facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our\nestimation of the geographic location of our Facebook users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This\nallocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements\nwhere revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $32.03, an\nincrease of 10% from 2019. Over this period, ARPU increased by 18% in the United States & Canada, 15% in Europe,\nand 9% in Asia‑Pacific, and ARPU was flat in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies\nwith relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will\nbe primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to\nincrease at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases\nin each geographic region.\n57\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as MAP or DAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our\nexpenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below)\naccess our Family products on mobile devices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDAP/MAP:    77%    78%    78%    78%    78%    79%    79%    79%    79%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 4% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020.\nWorldwide DAP increased 15% to 2.60 billion on average during December 2020 from 2.26 billion during December 2019.\n58\nTable of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors.

For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 3.30 billion MAP, an increase of 14% from 2.89 billion as of December 31, 2019.\n59\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. The share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $6.52    $5.66    $6.20    $6.33    $7.38    $6.03    $6.10    $6.76    $8.62\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $27.51, an\nincrease of 8% from 2019.\n60\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the\nlevels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such\nmatters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is\nmaterial . We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on\nour consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and\nestimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn response to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the assumptions and estimates\nassociated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material\nimpact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending on the duration or degree of the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.\nCollectibility Assessment of Revenue\nUnder Topic 606, we recognize revenue using a five-step model. In step one, for a revenue contract to exist, it\nmust be probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to will be collected. In\nperforming such collectibility assessment, we consider various facts and circumstances including future\nexpectations about our customer's ability and intention to pay. Collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold\nwhich requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factors, such as probability of default,\ncustomer’s intention to pay, payment history, financial strength, geography, and industry sub-vertical risks. The\ncollectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.\nCredit Losses of Accounts Receivable\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires the measurement and recognition of\nexpected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entity does not expect to collect over\nthe asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts\nof future economic conditions.\nFor accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, we use aging analysis, probability of default methods and\nincorporate macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses.\nThese macroeconomic variables may vary by geography, customer-type, or industry sub-vertical. The contractual life\nof our trade accounts receivable is generally short-term; however, we may experience increasing credit loss risks\nfrom accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current\nassessment.\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, there is significant judgment in\nevaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a\nnet basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are\ntransferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment,\ninventory risk, and discretion in\n61\nTable of Contents\nestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could\nimpact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.\nValuation of Equity Investments\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative,\ndetermining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may\nrequire judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as\nvoting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable\nprice for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal\nor most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely\nreporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the\ntransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a\nperiod subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative\nassessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook;\nindustry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash\nflows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we\nestimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and\nrecognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the\ncarrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash\nflows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose\nthe possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings,\nadvice of legal counsel,\n62\nTable of Contents\nand updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated\namount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12—Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful Lives\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible\nassets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated\nreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and\ntrade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair\nvalue are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable\nand, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable\nassets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized\nover the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During\nthe measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December\n31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The\nevaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash\nflows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying\namounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual\ndisposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is\nnot recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant\nimpairment charges during the years presented.\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining\nestimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts\nand circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as\nchanges to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted\nfor prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in\nuseful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.\n63\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile\napplications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered,\nrepresenting the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as\nimpression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on\na net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices, net fees we\nreceive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution\nof our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees\non our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with\npartner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content costs, credit card and other transaction fees\nrelated to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware devices sold.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, share-based\ncompensation, and facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible\nfor building new products as well as improving existing products.\nMarketing and sales.

Revenue in 2020 increased $15.27 billion, or 22%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly\ndue to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially\noffset by a decrease in the average price per ad.\nIn 2020, the number of ads delivered increased by 34%, as compared with approximately 33% in 2019. The increase in\nthe ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, and\nan increase in users. In 2020, the average price per ad decreased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of\napproximately 5% in 2019. The decrease in average price per ad during the year ended December 31, 2020 was\nprimarily driven by a decrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of 2020 due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as Stories\nads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates.\nIn the near-term, we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several\nfactors: the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of\ncommerce from offline to online, as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to\nservices, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the magnitude of fiscal stimulus; and the extent to which changes to the regulatory\nenvironment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers result in limitations on our ad targeting and\nmeasurement tools.\nAdvertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this\nseasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in\nadvertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth\nand subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 28%, 19%, and 23% between the third\nand fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of\n2020 and 2019 declined 16% and 10% compared to the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2020 compared\nto the same period in 2019, had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year\n2020 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar, our total revenue and\n66\nTable of Contents\nadvertising revenue would have been $86.08 billion and $84.30 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates,\ntotal revenue and advertising revenue would have been $120 million and $129 million, respectively, higher than\nactual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020. Using the same constant rates, full year 2020\ntotal revenue and advertising revenue would have been $15.39 billion and $14.64 billion, respectively, higher than\nactual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2019.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                             2020 vs 2019       2019 vs 2018\n2020              2019             2018              % Change       % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nCost of        $        16,692         $  12,770         $  9,355                    31  %                  37%\nrevenue\nPercentage                      19%               18%              17%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019. Cost of revenue in 2020 increased $3.92 billion, or 31%, compared to 2019. The increase was\nmostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, higher\ncost associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content costs and, to a lesser extent,\nan increase in cost of consumer hardware devices sold.\nIn 2021, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and\ntechnical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and\nservices and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with partner arrangements and consumer hardware\ndevices.\nResearch and development\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                              2020 vs 2019       2019 vs 2018\n2020              2019              2018              % Change           % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nResearch and    $        18,447         $  13,600         $  10,273                    36  %              32  %\ndevelopment\nPercentage                       21%               19%               18%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019. Research and development expenses in 2020 increased $4.85 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019.\nThe increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 40% growth in\nemployee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in engineering and other technical functions\nsupporting our continued investment in our Family of products and consumer hardware products.\nIn 2021, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our\ninvestment to support our research and development initiatives.\nMarketing and sales\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                            2020 vs 2019       2019 vs 2018\n2020             2019             2018              % Change       % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nMarketing       $        11,591         $  9,876         $  7,846                    17  %                  26%\nand sales\nPercentage                       13%              14%              14%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019. Marketing and sales expenses in 2020 increased $1.72 billion, or 17%, compared to 2019. The\nincrease was primarily driven by increases in marketing expenses and payroll and benefits expenses, which were\npartially offset by a decrease in travel-related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our payroll and benefits\nexpenses increased as a result of a 16% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020\nin our marketing and sales functions.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn 2021, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and\npartnership efforts, and we anticipate marketing expenses will increase.\nGeneral and administrative\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                           2020 vs 2019        2019 vs 2018\n2020             2019             2018             % Change            % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nLegal\naccrual\nrelated to      $              —        $   5,000         $      —                       NM                  NM\nFTC\nsettlement\nOther\ngeneral and                6,564            5,465            3,451                   20  %               58  %\nadministrat…\nGeneral and     $          6,564        $  10,465         $  3,451                  -37  %              203  %\nadministrat…\nPercentage                        8%               15%              6%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019.

Our provision for income taxes in 2020 decreased $2.29 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019,\nmostly due to the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion and the effects of\na tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes,\nboth discussed below.\nOur effective tax rate in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the\nFTC settlement that was not tax-deductible, the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth\nCircuit Opinion, and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development\nexpenses for U.S. income tax purposes.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, as part of finalizing our U.S. income tax return, we elected to capitalize and\namortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a total\nof $1.07 billion\n68\nTable of Contents\nincome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred\nincome tax asset that was greater than the current income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for\nthe periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which the increased current tax\nliability was accrued. We do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the\nfuture.\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v.\nCommissioner , which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share\nexpenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion ( Altera Ninth\nCircuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a\ncumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer\nrequested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer\nrequested a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020.\nSince we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation cost-sharing expense in the second quarter of\n2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in\n2020.\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from\nacquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of\nchanges in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 22,\n2021 price, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 will be in the high-teens.\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions\nthat have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and\nour effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of\nthis impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well\nas the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.48 billion which\nwere accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties\nrelated to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property,\nproviding services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate\nsettlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise\nchange the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of\ntax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12\nmonths.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not\nagree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January\n15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first sessions of the trial began in\nFebruary 2020, and additional sessions are expected to continue in 2021. The IRS did not provide any information\nabout how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe\nthat, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed\nU.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $680 million\n69\nTable of Contents\nin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not\nagree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the\nsecond Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes , that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in\nthe two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings\ncontinue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, for any adjustments\nto the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing\nof the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that\nthe balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number\nof years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full\nrange of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail\nin the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\n70\nTable of Contents\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a\npercentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020.

We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within\nthe next three years.\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27 million shares\nof our Class A common stock for $6.30 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases. In January 2021, an additional $25 billion of repurchases was authorized under this\nprogram.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $7.18 billion of the $61.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\nwas held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign\nearnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign\njurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our\nplatform and user data practices, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. We paid\nthe penalty of $5.0 billion in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. On April 21, 2020,\nwe entered into a definitive agreement to invest in Jio Platforms Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries\nLimited. The transaction closed on July 7, 2020, and we paid approximately $5.8 billion at the then-current\nexchange rate.\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our\noperational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities during 2020 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items,\nincluding $6.86 billion of depreciation and amortization and $6.54 billion of share-based compensation expense, and\noffset by a cash payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement. The increase in cash flow from operating\nactivities during 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items,\nsuch as depreciation and\n73\nTable of Contents\namortization, share-based compensation expense and deferred income tax, partially offset by the payment of $5.0\nbillion for the FTC legal settlement.\nCash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash\nitems, including $5.74 billion of depreciation and amortization and $4.84 billion of share-based compensation\nexpense. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to\nhigher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes\npayable as well as increases in the non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and share-based\ncompensation expense.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2020 mostly resulted from $15.11 billion of purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure, $8.16\nbillion of net purchases of marketable securities, and $6.36 billion of purchases of equity investments. The\nincrease in cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in purchases of\nequity investments and in net purchases of marketable securities.\nCash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from $15.10 billion of net purchase of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and $4.19 billion of net\npurchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018\nwas mostly due to increases in the net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $21 billion to $23 billion in 2021.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2020 mostly consisted of $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $3.56 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in\nfinancing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in repurchases of our Class A common stock\nand in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nCash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of $4.20 billion used to settle repurchases of our\nClass A common stock, and $2.34 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $552\nmillion of principal payments on finance leases. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2019\ncompared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital\nexpenditures, or capital resources.\n74\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments.\nOur obligations under operating leases include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, land,\ncolocations, and equipment. Our other contractual commitments are mostly related to our investments in network\ninfrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs, and data center operations. The following table summarizes our\ncommitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020:\nPayment Due by\nTotal                   Period\n(in millions)                     2021       2022-2023       2024-2025       Thereafter\nOperating lease\nobligations,\nincluding            $         20,751    $               1,316    $      3,017    $      3,065    $      13,353\nimputed\ninterest(1)\nFinance lease\nobligations,\nincluding                       1,088                      249             214             100              525\nimputed\ninterest(1)\nTransition tax                  1,543                        —             300           1,243                —\npayable\nOther contractual               7,504                    4,213           1,071             244            1,976\ncommitments\nTotal contractual    $         30,886    $               5,778    $      4,602    $      4,652    $      15,854\nobligations\n_________________________\n(1) Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of the business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to\npurchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally\nentered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume\nconsumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.94 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements\nmay vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\nOur other liabilities also include $3.48 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020.\nDue to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions\nis uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years\nbeyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal\nProceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n75\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity\ninvestment risk, and inflation.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in\nthe future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency losses of $129 million, $105 million, and $213 million were recognized in 2020, 2019,\nand 2018, respectively, as interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and\ncash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits,\nmoney market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\ndebt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our\nliquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents\nand marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $794 million and $525 million in the market value of our\navailable-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any realized gains\nor losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on\nthe carrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable market values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including recent and\nongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result\nin a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Our equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23\nbillion as of December 31, 2020.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nNote 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, and \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n76\nTable of Contents"

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for\nleases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the\nrelated amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n78\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. The\nCompany accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and\nthe amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. For\ncertain of these matters, the Company discloses an estimate of the\nDescription of the Matter                   amount of loss or range of possible loss that may be incurred.\nHowever, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the\namount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be\nreasonably estimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss\ncontingencies related to the various legal proceedings was\nespecially challenging due to the significant judgment required to\nevaluate management's assessments of the likelihood of a loss, and\ntheir estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence\nof a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses,\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the\nmeetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested\nand received internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss\nthe nature of the various matters, and obtained representations\nfrom management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the\nrelated disclosures included in Note 12 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n79\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nRedwood City, California\nJanuary 27, 2021\n80\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Facebook, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Facebook, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Facebook, Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nJanuary 27, 2021\n81\nTable of Contents\nFACEBOOK, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nFacebook was incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and\nbring the world closer together. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Facebook, Inc., its subsidiaries where we\nhave controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. None of these\nreclassifications had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives, collectibility of accounts receivable,\ncredit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, fair value of financial instruments, and leases. These\nestimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake\nin the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions,\nwhich may cause further business slowdowns or shutdowns, depress demand for our advertising business, and adversely\nimpact our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we faced uncertainties around our\nestimates of revenue collectibility and accounts receivable credit losses. We expect uncertainties around our key\naccounting estimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic . Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such\nchanges are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements .\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through\nagent.\n88\nTable of Contents\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\naffiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their\nrelationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party\npublishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements\nwhere we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts based on the expected\namount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our\nestimates of variable consideration.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) consumer hardware devices, net\nfees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\nDeferred revenue mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of revenue\nrecognition as well as revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various FRL\nproducts. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make\npurchases in games on our platform. Once this balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then\nbe payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue\nbalance for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying\nour performance obligations in FRL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized that was included in\nthe deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is\nnot significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or\nservices are delivered to the customer.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or\nless. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the\nright to invoice for services performed.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products.\nThese include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility\nand server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations\nteams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements,\nincluding traffic acquisition\n89\nTable of Contents\nand content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of\nconsumer hardware devices sold.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted\nand available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria\nfor capitalization were not material to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended.\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n90\nTable of Contents\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.26billion, $ 1.57billion, and $ 1.10billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90\ndays or less from the date of purchase.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-\nsale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current\noperations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of\ntaxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with\nan amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a\ncharge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining\nunrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders'\nequity. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not material. There was no\nimpairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019 and 2018. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of\nmarketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other\nincome (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank\nprovider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on\nthe consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\nEquity Investments\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable market values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The change in carrying value, if any, is\nrecognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically\nreview our equity investments for impairment. If indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is\nbelow the carrying amount, we will write down the investment to fair value.In addition, we also held equity\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Equity\ninvestments had a carrying value of $ 6.23billion and $ 86million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThere was no material impairment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n91\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were\nderived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our accounts receivable, net were $\n11.33billion and $ 9.52billion, respectively, and the allowances of accounts receivable were immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets\nor the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\nProperty and Equipment                     Useful Life\nNetwork equipment                          Threeto20years\nBuildings                                  Threeto30years\nComputer software, office equipment and    Twotofiveyears\nother\nFinance lease right-of-use assets          Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements                     Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations,\nchanges in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated\nor amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in\nmaterial changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.\nLand and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to\nthe construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their\nintended use.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such\nsale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n92\nTable of Contents\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data center, land, colocations, and equipment leases. We\nalso have finance leases for certain network equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.\nMost of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for\nmaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and\naccount for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent\nrent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Such variable lease costs\nare expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we\napply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease\nliabilities.\nFor leases that have greater than 12-month lease term, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheet at commencement date based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments. We\nconsider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar\neconomic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nResults and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic\n842 , while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 840.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a\nreasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the\npossible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions\nand changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and\nthe estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\nunasserted matters.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible\nassets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated\nreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users,\n93\nTable of Contents\nacquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and\ndiscount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but\nwhich are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nAllocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense,\nas acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived\nintangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one\nyear from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the\ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded to earnings.\nLong-lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and acquired finite-lived intangible assets for possible\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from\nthe use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not\nrecorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December\n31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived\nintangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized\nbalance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2020 we had a cumulative translation gain, net of tax of $ 439million and as of December 31, 2019, we had a\ncumulative translation loss, net of tax of $ 617million. Net losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions\nwere $ 129million, $ 105million, and $ 213million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nrespectively. These losses were recorded as interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements\nof income.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents\nconsists of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable\nsecurities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and\ndiversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was\nnot material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 42% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 43% of our\nrevenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 from marketers and developers based in the United States,\nwith the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China,\nCanada, Australia, Japan, Vietnam and Brazil.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\n94\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nSegments\nOur chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer who makes resource allocation decisions and\nassesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis. There are no segment\nmanagers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-maker, or anyone else, for operations, operating\nresults, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined\nthat we have a single reportable segment and operating segment structure.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFair Value Measurements\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair\nValue Measurements (Topic 820) , which improved the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and\nnonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements. The\nadoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCredit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326) : Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , using the modified retrospective transition method.\nUpon adoption, we changed our impairment model to utilize a current expected credit losses (CECL) model in place of\nthe incurred loss methodology for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including our accounts\nreceivable. In addition, we modified our impairment model for AFS debt securities and to discontinue using the\nconcept of \"other than temporary\" impairment on AFS debt securities. CECL estimates on accounts receivable are\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Allowance for credit\nlosses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our\nconsolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nexpected credit losses.\nIncome Taxes\nOn October 1, 2020, we early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying\nthe Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance was\neffective beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have\na material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-01,\nInvestments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity\nsecurities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for\ncertain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1,\n2021 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other\nOptions (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the\naccounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt\ninstruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for\nconvertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. This guidance will be effective for us in\nthe first quarter of 2022 on a full\n95\nTable of Contents\nor modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source consists of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020         2019         2018\nAdvertising      $                   84,169    $  69,655    $  55,013\nOther revenue                         1,796        1,042          825\nTotal revenue    $                   85,965    $  70,697    $  55,838\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the billing address of our customers, consists of the following (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020         2019         2018\nRevenue:\nUnited States and Canada(1)    $                   38,433    $  32,206    $  25,727\nEurope(2)                                          20,349       16,826       13,631\nAsia-Pacific                                       19,848       15,406       11,733\nRest of World(2)                                    7,335        6,259        4,747\nTotal revenue                  $                   85,965    $  70,697    $  55,838\n_________________________\n(1) United States revenue was $ 36.25billion, $ 30.23billion, and $ 24.10billion for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n(2) Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\nDeferred revenue and deposits consists of the following (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2020       2019\nDeferred revenue                       $           335    $   234\nDeposits                                            47         35\nTotal deferred revenue and deposits    $           382    $   269\nNote 3.\nEarnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for\nparticipating securities. We consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of\nsuch shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares.\nUndistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net\nincome attributable to common stockholders. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, adjusted\nfor outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase.\nFor the calculation of diluted EPS, net income attributable to common stockholders for basic EPS is adjusted by the\neffect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plans. In 2018, the calculation of\ndiluted EPS also included the effect of inducement awards under separate non-plan restricted stock unit (RSU) award\nagreements.\n96\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing\nthe resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common\nshares outstanding.\nRSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years\nended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2020                     2019                     2018\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916    $  18,411    $  3,701\nLess: Net income\nattributable to                                 —           —            —           —           -1           —\nparticipating\nsecurities\nNet income\nattributable to         $                  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916    $  18,410    $  3,701\ncommon\nstockholders\nDenominator\nWeighted-average                            2,407         444        2,404         450        2,406         484\nshares outstanding\nBasic EPS               $                   10.22    $  10.22    $    6.48    $   6.48    $    7.65    $   7.65\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income\nattributable to         $                  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916    $  18,410    $  3,701\ncommon\nstockholders\nReallocation of net\nincome attributable                             —           —            —           —            1           —\nto participating\nsecurities\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            4,539           —        2,916           —        3,701           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —         -58            —         -18            —         -16\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  29,146    $  4,481    $  18,485    $  2,898    $  22,112    $  3,685\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nNumber of shares\nused for basic EPS                          2,407         444        2,404         450        2,406         484\ncomputation\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           444           —          450           —          484           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive\nRSUs                                           37           —           22           1           31           3\nand employee stock\noptions\nNumber of shares\nused for diluted EPS                        2,888         444        2,876         451        2,921         487\ncomputation\nDiluted EPS             $                   10.09    $  10.09    $    6.43    $   6.43    $    7.57    $   7.57\n97\nTable of Contents\nNote 4.

Based on our assessment, we concluded no change in fair value from the\ninitial carrying value of $ 5.82billion was required as a result of these observable transactions. Had there been a\nchange in the fair value, our investment in Jio would be classified within Level 3.

Noamount had been drawn down under this credit\nfacility, and it was terminated on December 24, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had nooutstanding long-term debt.\nNote 12.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nGuarantee\nIn 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank\nprovider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating\nentities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of\neach day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool,\nany overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nWe also have $ 7.50billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, which are mostly\nrelated to our investments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs and data center operations.\nThe majority of these commitments are due within five years.\nLegal and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as\n103\nTable of Contents\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and\npolicies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, twoputative class\nactions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers\nalleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second\nquarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described\nabove relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our\nmotion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a\nsecond amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the\ndistrict court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16,\n2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our platform and user data\npractices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve\nthe FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our\nsettlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the\neffectiveness of the modified consent order.\nOn April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California by Facebook users alleging that the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature violates the\nIllinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 16, 2018,\nthe district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both\nparties' motions for summary judgment. On May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our\npetition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On August 8, 2019, the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme\nCourt seeking review of the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties\nagreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for a payment of $ 550million by us and\nwas subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and\nplaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the\ndistrict court denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice. On July 22, 2020, the parties executed an amended\nsettlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $ 650million by us. On August 19, 2020,\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. The\nsettlement amount is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet\nas of December 31, 2020.\nBeginning on September 28, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the\nUnited States and elsewhere against us alleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action\nin connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user\naccess tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified\ndamages and injunctive relief. The actions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district court certified a class for injunctive\nrelief purposes but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the\nparties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted\npreliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. We believe the remaining\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-\nattack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries.\nFrom time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data\nProtection Regulation, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and\ninvestigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. Although we are vigorously defending our\nregulatory compliance, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate potential loss related to the\ninquiries and investigations by the IDPC could be material in the aggregate.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and\nother regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of\nour legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user\ninformation in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and\npenalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against\nassociated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\n104\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, from time to time we are subject to\nvarious litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in\nthe United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among\nother things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital\nadvertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were\ninformed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC\nfiled a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in\nanticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission\nAct and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining\nconditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of\nantitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the\nattorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us\nin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in\nviolation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining\nconditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by\nacquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction\nagainst our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture\nor reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and\nfederal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in\nconnection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted\nlegal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments\non a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these\nother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these\nother matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15—Income Taxes.\n105\nTable of Contents\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2020, there was not at least a reasonable\npossibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded\nany liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2020.\nNote 13.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31,\n2020, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote,\nwhile the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock\nare convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares\nof our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common\nstock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 2,406million shares of Class A common stock and 443million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $ 4.90billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2020, an additional $ 10.00billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for $ 6.30billion. As of December 31, 2020, $ 8.60billion remained available and authorized for\nrepurchases. In January 2021, an additional $ 25billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nIn 2020, we maintained oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was\namended in each of June 2016 and February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance\nof incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance\nshares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection\nwith the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012\nPlan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\n106\nTable of Contents\nShare-based compensation expense mostly consists of the Company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs\ngranted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service\nperiod of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 129million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance\nunder our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number\nof shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term\nof the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock\nequal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the\nimmediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to\nthis automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 16million shares reserved for\nissuance effective January 1, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair\n(in thousands)                                  Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2019              78,851    $                            165.74\nGranted                                    62,032    $                            188.73\nVested                                    -38,857    $                            162.27\nForfeited                                  -5,293    $                            165.72\nUnvested at December 31, 2020              96,733    $                            181.88\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2019, and 2018 was $ 9.38billion, $ 6.01billion, and $ 7.57billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $ 16.50billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSUs\nawards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\napproximately three yearsbased on vesting under the award service conditions.\nNote 14.\nInterest

We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 424million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 2.65billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization.

The amount of interest and penalties accrued\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 774million and $ 747million, respectively.\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 8.69billion as of December 31, 2020 were realized in a\nfuture period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 4.85billion within our provision of income taxes at such\ntime.\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v.\nCommissioner , which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share\nexpenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion ( Altera Ninth\nCircuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a\ncumulative income tax expense of $ 1.11billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer\nrequested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer\nrequested a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020.\nSince we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation cost-sharing expense in the second quarter of\n2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in\n2020.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2016 and 2018 tax years and by the Irish tax\nauthorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by\nthe IRS. Our 2019 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not\nagree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January\n15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial began in\nFebruary 2020 and a second session is expected to continue in 2021. It is not clear how the IRS intends to apply\nthe revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in\nits updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of\nup to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and\nany penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes , that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in\nthe two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings\ncontinue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized\n110\nTable of Contents\ntax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax,\ninterest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flows.\nNote 16.\nGeographical Information\nThe following table sets forth our long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment,\nnet and operating lease right-of-use assets, net (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nLong-lived assets:                    2020         2019\nUnited States              $        43,128    $  35,858\nRest of the world(1)                11,853        8,925\nTotal long-lived assets    $        54,981    $  44,783\n_________________________\n(1) No individual country, other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total long-lived assets for any period\npresented.\n111\nTable of Contents"

Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2020 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs."

                "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our\nproducts, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nWe build technology that helps people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers,\nvirtual reality (VR) headsets, wearables, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and learn about what is\ngoing on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other\nactivities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay\nconnected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like\naugmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social\ntechnology.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). For FoA, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Ads on our platforms enable\nmarketers to reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors.\nMarketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-\nparty applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software and\ncontent. Our products include:\nFamily of Apps\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through News Feed, Stories, Groups,\nWatch, Marketplace, Reels, Dating, and more.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nVideo, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can express themselves and push culture\nforward through photos, video, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ngroups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, audio and video calls, and Rooms.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\nReality Labs\nReality Labs. Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nMeta Quest lets people defy distance with cutting-edge VR hardware, software, and content. Facebook Portal video\ncalling devices help friends and families stay connected and share the moments that matter in meaningful ways.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover\ncontent and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for\nexample, Alphabet (Google and YouTube),\n7\nTable of Contents\nAmazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to\nattract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid\nbusiness and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer\nhardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our\nexisting products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts\nto develop the metaverse, we may become subject to additional competition.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and VR increases,\nand as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to\nexpand. We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to\ndevelop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security,\nprivacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against\nabuse.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate in more than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also\ninvest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising,\nmarketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data\ndisclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of\nminors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or\nother trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance,\nand online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy\nand protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and\nother laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more\nrestrictive than those in the United States.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example,\nregulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent\nto various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely\naffect our financial results. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove\nor restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications\nDecency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business\npractices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nthe Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been\nsubjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the\nIrish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs\nin respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and\npreliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022.\nIf a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely\nupon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer\na number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business. For example, the GDPR includes operational\nrequirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are\ndifferent from those previously in place in the European Union, requires submission of personal data breach\nnotifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-\ncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a\nrelatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are\nsubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead\nto significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement\nof the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection\nregulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, and its\nsuccessor, the California Privacy Rights Act, which will take effect in January 2023, also establish certain\ntransparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European\nUnion's ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of\nthese or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of\nlegislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as\nother jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example,\nthe proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the\nUnited States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could potentially\nimpose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data\nacross services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are\nconsidering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and\nprocessing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nNew legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may\nalso result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in\ncertain jurisdictions.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil\nrights, content moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also\ncurrently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified\nconsent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and,\namong other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or\nenforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs,\nexpose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies),\ninterrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in\nnegative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our\nbusiness, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we believe\nthat people are at the heart of every connection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas,\ninnovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across engineering, product design, marketing,\nand other areas to further our mission.\nWe had a global workforce of 71,970 employees as of December 31, 2021, which represents a 23% year-over-year\nincrease in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as\nwe continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a\nnumber of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review\ninitiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth.\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe.\nThe vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the\nlong term, we expect some personnel to continue to transition to working remotely on a regular basis. We offer most\nof our full-time employees the option to work remotely on a regular basis.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are core to our work at Meta. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace\nwhere we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for\nthe global community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do.\nAs part of our diversity and inclusion report, we publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity\nworkforce data annually. As of June 30, 2021, our global employee base was comprised of 36.7% females and 63.3%\nmales, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 45.7% Asian, 39.1% White, 6.5%\nHispanic, 4.4% Black, 3.9% two or more ethnicities, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska\nNative and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In recent years, we also announced our goals to have 50% of\nour workforce made up of underrepresented groups by 2024, and to increase the representation of people of color in\nleadership positions in the United States, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also\ncontinue our ongoing efforts to increase the representation of women in leadership.\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and\ninclusion. We employ our Diverse Slate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and\nhiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We\nhave seen steady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this\napproach in 2015. We also continue to develop inclusive internship programs, and Meta University, our training\nprogram for college freshmen and sophomores with an interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and\ninclusive approach to promote participation by people from underrepresented groups. To help build community among\nour people and support their professional development, we invest in our internal Meta Resource Groups and our\nannual Community events such as Women's\n10\nTable of Contents\nCommunity Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community Summit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer\nManaging Unconscious Bias, Managing Inclusion, Be the Ally, and other trainings to promote an inclusive workplace\nby helping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of\nbias in the workplace.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2021, we announced\nthat our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and race in the United\nStates for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones with resources\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and\ntime away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits, family care resources, retirement\nsavings plans, access to tax and legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, family leave, and\npaid time off.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\nour ability to compete effectively;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nvolatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our\nfinancial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding,\nretaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and\nInstagram. We anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time as the size\nof our active user base increases. In addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,\nfluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time,\nparticularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have\nreduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business and\nmacroeconomic conditions. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases\nin the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore recently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside. We are unable to predict the impact of the\npandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and these trends may continue to be subject to\nvolatility. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the\ntotal number of DAUs on Facebook, as well as a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs\non Facebook in the United States & Canada region. Any future declines in the size of our active user base may\nadversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different products and services. Any\nnumber of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency,\n13\nTable of Contents\nprominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that\nintegrate with our products;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we\nrely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-\nfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the\ngeneral public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board\nregarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a\nresult of actions by us, third parties, or otherwise;\n14\nTable of Contents\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries;\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making\nit easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As our active user growth rate continues to slow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability\nto maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram.\nAs is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our\nmarketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not\ncontinue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not\ndeliver ads in an effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will\ngenerate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We\nhave implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes\nreduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to\nadversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on\ninvestment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial\nresults may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\n15\nTable of Contents\nadverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising,\nincluding developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize,\nsuch as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or\nmessaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our\nreliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates is invalid;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\nmobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third\nparties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or\npotential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a\nnumber of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on\nour products);\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads,\nincluding as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations,\nregulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have\naffected, and may in the future affect, marketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we experienced in\n2020 with the regional and worldwide economic\n16\nTable of Contents\ndisruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The\neffects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads, a related decline in pricing of our ads,\nand additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services, and any\nsimilar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads\nshown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user\nactivity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party\nmobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact,\nthe availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver\nrelevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools\nthat incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our\nbusiness. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA,\nhave impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In\nparticular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe\nfollowing adoption of the GDPR, which will increase further with expanded control over certain third-party data as\npart of our ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for\ncertain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation in\nthese or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further\nreduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple\nand Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and\napplication developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021,\nApple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating\nsystem that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit\nto us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product\nchanges that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on\nour products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product\nchanges we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have limited our ability to target and\nmeasure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our\nadvertising revenue in the second half of 2021 was negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and\nmeasurement challenges associated with iOS changes. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take\nfurther effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected,\nwhich would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or\neliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products,\nlimit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the\ndistribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of our products and\nmonetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits\nthe use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts\nmonetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We\nexpect that any similar changes to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our\nability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver\nhigh quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies,\nproducts, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with\nthese technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is\n17\nTable of Contents\nmore difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to\naccess or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products,\nour user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the\ndistribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best\ninterests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating\nsystems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and\nthere is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our\nusers are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user\ngrowth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have in the\npast experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and\nstandards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth,\nengagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer\nhardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may\nnot be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new\nproducts, or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also\ninvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to\nsupport increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and\nwe may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long\nterm. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging\nservices, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or enhanced products fail to engage\nusers, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users\nor to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business\nmay be adversely affected.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking\nalgorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial\nresults. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our\nproduct and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to\nour products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and\ncould reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or\nother changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties,\nformats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as\nwe focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have\nreduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products\nor services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue\nto promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. These\ndecisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits\nthat we expect.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product\nstrategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-\nterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in\nprivacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other\nparticipants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of\nfeatures, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. In addition, we have limited experience\nwith consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other companies to\ncompete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including\nif we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate\neffectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also\ndivert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make\nsignificant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our\nability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In\naddition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations\nin the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy and e-commerce, which may\ndelay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant\nmanagement time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse\nstrategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect\nour business, reputation, or financial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of\nour new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our\nability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if\nusers do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products\nor interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media,\nlegislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption,\ncontent, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in\nconnection with elections or the COVID-19 pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future\nadversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of\nmedia, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal\ncompany documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content\nenforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-\nbeing. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer\nthat shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond\nexpeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices\nby advertisers or developers, or to otherwise enforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in\nthe past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions\nof users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false\nor inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be\nmisleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to\nuser information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our\nproducts or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the\npandemic or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content\non our platform from the independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or\nactual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend\nparticipation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and\nenhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful.\nCertain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our\nhandling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues,\nhave eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we\n19\nTable of Contents\nfail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business\nand financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web\napplications that integrate with Facebook and our other products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and\nweb applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may\nnot be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or web applications that create and maintain user\nengagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled\nby third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are\ncontinuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal\nuser experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such\ndevelopers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these\ndevelopers to users on Facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and\nsuch actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile\nand web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety,\nand security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these\nactions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or\nwill adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or\ngrow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or\nif we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our\nadvertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to\ncontain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business\nactivity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause,\nbusiness slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions, which have previously significantly\nimpacted our business and results of operations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising\nrevenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public\noffering. While our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent quarters, there can be no assurance that\nit will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic. In addition, we believe that the pandemic\npreviously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, which in turn increased demand for our\nadvertising services. More recently, we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, and we may experience\nreduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues,\nwhich could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our advertising services\nmay be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict\nthe duration or degree of such impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business,\nthe pandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as\na result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising\npractices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or\nobjectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\n20\nTable of Contents\nadverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of\nlimitations on our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as\nthe necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to\nperform;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nnegative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to\ndifficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us. The persistence of COVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread\nof the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operate our business and may materially\nand adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share,\ncommunicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective\naudiences, including, for example, Alphabet (Google and YouTube), Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft,\nSnap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our\nproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to\nattract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We\nalso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products\nand services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies\nintroduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we may become subject\nto additional competition.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly\nengage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics\nor more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our\nproducts more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating\ncompeting platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\nsearch engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated\ncompetitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit\nour ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and\n21\nTable of Contents\nmeasure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or\ngenerate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business\nand financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but\nwe cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate\nwith Facebook and our other products;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other\nproducts;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\n22\nTable of Contents\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our\nprivacy practices, advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity,\ngovernment surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are\nintegrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance\nor enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the\nquality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or\nservices on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the\npast, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of\nsignificant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech,\nand other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to\nthese topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of\nallegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may\nin the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit\nor objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and elections\nin the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size,\nengagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in\ndecreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse\neffects to varying degrees from time to time.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result\nof the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\n23\nTable of Contents\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of\ntime;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\nactions;\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, and\ncontent, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of\ndiscrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\n24\nTable of Contents\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity\ninvestments, and in interest rates;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\nOur rates of growth may be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect they will\ndecline over time in the future.\nWe have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, volatility in our user and revenue growth rates\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility\nwith any certainty. In the long term, we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the\nsize of our active user base increases, and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or\nmore markets, particularly as we achieve greater market penetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will\ncontinue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates experience volatility\nor decline, investors' perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock could decline.\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and\naugmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for\nexample with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and\npromote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and\nunproven technologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding\noperations, including our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time\nto time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and\nregulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in\nnew platforms and technologies, including as we continue our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of\nthese investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only\nlimited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of\nsuch investments to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our\n2021 overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and we expect our investments to increase in future\nperiods. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, in 2021, the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority issued an order directing us to divest our Giphy acquisition, which we have appealed. In some\ncases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance\nthat we will realize expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities for our\nacquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result\nin increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other\nrestrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our\nexpenses, adversely affect our financial results, and\n25\nTable of Contents\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce\ncould be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business\nor the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our\nacquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing\noperating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We\ncannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we\nacquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our service, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a\npotential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not\nbe adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays\nor outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access\nthem, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at\nall, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial\nperformance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a\ncombination of an error and a bug resulted in an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the\namount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our\nglobal community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an\nincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical\ninfrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures\nresulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism,\ngeopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate\nchange could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.\nAny such events may result in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to\nrecover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may\nadversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy or\nother costs to maintain the availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events.\nIn 2020, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our\ntechnical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate any such demands in the future, including as a result\nof our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the\nservices\n26\nTable of Contents\nwe receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could\nsignificantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with\nthe services they provide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue\nto experience, supply and labor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical\ninfrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices, and in the future we\nmay not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs,\nor we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\nemerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges,\namong others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects,\nincluding due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of\ncomponents, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges\nor actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead to increased\nproject costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or\nreliability of our products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related\nto this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may\nonly become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the\nuser experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United\nStates, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to such government action, could\nresult in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade\nthe quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of\nthese events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP))\nand Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data\nbased on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition,\nwe are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to\nimprovements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and\nfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can\nresult in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted\nby data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We\ngenerally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that\nare within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger,\n27\nTable of Contents\nand WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products\nin our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual\npeople. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that\nseek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an\nindividual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are\nsubject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and\nuncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which\nitself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to\nperiod, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is\nvery difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is\npossible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may\nindicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our\nFamily metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of\ncalculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics,\nwhether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other\nfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report\nthese metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including\nthrough the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user\nsurveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our\nproducts or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to\nidentify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include\nsuch person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not\nconstitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP\nestimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting\nsolely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts\n28\nTable of Contents\nare based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this\ndetermination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and\nsimilar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that\nappears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a\nresult of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative\nrequirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also\nmay impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may\nchange as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or\nproduct changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our\nability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure\nat our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from\nour estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain\nuser accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our\nestimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer,\nregulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers,\nor investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in\nour metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and\ndevelopers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions,\nwhich could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number\nof employees increasing to 71,970 as of December 31, 2021 from 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, and we expect\nheadcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of\nemployees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives\nas well as other functions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products\ncreate significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple\nrelationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number of our\nthird-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and\nprocedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of our management do not have\nsignificant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not\n29\nTable of Contents\nbe able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working\nremotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may\nnegatively impact productivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges to productivity and\ncollaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience\ndifficulties integrating recently hired personnel when our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we\nmust continue to adapt to a remote work environment; improve our operational, financial, and management processes\nand systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we\nare required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult\nto maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and\ninnovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have\nmore limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that\ncould affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international\nmarkets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are\ngenerally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain\nmarkets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available\nin China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy,\nmanage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject\nto a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n30\nTable of Contents\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in\nlogistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product\ndevelopment, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse\nchanges in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and\nsale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs,\nor supply chain disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment,\nand business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws,\nfails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as\nunethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines,\ncanceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and\nother factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components\nare ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in\naccurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they\nmay not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely\n31\nTable of Contents\naffect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the\npast, and may in the future, be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising,\nantitrust, privacy, biometrics, content, algorithms, employment, activities on our platform, consumer protection,\nor product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual\nreality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple\nputative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data\nby a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of\nour earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other\nalleged anticompetitive conduct; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents\nbeginning in September 2021. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and\nany negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or\nundesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\n32\nTable of Contents\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework\nunder which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than\n140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.\nAs this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and\nultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and\nseveral countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under\nwhich we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For\nexample, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include\nbusiness activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax\nrate. For example, in 2021, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision\nfor income taxes by $1.13 billion and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate\nwithout such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based\ncompensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of\nshare-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do\nnot control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely\naffect our financial results.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill\n33\nTable of Contents\nor intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and\nSheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the\nagreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies\nand systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of\nmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our\noperations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to\nmaintain our competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical\npersonnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such\npersonnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other\nfactors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity\nawards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to\nattract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based\ncompensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to\nattract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition,\nrestrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect\nour efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel . If we do not succeed in\nattracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be\nunable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or\nsale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change\nof control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders\nsupport, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our\nother stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from\nacquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might\nharm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the\nmanagement and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to\ncontrol the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of\nour capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated.\nAs a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith\nin a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a\ncontrolling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control\nas governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will\nenhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase\nvolatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of\nour stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that\nprovides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user\nservices, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In\naddition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong\nKong as a result of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising,\nincluding in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we\ngenerate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is\npossible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising\nrevenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or\ninformation requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as\nimposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found\nto be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish\ngovernment could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely\nimpact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to\ncensorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to\nor elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors\nare able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets\nthat we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user\nengagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or\ngrow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of\nthese laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\nto our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user\ngrowth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights\nof publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention\nand deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and\nother communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications,\nproduct liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and\npolitical law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products,\nexpansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to\nadditional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content,\ncompetition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more\nrestrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example,\nregulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent\nto various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in\nwhich we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs will be the subject of future regulatory\nconsideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not\nachieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European\nUnion to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of\nthis IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. In May 2021, the court\nrejected Meta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges and the inquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a\nfinal decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. If a new transatlantic data transfer\nframework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data\ntransfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant\nproducts and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we have been managing investigations and\nlawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service\nand privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and services, including a lawsuit\ncurrently pending before the Supreme Court of India, and also became subject to government inquiries and lawsuits\nregarding the 2021 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy. If we are unable to transfer data\nbetween and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our\nproducts and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our\nservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented\na number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant\npenalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The\nGDPR is still a relatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by\nthe IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism,\nwhich may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation\nand enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to\nsignificant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data\nprotection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in\ntheir respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, and\nits successor, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will take effect in January 2023, also establish\ncertain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of\ncertain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control how their data is shared with third\nparties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will\ncontinue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, regulators continue to issue guidance\nconcerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. In\naddition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly,\nthere are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our\nbusiness. For example, the proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify\ncompetition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs\nand could potentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as\nthe combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries,\nsuch as India, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring\nlocal storage and processing of data or similar\n36\nTable of Contents\nrequirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory\ndecisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on\nour advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased\ncompliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational\nharm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business,\nincluding fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and\nexpand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or\nconsent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European\nUnion and other jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict\nthe ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In\naddition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data\npractices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to\nresolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other\nmatters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our\npractices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain\ngovernment inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. Beginning in September 2018, we also became subject to\nIDPC and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in\nFacebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook.\nWe also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data\nbreaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European\nregulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance.\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our\nbusiness, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations,\nand lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition,\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we also became subject to lawsuits\nby the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things.\nThe complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged\nviolations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram\nand WhatsApp. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business\nactivities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government\ninvestigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former\nemployee.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties\n(including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner\nmaterially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of\n37\nTable of Contents\nthese adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and\nlegislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business\npractices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and\nfinancial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the\nworld, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy\nprogram in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors\noversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making\nmisrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to\nthe FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and\nwill continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are\nincreasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including\ninvestments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources\ninternally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our\nother business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices\nand make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a\nresult, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has\nbeen and will continue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts\nwill require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC\nconsent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and\nfrom time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these\nrequirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in\nthe future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject\nto significant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the\nmandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other regulatory or legislative requirements,\nor if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to\nregulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments,\nor other penalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these\nevents could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such\ninformation or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation,\ndissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of\npublicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety,\nconsumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside\nthe United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be\nless protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union\npassed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright\ninfringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing\ninto their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive\nto apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United\nStates, there have been, and continue to be, various legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the\nscope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well\nas to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods\nand copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United\nStates could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\nwe are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in\nparticular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For\nexample, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the imposition\nof fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and\ndisclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are\nconsidering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines,\n38\nTable of Contents\nservice throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain\nprocesses. For example, we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in\nconnection with social media legislation in Russia and Turkey. Content-related legislation also has required us in\nthe past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our costs, or\notherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or\nto implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial\ninvestments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may also\nrequire online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our compliance costs may significantly increase as a\nresult of the Digital Services Act proposed in the European Union, which is expected to take effect in 2023, and\nother content-related legislative developments such as online safety bills in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In\nthe United States, changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act or new state or federal content-related\nlegislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or\noperations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely\naffect our business and financial results.\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase virtual and digital\ngoods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and\nmake donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and\nregulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and\ncounter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments,\nelectronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and\nimport and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws\nand regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or\ninterpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may\nevolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain payments licenses in the United States, the\nEuropean Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with\nmany domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be\ncostly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event\nthat we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary\nfines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans\nto develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and\nadditional licensing requirements.\nOur digital payments initiatives subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe are pursuing digital payments initiatives, such as Novi, a digital wallet that we expect to offer as both a\nstandalone application and subsequently integrated in other Meta products. These initiatives may use blockchain-\nbased assets, such as the USDP stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is being used in a Novi pilot\nprogram in the United States and Guatemala beginning in October 2021. Our future initiatives to support commerce in\nthe metaverse also may use blockchain-based assets in digital payments. Use of blockchain-based assets in payments\nare a relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and\nevolving. These digital payments efforts have drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in\nmultiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. We are participating in responses to inquiries from\ngovernments and regulators related to our digital payments initiatives, and adverse government or regulatory\nactions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our\nbusiness.\nAs our digital payments initiatives evolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United\nStates and international jurisdictions, including those governing payments, financial services, virtual currency,\nanti-money\n39\nTable of Contents\nlaundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions, data protection, tax, consumer protection, and\ncompetition. In many jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear,\nparticularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. In\naddition, Novi has also received state money transmitter licenses in the United States, with more pending approval,\nand has other financial services license applications pending in certain other countries that would allow us to\nconduct digital wallet activities in those countries. These licenses, laws, and regulations, as well as any\nassociated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the development of digital payments products and\nservices we offer, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise\nharm our business.\nIn addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As\nsuch, there can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer will be made available in a\ntimely manner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based technology, which may\nadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market such digital payments products and services. We\nwill also incur increased costs in connection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of\nthese events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general\nhacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our\nsystems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase\nads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other\nobjectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data\nand content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving\nnew and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and\nattacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors.\nOur efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such\nbreaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users\nor marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm\nto us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities\non our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee,\ncontractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information\ntechnology systems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or\ntechnical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently\ninduce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-\nattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to\nprevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect\nsecurity breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to\nreact in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. The changes in our work environment\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to\nprotect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur\n40\nTable of Contents\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur\nsignificant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business\npractices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify\nadditional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy,\nsafety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of\nthese efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce,\nadditional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all\nsuch incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of\nvisibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel\nworking remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and\nwe may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and\nmay in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts\nor policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising\npractices, activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data\nharvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce\nour policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include\nnegative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices\nin a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Any such\ndevelopments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to\nmonetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and\ninternal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage\nimmense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain,\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise\nour ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and\nmay only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September\n2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely, or\nhuman error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a\nnegative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in\na manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements,\ntargeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our\nintellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For\nexample, we make\n41\nTable of Contents\ncommitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products, and our systems are\nsubject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably.\nIn addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we\nrely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations\nor interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may\nin the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of\nrevenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we\ndeveloped available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of\nour open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these\nevents could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights\nclaims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other\nintellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products\nand services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number\nof intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we\nexpect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other\nintellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and\nthere can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may\nseek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation,\nincluding potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to\nsettle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are\na party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal.\nThe terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\nviolation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop\nalternative non-infringing technology or\n42\nTable of Contents\npractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could\nrequire significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise\nnegatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such\ndisputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2021. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation\n43\nTable of Contents\nin connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared\nsuch data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the\nsecond quarter of 2018; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in\nSeptember 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities\nlitigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our\nbusiness, and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do\nnot expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a\nreturn on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders\nwho hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and\ntheir affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nBecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B\ncommon stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are\nable to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common\nstock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated\ncontrol will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our\n44\nTable of Contents\ncompany requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n45\nTable of Contents"

Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion\nand to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys\ngeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of\nEuropean user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user\ndata from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged\nprocedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020.\nOn May 14, 2021, the court rejected Meta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges, and the inquiry subsequently\nrecommenced. We believe a final decision in this\n46\nTable of Contents\ninquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy,\ndata use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\"\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and\ncosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our\nbusiness, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal,\nby competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries,\nand lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and\nby maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became\nthe subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December\n9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in\nanticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and\nWhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we\nviolated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys\ngeneral both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and\nother equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the\ncourt granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's\ncomplaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the\nattorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an\namended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11,\n2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also\nbeen filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and\nother causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking\ndamages and unspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users\nwere consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the\ncourt granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or\ninquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other\nstructural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being . Beginning on October 27, 2021,\nmultiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional\nlegal proceedings and disputes."

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2021 using 2020 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2021 Results\nOur key community metrics and financial results for 2021 are as follows:\nFamily of Apps metrics:\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.82 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 8% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.93 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 5% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.91 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year in 2021, and the average price\nper ad increased by 24% year-over-year in 2021.\n50\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated and segment results:\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family\nof Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

All of our\nproducts, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to\nconnect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to\ninvest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing\nthe internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully\nimprove people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our\nbusiness by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv)\ncommunicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.\nOur advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a\nresult of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system.\nWe expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by these and other\nlimitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers.\nOur business and results of operations have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative\nmeasures implemented by authorities from time to time to help limit the spread of the illness, which have caused,\nand are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. Beginning\nin the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user\nbase across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen these pandemic-\nrelated trends subside, particularly in certain developed markets. We are unable to predict the impact of the\npandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trends may continue to be subject to\nvolatility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also had a varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period.\nWhile we experienced a reduction in demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we\nbelieve the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, particularly\nduring the second half of 2020, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend.\nMore recently, we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, which to some extent adversely affected our\nadvertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021. We may experience reduced advertising demand and related\ndeclines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues, which could adversely affect our\nadvertising revenue growth. However, the impact of the\n51\nTable of Contents\npandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our advertising services, as well as on our\noverall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nUser growth and engagement were also impacted by a number of other factors in the second half of 2021. For example,\ncompetitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, and in\nresponse to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels, which is growing in usage but is\nnot currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also saw a deceleration in our\ncommunity growth rates as the size of our community continued to increase. In addition, we experienced year-over-\nyear declines in ad impressions delivered in the United States & Canada region. These trends adversely affected\nadvertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue\ngrowth in the foreseeable future. Other global and regional business and macroeconomic conditions also have had,\nand we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth.\nWe anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office\nfacilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, including in our Reality Labs initiatives, will\ncontinue to drive expense growth in 2022. We expect 2022 capit al expenditures to be in the range of $29-34 billion\nand total expenses to be in the range of $90-95 billion. In 2022, we also expect that our year-over-year total\nexpense growth rates may significantly exceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect\nour operating margin and profitability.\n52\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our\nexpenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below)\naccess our Family products on mobile devices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDAP/MAP:    78%    79%    79%    79%    79%    79%    79%    78%    79%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020. In the first\nquarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent\nuser survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million DAP to our\nreported worldwide DAP in March 2021.\nWorldwide DAP increased 8% to 2.82 billion on average during December 2021 from 2.60 billion during December 2020.\n53\nTable of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020. In the first\nquarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent\nuser survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million MAP to our\nreported worldwide MAP in March 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 3.59 billion MAP, an increase of 9% from 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $7.38    $6.03    $6.10    $6.76    $8.62    $7.75    $8.36    $8.18    $9.39\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $33.68, an\nincrease of 22% from 2020.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and\ncapital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on\nmobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\nDAU/MAU:    66%    67%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%\n…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    D…    7…    …    7…    …    7…    …    7…    …    7…\n…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    D…    6…    …    6…    …    6…    …    6…    …    6…\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 5% to 1.93 billion on aver age during December 2021 from 1.84 billion during December\n2020. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December\n2021, relative to the same period in 2020.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 2.91 billion MAUs, an increase of 4% from December 31, 2020. Users in India,\nVietnam, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.\n57\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nWhile the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate\nthat revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total\nrevenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our\nFamily products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize\nusers in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &\nCanada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile\nadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2021 in the United States & Canada region was more than 12 times higher\nthan in the Asia-Pacific region.\nARPU:    $8.52    $6.95    $7.05    $7.89    $10.14    $9.27    $10.12    $10.00    $11.57\n$      $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $      …        …        …        …        $      $\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $40.96, an\nincrease of 28% from 2020. For 2021, ARPU increased by 40% in Rest of World, 35% in Europe, 31% in the United\nStates & Canada, and 26% in Asia‑Pacific, as compared with 2020. In addition, user growth was more rapid in\ngeographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the\nfuture will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may\ncontinue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if\nARPU increases in each geographic region.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the\nlevels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such\nmatters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is\nmaterial. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when\napplicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider\nthese to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating\nwhether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis.\nIn this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred\nto the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory\nrisk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent\nin a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.\nValuation of Equity Investments\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative,\ndetermining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may\nrequire judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as\nvoting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable\nprice for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal\nor most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely\nreporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the\ntransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a\nperiod subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative\nassessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook;\nindustry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash\nflows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we\nestimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and\nrecognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the\ncarrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash\nflows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate\n60\nTable of Contents\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development\ntax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our\nactivities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for\nour uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with\nthe income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the\nrefinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is\nmade, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 — Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated\nUseful Lives\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to\nmake significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in\nvaluing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected\ncash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant\nperspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based\n61\nTable of Contents\nupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,\nactual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and\nliabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the\nuseful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the\nmeasurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We\nhave two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill\nhas been identified.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from\nthe use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not\nrecorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining\nestimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts\nand circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as\nchanges to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted\nfor prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of our server and network assets category. The effect of the 2021 change was a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per\ndiluted share. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of\nthe effective dates of the changes and applying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional\ninformation regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment.\n62\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile\napplications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. We calculate price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered,\nrepresenting the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as\nimpression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on\na net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and\nrevenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest , Facebook Portal, and\nwearables, and related software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution\nof our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related\nexpenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and\ncontent costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which\ninclude share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who\nare responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, and professional services.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses and\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales\nsupport, marketing, business development, and customer service functions.

The increase was mostly driven by an\nincrease in advertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2021 increased $30.76 billion, or 37%, compared to 2020 as a result of increases in both the\naverage price per ad and the number of ads delivered. In 2021, the average price per ad increased by 24%, as\ncompared with a decrease of approximately 10% in 2020. The increase in average price per ad in 2021 was mainly\ncaused by a recovery from declines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020, due to the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, overall advertising demand increased, as compared to 2020, across our ad products\nand in all regions in part due to the continued growth of online commerce. In 2021, the number of ads delivered\nincreased by 10%, as compared with an approximate 34% increase in 2020. The increase in the ads delivered in 2021\nwas driven by increases in users and the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. We anticipate\nthat future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.\n65\nTable of Contents\nReality Labs\nRL revenue increased $1.14 billion, or 100%, from 2020 to 2021, and $638 million, or 127%, from 2019 to 2020. The\nincreases in both periods were mostly driven by increases in the volume of our consumer hardware products sold.\nRevenue Seasonality and Customer Concentration\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 31%, and\n19% between the third and fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019 declined 7%, 16%, and 11% compared to the fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nrespectively. We note the decline in total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was exacerbated by the non-seasonal\nimpact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nThe general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2021 compared to\nthe same period in 2020 had a favorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2021\nusing the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar,\nour total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $116.29 billion and $113.31 billion, respectively. Using\nthese constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.64 billion and $1.62 billion lower\nthan actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2021. Using the same constant\nrates, full year 2021 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $30.32 billion and $29.15 billion,\nrespectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                             2021 vs 2020       2020 vs 2019\n2021              2020              2019             % Change       % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nCost of        $        22,649         $  16,692         $  12,770                   36  %                  31%\nrevenue\nPercentage                      19%               19%               18%\nof revenue\nCost of revenue in 2021 increased $5.96 billion, or 36%, compared to 2020. The majority of the increase was due to\nan increase in Reality Labs cost of products sold and an increase in operational expenses related to our data\ncenters and technical infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciation growth rate mostly due to\nincreases in the useful lives of servers and network assets. To a lesser extent, costs associated with partner\narrangements, including traffic acquisition and payment processing costs, also increased.\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the\nestimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.\nIn 2022, we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and\ntechnical infrastructure to support user growth and engagement and the delivery of new products and services, and,\nto a lesser extent, due to higher content costs.\n66\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                              2021 vs 2020       2020 vs 2019\n2021              2020              2019              % Change           % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nResearch and    $        24,655         $  18,447         $  13,600                    34  %              36  %\ndevelopment\nPercentage                       21%               21%               19%\nof revenue\nResearch and development expenses in 2021 increased $6.21 billion, or 34%, compared to 2020.

The majority of the increases in loss from operations in both periods were\ndriven by increases in payroll and related expenses primarily due to the growth in RL research and development\nheadcount and higher gross losses from increases in volume of consumer hardware sales.\nInterest and other income, net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                             2021 vs 2020 %          2020 vs 2019 %\n2021       2020       2019               Change                  Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nInterest income,    $                461    $   672    $   904                  -31  %                  -26  %\nnet\nForeign currency\nexchange losses,                    -140       -129       -105                   -9  %                  -23  %\nnet\nOther income                         210        -34         27                       NM                      NM\n(expense), net\nInterest and\nother income,       $                531    $   509    $   826                    4  %                  -38  %\nnet\nInterest and other income, net in 2021 increased $22 million, or 4%, compared to 2020.

As a result, we recorded a total\nof $1.07 billion income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from\nacquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of\nchanges in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 28,\n2022 price, and absent U.S. tax legislation changes and other one-time events, we expect our effective tax rate for\nthe full year 2022 to be similar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021. This includes the effects of the\nmandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022, as required by the\n2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities\nbut also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the\nmandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points\nhigher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions\nthat have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and\nour effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of\nthis impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well\nas the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\nSee Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\n69\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated\nfrom operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks,\ninvestments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities,\nand investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $48.0\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $13.96 billion from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily\ndue to $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $19.24 billion for capital expenditures,\nincluding principal payments on finance leases, and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of\nemployee restricted stock units (RSU) awards, offset by $57.68 billion of cash generated from operations for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\nCash paid for income taxes was $8.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our\nfederal net operating loss carryforward was $10.61 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $527\nmillion. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within\nthe next two years.\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 136 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billion remained available\nand authorized for repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $10.61 billion of the $48.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\nwas held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign\nearnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign\njurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our\noperational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the\nforeseeable future.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   57,683    $   38,747    $   36,314\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                   -7,570    $  -30,059    $  -19,864\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -50,728    $  -10,292    $   -7,299\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $39.37 billion net income adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, including $9.16 billion of share-based compensation expense and $7.97 billion of\ndepreciation and amortization. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was\nprimarily du e to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation\nexpense and deferred income taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily consisted of $18.57 billion of purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure offset\nby $12.18 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash used in investing\nactivities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of marketable securities and\nequity investments, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $29 billion to $34 billion in 2022.\n70\nTable of Contents\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in\nfinancing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to the increase in repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nNet cash provided by operating         $                   57,683    $   38,747    $   36,314\nactivities\nLess: Purchases of property and                           -18,567       -15,115       -15,102\nequipment\nLess: Principal payments on finance                          -677          -604          -552\nleases\nFree cash flow                         $                   38,439    $   23,028    $   20,660\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital\nexpenditures, or capital resources.\n71\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments.\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, colocations and\nland. Our other contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure\nand Reality Labs. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (in millions):\nPayment Due by Period\nTotal                        2022       2023-2024       2025-2026       Thereafter\nOperating lease\nobligations,             $  25,410    $                  1,559    $      3,966    $      3,837    $      16,048\nincluding\nimputed interest(1)\nFinance lease\nobligations,                 2,303                         678             603             322              700\nincluding\nimputed interest(1)\nTransition tax               1,537                           —             848             689                —\npayable\nOther contractual           23,080                      14,502           5,426             609            2,543\ncommitments\nTotal contractual        $  52,330    $                 16,739    $     10,843    $      5,457    $      19,291\nobligations\n_________________________\n(1) Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase\nrenewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components\nthat do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to\nsecure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated\nspend is approximately $8.06 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on\nprevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\nOur other liabilities also include $4.40 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021.\nDue to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions\nis uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years\nbeyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal\nProceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n72\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\ninvestment risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in\nthe future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency losses of $140 million, $129 million, and $105 million were recognized in 2021, 2020,\nand 2019, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and\ncash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits,\nmoney market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\ndebt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our\nliquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents\nand marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $714 million and $794 million in the market value of our\navailable-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Any realized gains\nor losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on\nthe carrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable fair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including recent and\nongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result\nin a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our total equity investments had a carrying value of\n$6.78 billion and $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nNote 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n73\nTable of Contents"

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n75\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nloss contingencies was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments\nof the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential\namount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence\nof a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses,\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the\nmeetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested\nand received internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss\nthe nature of the various matters, and obtained representations\nfrom management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the\nrelated disclosures included in Note 11 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n76\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 2, 2022\n77\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 2, 2022\n78\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, Inc.\nto Meta Platforms, Inc. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer\ntogether. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nW e report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) . The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. W e generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses\nof available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, credit losses of accounts receivable, fair value of financial\ninstruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations\nabout actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of selected cohorts of servers and network assets from three yearsto four yearsin\nprior years as well as in 2021 as a result of longer refresh cycles in our data centers. Prior year changes\nindividually or in aggregate did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The effect of\nthe 2021 changes was a reduction in depreciation expense of $ 620million and an increase in net income of $\n516million, or $ 0.18per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2021. The impact from the changes in our\nestimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and applying\nthe revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n85\nTable of Contents\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through\nagent.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\naffiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their\nrelationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party\npublishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements\nwhere we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook Portal, and\nwearables, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is\ntransferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nRL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from\nvarious other sources.\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\nDeferred revenue and deposits mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of\nrevenue recognition, revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various RL\nproducts. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make\npurchases in games on our platform. Once the unused balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount\nwould then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred\nrevenue and deposits balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by cash payments from customers in\nadvance of satisfying our performance obligations in RL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized\nthat was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is\nnot significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or\nservices are delivered to the customer.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded\nwithin marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\n86\nTable of Contents\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the\nright to invoice for services performed.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products.\nThese include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost\nof revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit\ncard and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted\nand available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria\nfor capitalization were not material to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended.\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\n87\nTable of Contents\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.99billion, $ 2.26billion, and $ 1.57billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90\ndays or less from the date of purchase.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-\nsale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current\noperations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of\ntaxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with\nan amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a\ncharge in interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized\nlosses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The\namounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not material. There was no\nimpairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable\nsecurities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income, net\non the consolidated statements of income.\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank\nprovider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on\nthe consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\nEquity Investments\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable fair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value from observable transactions\nfor identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change in\ncarrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If\n88\nTable of Contents\nindicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the\ninvestment to fair value.\nIn addition, we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing\nobservable market inputs.\nOur equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur,\nthe respective equity investment would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the\nvaluation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other\nunobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowances for accounts receivable\nwere immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at\ncost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\n89\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets\nare described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           Four years\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges\nduring the years presented.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations,\nchanges in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated\nor amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See section \"Use of Estimates\" above for additional\ninformation regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in\nprogress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\nservice for their intended use.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such\nsale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, land, colocations, network infrastructure, and\nother equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is\na lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease\ncomponents and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such\nas contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such\nvariable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and\nequipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\n90\nTable of Contents\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar\neconomic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration\nto identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets\nare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not\namortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related\nexpenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level\n91\nTable of Contents\nannually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As\nof December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not\nrecoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We\nhave not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2021, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of tax of $ 677million and as of December 31, 2020, we had a\ncumulative translation gain, net of tax of $ 439million.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income, net on our consolidated\nstatements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 140million, $ 129million, and\n$ 105million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents\nconsists of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable\nsecurities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and\ndiversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\nnot material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 41%, 42%, and 43% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021,\n2020, and 2019, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of\nrevenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada, Australia,\nBrazil, and Thailand.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n92\nTable of Contents\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic\n321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU\n2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting\nfor equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options\nin Topic 815. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible\nInstruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for convertible\ninstruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance\nalso eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and\nrequires the use of the if-converted method. The new standard was effective for us beginning January 1, 2022, with\nearly adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOn October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU No. 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases with Variable\nLease Payments (ASU 2016-02), which requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not\ndepend on an index or rate as an operating lease if specified criteria are met. The new standard was effective for\nus beginning January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets\nand Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a\nbusiness should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic\n606) . This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis, with early\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business\nEntities about Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance\nreceived by most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received;\n(2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial\nstatements. This guidance will be effective for us in the year ended December 31, 2022, with early adoption\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions).

As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we expect $ 517million of our deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year.\nNote 3.\nEarnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings\nare allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nFor the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities,\nincluding awards under our equity compensation plans.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the\nweighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nRSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years\nended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\n94\nTable of Contents\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2021                     2020                     2019\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,383         432        2,407         444        2,404         450\nearnings per share\nBasic EPS               $                   13.99    $  13.99    $   10.22    $  10.22    $    6.48    $   6.48\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            6,042           —        4,539           —        2,916           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —         -93            —         -58            —         -18\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  39,370    $  5,949    $  29,146    $  4,481    $  18,485    $  2,898\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,383         432        2,407         444        2,404         450\nearnings per share\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           432           —          444           —          450           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive                             44           —           37           —           22           1\nRSUs\nShares used in\ncomputation of                              2,859         432        2,888         444        2,876         451\ndiluted\nearnings per share\nDiluted EPS             $                   13.77    $  13.77    $   10.09    $  10.09    $    6.43    $   6.43\n95\nTable of Contents\nNote 4.

Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating\nentities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of\neach day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool,\nany overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nWe have $ 23.08billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2021, which are primarily\nrelated to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and Reality Labs. These commitments are primarily\ndue within five years.\n101\nTable of Contents\nLegal and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified\nconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of\nour directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders\nfiled an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary\nduty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and\nconsolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. The GDPR is still a relatively new law and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are\nsubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead\nto significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement\nof the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts\nfor loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material in the\naggregate.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. Beginning on October 27, 2021,\nmultiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\n102\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and\ngovernment inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our\nbusiness practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile\nor online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it\nhad opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair\nmethods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our\nplatform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by\nthe U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46\nstates, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the\nSherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access\nto our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram\nand WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our\ncompany's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or\nreconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints\nfiled by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the\nattorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the\norder dismissing their case. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we\nfiled a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the\nFTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the\nUnited States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these\nacquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief.\nSeveral of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in\npart, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are\nvigorously defending them.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted\nlegal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments\non a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these\nother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these\nother matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14 — Income Taxes.\n103\nTable of Contents\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2021, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability\nfor costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2021.\nNote 12.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31,\n2021, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote,\nwhile the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock\nare convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares\nof our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common\nstock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 2,328million shares of Class A common stock and 413million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, $ 8.60billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2021 and October 2021, additional $ 25.0billion and $\n50.0billion of repurchases were authorized under this program, respectively. In 2021, we repurchased and\nsubsequently retired 136million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 44.81billion. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, $ 38.79billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nSince 2020, we have maintained oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan,\nwhich was amended in each of June 2016, February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the\nissuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs,\nperformance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld\nin connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the\nAmended 2012 Plan.\n104\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 116million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance\nunder our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number\nof shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term\nof the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock\nequal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the\nimmediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to\nthis automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 20million shares of Class A\ncommon stock reserved for issuance effective January 1, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)                                    Per Share\nUnvested at December 31, 2020              96,733    $                                  181.88\nGranted                                    59,127    $                                  305.40\nVested                                    -44,574    $                                  198.95\nForfeited                                 -12,438    $                                  211.58\nUnvested at December 31, 2021              98,848    $                                  244.32\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n188.73and $ 173.66, respectively.

2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, primarily relating to U.S. state tax credit carryforwards and U.S. foreign tax credits for which we\ndo not believe a tax benefit is more likely than not to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were $ 10.61billion and $\n2.11billion, which will begin to expire in 2028 and 2027, respectively, if not utilized. We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 527million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 3.18billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock\nownership change of greater than 50% over a three‑yearperiod.\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021        2020        2019\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑           $                    8,692    $  7,863    $  4,678\nbeginning of period\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                328         356       2,309\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                -86        -253        -525\npositions\nIncreases related to current year tax                              963       1,045       1,402\npositions\nDecreases related to settlements of                                -90        -319          -1\nprior year tax positions\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of    $                    9,807    $  8,692    $  7,863\nperiod\nThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our\nforeign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions,\nas well as for\n107\nTable of Contents\nthe uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties\nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of\nincome. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 960million and $\n774million, respectively.\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 9.81billion as of December 31, 2021 were realized in a\nfuture period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 5.70billion within our provision of income taxes at such\ntime.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years and by the Irish tax\nauthorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by\nthe IRS. Our 2019 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and a second session commenced in October 2021.\nBased on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result\nin an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in\nexcess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2021, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of\nadditional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNote 15.\nSegment and Geographical Information\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of\nApps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL\nincludes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. As of December 31, 2021 ,\nour operating segments are the same as our reportable segments.\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using\ninformation about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. The CODM does not evaluate\noperating segments using asset or liability information.\n108\nTable of Contents\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include\ncertain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with the partnership arrangements,\nconsumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments\nbased on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the\noperating segments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to\nthe operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities,\ninformation technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security\nexpenses, are mostly allocated based on headcount.\nThe following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions).\nFor comparative purposes, amounts in prior periods have been recast:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021         2020         2019\nRevenue:\nFamily of Apps                    $                  115,655    $  84,826    $  70,196\nReality Labs                                           2,274        1,139          501\nTotal revenue                     $                  117,929    $  85,965    $  70,697\nIncome (loss) from operations:\nFamily of Apps                    $                   56,946    $  39,294    $  28,489\nReality Labs                                         -10,193       -6,623       -4,503\nTotal income from operations      $                   46,753    $  32,671    $  23,986\nFor information regarding revenue disaggregated by geography, see Note 2 — Revenue.\nThe following table sets forth our long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment,\nnet and operating lease right-of-use assets (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2021         2020\nUnited States              $        55,497    $  43,128\nRest of the world(1)                14,467       11,853\nTotal long-lived assets    $        69,964    $  54,981\n_________________________\n(1) No individual country, other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total long-lived assets for any period\npresented.\n109\nTable of Contents"

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules\nand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2021 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs."

                "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life. We build\ntechnology that helps people connect and share, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers,\nvirtual reality headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world\naround them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with\naudiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected\neverywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences\nlike augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social\ntechnology. Our vision for the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of\nexperiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we\nbelieve it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is\nreflected in FoA. Ads on our platforms enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives,\nsuch as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including\non Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL reflects our efforts to develop\nthe metaverse and generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities, and the majority of our investments are directed toward\ndeveloping our family of apps. In 2022, 82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were\nrecognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $71.79 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating to headcount, data\ncenters and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We\nare also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented\nreality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the\nmetaverse. Our total RL investments were $15.88 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating to headcount and\ntechnology development across these efforts. As these are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve\nas the metaverse ecosystem develops, many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next decade.\nAlthough it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL\nsegment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse\nefforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a\ncomplex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of\nthe internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around\nadvertising, hardware, and digital goods.\nFamily of Apps Products\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups,\nand more.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nVideo, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through\nphotos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ncommunities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio and video calls.\n7\nT able of Contents\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our metaverse investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products\nthat are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new\ntechnologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using\nneuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and hardware to help build next-\ngeneration interfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality\nLabs' augmented and virtual reality products that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere. Our current\nproduct offerings include Meta Quest virtual reality devices, as well as software and content available through the\nMeta Quest Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance, including\ngaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. For example, we have launched Horizon Worlds, a social platform where\npeople can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attend virtual events, and Horizon Workrooms, a\nvirtual reality space for teams to connect and collaborate at work. As part of our virtual reality initiatives, we\nhave also introduced mixed reality capabilities through our Meta Reality system on Meta Quest Pro, which allows\nusers to experience the immersion and presence of virtual reality while still being grounded in the physical world.\nAs part of our augmented reality initiatives, we have introduced Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which let people\nstay more present through hands-free interaction, and Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to\nbuild augmented reality experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps. In general,\nwhile all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our virtual\nreality and social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and\nservices to go to market, whereas our augmented reality efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research\nand development projects. For example, in 2023, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating\nexpenses on our augmented reality initiatives, approximately 40% on our virtual reality initiatives, and\napproximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this\nexpense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to\nchange, including as the metaverse ecosystem and our business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly\nevaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and\nmarket landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and\ndiscover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We\ncompete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our\nfree or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer\nhardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our\nexisting products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts\nto develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as AI, we may become subject\nto additional competition.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and virtual reality\nincreases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We make\nsignificant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones,\nas well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and\nintegrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse.\nAcross all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI and machine learning, including to\nrecommend relevant unconnected content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, to enhance our\nadvertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and\n8\nT able of Contents\nto develop new product features using generative AI.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence.\nWe also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property,\nadvertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\ndata disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications,\ncompetition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product\nliability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and\npolitical law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy,\ncontent, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or\npenalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result,\nthe application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in\nthe new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or\nlegislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content,\nor obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products,\ncould adversely affect our financial results. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to\nreview a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various\nefforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any\nsuch changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or\noperations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services,\n9\nT able of Contents\nit could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to\ntarget ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer\nframework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July\n2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to\ntransfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial\nscrutiny. On July 6, 2022, we received a draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European Union/European\nEconomic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and\npreliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had\nreached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022,\nPresident Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence\nActivities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the\nproposed new EU-U.S. DPF. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of\n2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision is adopted by the European\nCommission and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers\nfrom the European Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant\nproducts and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented\na number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional\nchanges in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European\nUnion privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification\nobligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and\ndraft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of\nthe GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such\ninvestigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount\nof penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom,\nand other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on\nproducts and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish\ncertain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. In addition, the European Union's\nePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future\nadversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently\nenacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other\njurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the\nDigital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours,\nincluding in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design.\nThe DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable\nagainst designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us to incur significant\ncompliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA\nwill likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify\ncompetition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital\nServices Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will impose new\nrestrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our compliance costs.\nThe DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and\nTurkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local\nstorage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering\nour services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or result in fines\nor other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use\ninformation about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including with respect to minors, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, civil\n10\nT able of Contents\nrights, content moderation, and competition. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory\norders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive\nprivacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory\nauthorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including\nliability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to\nchange our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or\nuser data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and\nattention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\naffect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People are\nat the heart of every connection we empower, and we are proud of our unique company culture. We strive to build\ndiverse teams across engineering, product design, marketing, and other areas to further our mission.\nAs we look forward, we expect the lasting effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic will change how we work and who\nwe reach. We are proud of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic both internally and externally. Employee benefits\nwere robust and established quickly: we implemented 15 days of subsidized backup care for child, adult, or\neldercare; we paid emergency leave to help address short-term or transitional needs; and we established a temporary\nstipend to help employees work from home, to name just a few of the benefits.\nWe are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our global workforce, and we are focused on supporting\nour people in doing the best work of their careers, no matter where they are located. For example:\nLocation is flexible but presence is essential. As of September 30, 2022, 83% of managers at Meta had direct\nreports in a different location, and 24% of our employees were fully remote.\nRemote work has helped us reach new talent in a competitive tech landscape and broaden our representation. We\nhave seen that candidates who accepted remote job offers were more often underrepresented people.\nBeginning March 2023, we are permitting employees in eligible roles to transfer to any Meta office within their\ncountry of employment. We expect distributed teams to establish strong norms that support efficiency, including\nmore predictable and coordinated in-person working time.\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of online commerce led to\naccelerated revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even\nafter the pandemic ended. Instead, not only did online commerce return to prior trends, but the more challenging\nmacroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools, among other factors,\ncontributed to a decline in our revenue.\nTo address this new environment, we took a number of steps to become a more capital efficient company and, in\nNovember 2022, made one of the most difficult changes in Meta's history and announced a layoff of approximately\n11,000 employees. The cost reduction efforts that we announced, including our plans to scale back budgets, reduce\ncompany perks, shrink our real estate footprint, and restructure teams to increase efficiency alone would not bring\nour expenses in line with our revenue growth and we had to implement the layoff. We made it a priority to treat\noutgoing employees with respect and announced a package for U.S. employees that included:\nSeverance: 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service.\nPaid time off: payment for all remaining paid time off.\n11\nT able of Contents\nRestricted stock unit vesting: receipt of November 2022 vesting for outstanding employee restricted stock unit\nawards.\nHealth insurance: coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families for six months.\nCareer services: three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished\njob leads.\nImmigration support: dedicated immigration specialists to help guide employees based on their needs.\nWe offered similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States, taking into account local\nemployment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled and efficient workforce. In addition to permitting\nemployees to seek education reimbursement, we offer career development opportunities and work experience programs\nthat extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we utilize various learning modalities, such as\nlive virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning\ncommunities, and coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help understand how employees feel about working at Meta and\nwhat we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, and personal experience\nover time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random\nsample of employees, allows us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company changes. These\nsurveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the\ncompany.\nHealth and Well-being\nMeta's health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them\nreach their personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health,\ncreate financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community. Programs\nare designed and funded to support needs like autism care, cancer care, transgender services, holistic well-being,\nand mental health programs, which represent a few of the ways we support our employees and their dependents.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe work to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to\nbuild the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.\nWe offer full-time fully remote positions, including in locations where we do not have offices, which has deepened\nthe diversity of our candidate pool. As published in our Diversity Report in July 2022, we saw that providing\nremote optionality increased the diversity of the overall composition of our workforce: U.S candidates who accepted\nremote job offers were substantially more likely to be Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, Pacific\nIslander, veterans and/or people with disabilities, and globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were\nmore likely to be women.\nAs part of our 2022 Diversity Report, we published our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce\ndata. As of June 30, 2022, our global employee base was comprised of 37.1% females and 62.9% males, and our U.S.\nemployee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 46.5% Asian, 37.6% White, 6.7% Hispanic, 4.9% Black, 4.0%\ntwo or more ethnicities, and 0.3% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian\nor Other Pacific Islander).\nWe want our products to work for the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that. To aid\nin this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias from our hiring processes and performance management systems.\n12\nT able of Contents\nWe have also invested in learning opportunities to identify and reduce inherent bias through Diversity, Equity and\nInclusion trainings for our employees and enhanced learning and development courses. In addition, we offer career\ndevelopment programs to employees, including opportunities for women leaders at Meta to connect, support and grow\ntogether and programs to help ensure that we develop leaders of color, build a more diverse leadership pipeline and\nfoster a culture of sponsorship through leader advocacy.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2022, we announced\nthat our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and race in the United\nStates for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their dependents with resources\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and\ntime away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits, family care resources, retirement\nsavings plans, access to tax and legal services, and Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nour ability to compete effectively;\nfluctuations in our financial results;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\n14\nT able of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our\nfinancial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding,\nretaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and\nInstagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our\nactive user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher\npenetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive\nproducts and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as\nwell as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19\npandemic has led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to\nperiod at different points during the pandemic, and may continue to have a varied impact on the size and engagement\nof our active user base in the future. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and\nInstagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which\ncontributed to slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs and MAUs on Facebook in Europe\nin the first quarter and the second quarter of 2022, as well as a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in\nthe total number of MAUs on Facebook in the second quarter of 2022. Any future declines in the size of our active\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different products and services. Any\nnumber of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\n15\nT able of Contents\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we\nrely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-\nfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Privacy\nRights Act (CPRA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content, or\nusers feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our\nplatform;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the\ngeneral public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board\nregarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different\nproducts and services across our family of products;\n16\nT able of Contents\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of new technologies such as\nartificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our competitors,\nor other third parties, or otherwise;\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user\ngrowth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment);\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for\nour users to interact and share on third-party applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order\nto grow revenue.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to\ndo business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a\ncompetitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce\nour ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the\ndemand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\n17\nT able of Contents\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nadverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to\nadvertising, including developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize,\nsuch as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or\nmessaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our\nreliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates is invalid;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\napplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third\nparties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or\npotential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations;\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads,\nincluding as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA),\nother laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for\nadvertising purposes;\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\n18\nT able of Contents\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies (for example, the war in Ukraine and service\nrestrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other\nregions).\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to\nimpact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do\nnot control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to\nour users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example,\nlegislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and California Consumer Privacy Act\n(CCPA), as amended by the CPRA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such\nsignals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain\ntypes of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy\nDirective compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in\nCalifornia following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance, decisions, or new legislation in these or other\njurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, we expect to\nimplement additional changes in response to the December 2022 decision by the IDPC regarding the legal basis for\nour delivery of behavioral advertising in Europe.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and\nuse these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS\ndevelopers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue\nto negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising\nplatforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the\nability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services,\nincluding changes implemented in connection with the GDPR and other regulatory frameworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and\nnegatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by\nmarketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are\nunable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement\ncapabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising\nrevenue.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in\nthe past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our\nability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our\nability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our\nproducts or our delivery of ads have in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect,\n19\nT able of Contents\nthe usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to\nits Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most\nrelevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to\ntarget and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own advertising business. We expect that any similar\nchanges to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure\nthe effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products,\nit is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and\nstandards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers,\nand browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants\nin the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products,\nsystems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our\nproducts on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices\nor use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be\nharmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of\nour business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our\nusers and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers,\nbrowser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will\nresult in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions\nor if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be\nadversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such\noccurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices,\nwhich may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer\nhardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may\nnot be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. We are also making significant\ninvestments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, and develop new product features using generative AI. These efforts,\nincluding the introduction of new products or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced\ngovernmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results. We have also invested, and expect to continue to invest,\nsignificant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have\nhistorically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate\nmeaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to\nimplement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well as facilitate cross-app communication\nbetween these platforms, which are subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If\nour new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business\nplans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin,\nor other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our feed display and ranking\nalgorithms or other product features to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and\n20\nT able of Contents\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products,\nwhich could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we\nexpect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of\npublishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products.\nWe also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products,\nthat attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization,\nsuch as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products,\nfrom time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products\nand services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as\nquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as\nour feed or Stories products. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may\nnot produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product\nstrategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will b e a complex, evolving, and long-\nterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in\ninfrastructure as well as pri vacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies,\ndevelopers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our\nexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We\nregularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological\nchallenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have limited experience\nwith consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other companies to\ncompete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including\nif we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate\neffectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also\ndivert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make\nsignificant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our\nability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In\naddition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations\nin the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, competition,\ncontent regulation, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products\nand services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm\nour business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not be successful\nin the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of\nour new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our\nability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if\nusers do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting\nwith parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or\nregulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product\ndesign, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with\nelections, the COVID-19 pandemic, or geopolitical events, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the\nfuture adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject\nof media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of\ninternal company documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and\ncontent enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user\nwell-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in\n21\nT able of Contents\nviolation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of\nobjectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise\nenforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in\nour brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or\ninappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of\nour products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate\nopinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related\npurposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or\nobjectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic, geopolitical events, or elections\nin the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from\nthe independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our\nproducts or services on user well-being, or by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend\nparticipation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and\nenhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful.\nCertain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our\nhandling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues,\nhave eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully promote\nand maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be\nadversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that\nintegrate with our products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications\nthat integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building,\ngrowing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose\nto build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that\nintegrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers\nwith our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that\ncontinues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce\nthe volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the\nuser experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization\nopportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to\nprivacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and\nwe also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some\ninstances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely\naffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we\nare unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create,\nshare, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or\nprospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain\nbusinesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who\nbuild compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and\ndeliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new\nproducts, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as\npart of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as artificial\nintelligence, we may become subject to additional competition.\n22\nT able of Contents\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly\nengage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics\nor more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our\nproducts more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating\ncompeting platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\nsearch engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated\ncompetitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit\nour ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively.\nAs a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other\nrevenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In\naddition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that\nthese actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\n23\nT able of Contents\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\n24\nT able of Contents\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations\nand to remain competitive, including

result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our\nprivacy practices, advertising policies, product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity,\ngovernment surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are\nintegrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance\nor enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the\nquality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or\nservices on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the\npast, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of\nsignificant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech,\nand other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to\nthese topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of\nallegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may\nin the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit\nor objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical\nevents, and elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse\neffect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products,\nwhich could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have\nexperienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our\nadvertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks.\nWe are subject to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has previously significantly impacted,\nand may in the future impact, our business and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted\nin authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of\nthe virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-\nplace orders, which have previously caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain\naffected countries and regions. These developments led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our\nadvertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar effects in the\nfuture. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our business, operations, and\nworkforce to a variety of other risks, including:\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as\na result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising\npractices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or\nobjectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\n26\nT able of Contents\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us.\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and\naugmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for\nexample with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and\npromote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and\nunproven technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to\nfocus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. We have recently undertaken cost reduction measures in\nlight of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business initiatives,\nand some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to\nreduce certain longer-term expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our\nbusiness. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part\nof our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant\ninvestments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin\nand profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2022 overall operating profit by approximately\n$13.72 billion, and we expect our investments to increase in the future. If our investments are not successful\nlonger-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, in 2022, the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority directed us to divest our Giphy acquisition. In addition, in 2022, the FTC filed lawsuits against\nus to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergies and\npotential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic\ninvestments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in\nincreased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions\nthat would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions\nand we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses,\nadversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions\nor other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or\ninvestors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions\n27\nT able of Contents\nmay also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of\nsubstantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely\naffect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our\nacquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing\noperating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We\ncannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we\nacquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and\nadversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not\nbe adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays\nor outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access\nthem, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at\nall, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial\nperformance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a\ncombination of an error and a bug resulted in an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the\namount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our\nglobal community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an\nincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical\ninfrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from\nearthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict,\nother physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in\ncertain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may\nresult in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical\ninfrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our\nfinancial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to\nmaintain the availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the\nservices we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could\nsignificantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with\nthe services they provide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue\nto experience, supply and labor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical\ninfrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices, and in the future we\nmay not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs,\nor we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\n28\nT able of Contents\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\nemerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges,\namong others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of\nthese projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or\navailability of components, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other\ngeopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or\notherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or\ndegradation of the quality or reliability of our products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In\naddition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of\ndesign and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying\nequipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical\ninfrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such\ngovernment action, has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our\ntechnical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products\nand lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP))\nand Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data\nbased on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition,\nwe are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to\nimprovements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and\nfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can\nresult in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted\nby data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We\ngenerally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that\nare within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to\nindividual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates,\n29\nT able of Contents\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may\nindicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our\nFamily metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of\ncalculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics,\nwhether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family\nmetrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as\nour methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes,\nor other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match\naccounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such\nevolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include\nsuch person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not\nconstitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP\nestimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting\nsolely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate\naccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts\nwe look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of\naccess to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the\nstability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our\nmethodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate\na broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it\nis possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\n30\nT able of Contents\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 4-5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain\nuser accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our\nestimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer,\nregulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers,\nor investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in\nour metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and\ndevelopers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions,\nwhich could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.\nOur employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The\nscale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for our management, operational,\nand financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other\nthird parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the\nscale and complexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant\nexperience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage our scale\neffectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial,\nand management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our\npersonnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In\naddition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees\nand initiated several measures to scale down our office facilities. As our organization continues to evolve, and we\nare required to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to\nmaintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and\ninnovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have\nmore limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that\ncould affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages,\n31\nT able of Contents\nand we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international markets\nwhere we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are\ngenerally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain\nmarkets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available\nin China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage,\nor oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a\nvariety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and\npandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\n32\nT able of Contents\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in\nlogistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product\ndevelopment, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse\nchanges in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and\nsale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs,\nor supply chain or logistics disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety,\nthe environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them\nviolates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or\nstandards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions,\ngovernment action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and\nother factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components\nare ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in\naccurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they\nmay not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced,\ncurrently face, and will continue to face additional class action and other lawsuits based on claims related to\nadvertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, user well-being, employment, activities\non our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer\nhardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example,\nwe are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data\npractices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\n33\nT able of Contents\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our\nacquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee's\nallegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience\nsize for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of\nmultiple lawsuits related to our alleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content. The results of\nany such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits\ncould result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or\nbusiness practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\n34\nT able of Contents\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework\nunder which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than\n140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.\nAs this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and\nultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and\nseveral countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under\nwhich we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For\nexample, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include\nbusiness activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation\nvesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax\nrate. For example, in 2022, tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation increased our provision for\nincome taxes by $471 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate\nwithout such shortfalls. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the\nshare-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and\nvalue of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the\nmagnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on\nour stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our\neffective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results\nof operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg.\nAlthough we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Zuckerberg, the agreement has no specific duration\nand constitutes at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our\nbusiness by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering,\nproduct development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\n35\nT able of Contents\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In particular, we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring technical\npersonnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other\nfactors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity\nawards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to\nattract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based\ncompensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to\nattract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition,\nrestrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect\nour efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel . If we do not succeed in\nattracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be\nunable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or\nprevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our\nother stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a\ntransaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential\ninvestor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common\nstock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to\ncontrol the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death,\nthe shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has\ndesignated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in\ngood faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder,\neven a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting\ncontrol as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will\nenhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase\nvolatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of\nour stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides\nauthorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend\n36\nT able of Contents\nuser services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted.\nIn addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong\nKong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be\nadversely affected. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to\nFacebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government,\nwhich has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising,\nincluding in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we\ngenerate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is\npossible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising\nrevenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or\ninformation requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as\nimposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found\nto be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish\ngovernment could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely\nimpact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to\ncensorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to\nor elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors\nare able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets\nthat we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user\nengagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or\ngrow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of\nthese laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\nto our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user\ngrowth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights\nof publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data\nretention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection,\ncivil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade\ncontrols including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online\npayment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other\nactions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition,\nforeign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can\nimpose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result,\nthe application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in\nthe new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or\nlegislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content,\nor obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect\nthe manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on\n37\nT able of Contents\nSCCs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a\npreliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on\nSCCs in respect of European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the\nGDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers should therefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a\nrevised preliminary draft decision in which the IDPC maintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers\nshould be suspended. The IDPC's draft decision was then further refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with other\nEuropean data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism. Separately, on March 25,\n2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on\nEnhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the\nEuropean Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new EU-U.S. DPF. On January 19, 2023, the\nIDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), pursuant to the dispute\nresolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus could\nnot be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as\nearly as the first quarter of 2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision\nis adopted by the European Commission and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative\nmeans of data transfers from the European Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of\nour most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we have been managing\ninvestigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the 2016 and 2021 updates to\nWhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and\nservices, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer\ndata between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among\nour products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our\nservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented\na number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant\npenalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The\ninterpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection\nregulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights\nAct (CPRA), also establishes certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including\nlimitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes\nfor which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive\nprivacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are\nevolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of\nadvertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our\nadvertising business. For example, state regulators in California and Colorado are considering adopting regulations\nthat could further limit how companies can use personal information for advertising purposes. In Europe, regulators\ncontinue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and\nsimilar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such\ntechnologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on\nthe use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our\nproducts or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected,\nand may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative\nproposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level,\nas well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.\nFor example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours,\nincluding in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design.\nThe DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable\nagainst designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us to incur significant\ncompliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA\nwill likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to\n38\nT able of Contents\nmodify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the\nDigital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will\nimpose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our\ncompliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such\nas India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity\nof delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or\nresult in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect\nand use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased\ncompliance costs, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and\nreputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm\nour business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including\nwith respect to minors, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition. In\naddition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example,\ndata protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and other jurisdictions\nhave initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect\nand use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March\n2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of\ncertain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In\nJuly 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved\nby the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to\npay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and\noversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of\ncertain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the\nIDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. We have in the past been, and may\nin the future be, subject to fines and requirements to changes to our business practices as a result of such\ninquiries and investigations. In addition, we are subject to a lawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the\n“tag suggestions” and other facial recognition features on our products.\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business,\nincluding with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition,\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we also became subject to lawsuits\nby the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things.\nThe complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged\nviolations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram\nand WhatsApp. In addition, in December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that\nwe tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example,\n39\nT able of Contents\nbeginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations\nand the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business\npractices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data\npractices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other\nregulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our\nbusiness practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and\nfinancial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\nrequirements around the world, such as the CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and DSA. In particular, we are\nmaintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial\nmanagement and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations,\nprohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance\nwith the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party\nassessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance\nand oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are\nreallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an\nadverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to\nour business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming,\nand costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a\ntimely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and\noversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The\nrequirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly\nto our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full\ncompliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any\nsuch issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly\nevolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we will be subject to\nnew restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services\nand product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. If we are\nunable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CPRA, ePrivacy\nDirective, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation of the\nconsent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or\nlawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or other penalties, and we may also be\nrequired to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including our policies, algorithms, and enforcement actions with\nrespect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to\ndefamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property\nrights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of\ncontent, online safety, products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example,\nwe have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on\nallegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. The potential risks relating to any of\nthe foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions\n40\nT able of Contents\noutside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we\nmay be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European\nUnion passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright\ninfringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing\ninto their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive\nto apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states have begun to implement. In the United States, the\nU.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online\nplatforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have\nbeen, and continue to be, various state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the\nscope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect\nto commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current\nprotections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We\ncould also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-\nimposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has\nresulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to\ncomply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other\ncountries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar\nlegislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans,\nfor failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to\nfines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey,\nand we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also\nhas required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices,\nincrease our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies.\nFor example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for\ncopyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to\nmake substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright\nDirective may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services will be\nsubject to new restrictions and requirements, and our compliance costs may significantly increase, as a result of\nthe Digital Services Act in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, and\npotentially other content-related legislative developments such as proposed online safety bills in Ireland and the\nUnited Kingdom. Certain countries have also proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain\nnews content shared on our products. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230\nor the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase\nour costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely\naffect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual,\nand digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send\nmoney to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing\nanti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other\nprepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable\nfundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we\nmay also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase\nflexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally\nrequire us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with\nthese laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not\nguarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory\nrequirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be\nrequired to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the\n41\nT able of Contents\ninvestment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We\nhave also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional\npayments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing\nrisks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general\nhacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our\nsystems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase\nads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other\nobjectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data\nand content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving\nnew and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and\nattacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors,\nand we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address\nundesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may\ncause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose\nconfidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts\nto protect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform,\nmay also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor\nerror or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or\nofferings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or\nother threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to\ndisclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in\nsophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have\ndeveloped systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to\ndisable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot\nassure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or\nthat our remediation efforts will be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of certain\npersonnel working remotely could also impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to protect against\nattacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur\nsignificant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business\npractices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\n42\nT able of Contents\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify\nadditional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy,\nsafety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of\nthese efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce,\nadditional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all\nsuch incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of\nvisibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other\nprojects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy\nassessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents\nand activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner\ninconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election\ninterference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances\nof spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. We may also be\nunsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Consequences of any\nof the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and\nbrands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business\nand financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries,\nwhich could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to\nenhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and\ninternal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage\nimmense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain,\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise\nour ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and\nmay only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September\n2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely, or\nhuman error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a\nnegative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in\na manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements,\ntargeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our\nintellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For\nexample, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within\nand across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us\nfrom fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our\nsystems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical\nlimitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our\ncommitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our\nreputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for\nfines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n43\nT able of Contents\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we\ndeveloped available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of\nour open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these\nevents could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights\nclaims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other\nintellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products\nand services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number\nof intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we\nexpect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other\nintellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and\nthere can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may\nseek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation,\nincluding potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to\nsettle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are\na party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal.\nThe terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\nviolation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop\nalternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative\nnon-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense, could result in less effective\ntechnology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have\nexperienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the\ndisputes and litigation referred to above.\n44\nT able of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2022. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely\naffect our business.\n45\nT able of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do\nnot expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a\nreturn on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of\nour Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting\npower of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to\nour stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your\nability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n46\nT able of Contents\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n47\nT able of Contents"

                "content": "Legal Proceedings\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case,\nand the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With respect to the multiple\nputative class actions filed against us beginning on March 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer\nprotection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of\nconsumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement\nto resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion\nand to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys\ngeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead\n48\nT able of Contents\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the\nlawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of\nEuropean Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and\npreliminarily proposed that transfers of such user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a revised preliminary draft decision in which the IDPC\nmaintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers should be suspended. The IDPC's draft decision was then\nfurther refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with other European data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the\nGDPR's consistency mechanism. Separately, on October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on\nEnhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities, and on December 13, 2022, the European\nCommission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. On\nJanuary 19, 2023, the IDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the European Data Protection Board, pursuant to the\ndispute resolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus\ncould not be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may\nissue as early as the first quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our\nbusiness is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and\ndata protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceeding) could subject us\nto substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal,\nby competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries,\nand lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and\nby maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became\nthe subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December\n9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in\nanticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and\nWhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we\nviolated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys\ngeneral both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and\nother equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the\ncourt granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's\ncomplaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the\nattorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended\ncomplaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been\nfiled in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of\nantitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss\nthe consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class\naction brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the\nfirst amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an alleged\nviolation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in\n49\nT able of Contents\ntheir administrative court seeking to permanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton\nAct, and seeking other relief as well. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending\nthem. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook\nMarketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. The result of\nsuch litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt\nor require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business,\nor subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand California state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in teenage users,\nresulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action alleging similar harms was also filed\nin California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and three school districts recently filed public\nnuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. The state court proceedings are now pending before a trial\njudge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously\ndefending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning\nthe use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe\nthese lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed\ncertain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29,\n2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order,\nand the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are\nvigorously defending it.\nIn July 2017, an individual filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and other companies for allegedly violating the Anti-Terrorism Act by aiding, abetting, and providing\nmaterial support to an organization that committed an international terrorist act, and seeking unspecified damages.\nIn October 2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss. In June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit reversed the judgment. On October 3, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the judgment in\nthis action, along with a companion case against another company in which the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review\nthe scope of protection available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section\n230). We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it. However, changes to the\nprotections available under Section 230 may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products,\nbusiness practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag\nsuggestions\" and other facial recognition features on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric\nIdentifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and\ninjunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe this lawsuit is without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending it.\n50\nT able of Contents\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional\nlegal proceedings and disputes."

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2022 using 2021 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. In 2022, we\ncontinued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with\nconsumers and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest in both our family of\napps and our metaverse efforts based on our company priorities.\nOur financial results and key community metrics for 2022 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2022 was\n$116.61 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2021, which reflects a $5.96 billion negative impact from the\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. Revenue on a constant currency basis was\n$122.57 billion for 2022, an increase of 4% compared to 2021. Our advertising revenue was impacted by a reduction\nin advertising demand during 2022 compared to 2021, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer\nspending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment, as well as limitations on our ad targeting\nand measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment. Our average price per ad\ndecreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022, partially offset by a n 18% year-over-year increase in ad impressions\ndelivered across our Family of Apps.\nIncome from operations for 2022 was $28.94 billion, a decrease of $17.81 billion, or 38%, compared to 2021, mainly\ndue to an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with a 20% increase in employee headcount\nparticularly in engineering and other technical functions and higher operational expenses related to our data\ncenters and technical infrastructure. Starting in the third quarter of 2022, we began a series of cost management\ninitiatives including facilities consolidation, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, and a pivot in our data\ncenter strategy, which resulted in total restructuring charges of $4.61 billion in 2022.

Our reported headcount includes\na substantial majority of the approximately 11,000 employees impacted by the layoff we announced in November 2022,\nwho will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nRestructuring\nIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic\npriorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several\noffice buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL\nsegments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center\nprojects.\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows\n(in millions) :\nFacilities       Severance and Other\nConsolidation           Personnel Costs       Data Center Assets       Total\nCost of revenue         $                    154    $                    —    $               1,341    $  1,495\nResearch and                               1,311                       408                        —       1,719\ndevelopment\nMarketing and sales                          404                       234                        —         638\nGeneral and                                  426                       333                        —         759\nadministrative\nTotal                   $                  2,295    $                  975    $               1,341    $  4,611\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million.\nThese charges lowered our operating margin by four percentage points and diluted earnings per share (EPS) by $1.34.\nThe impact of severance and other personnel costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 was not material after\noffsetting with the savings from the decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding restructuring charges.\n55\nT able of Contents\nFamily of Apps Metrics\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.96 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 5% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.00 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.96 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 2% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 18% year-over-year in 2022 , and the average\nprice per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022 .\nDevelopments in Advertising\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on\ntargeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and\nwe expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad\ntargeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\nsystems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy\nDirective, and California Privacy Rights Act have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and\nwe expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a\nresult, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our products and user data practices,\nwhich reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser\nproviders, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the\nability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising.\nFor example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes\nto its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising,\nwhich has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our\nad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities\nwhile reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated\nthird-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems,\nas well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to\ninnovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing\ngrowing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are\nmaking significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting,\nand measurement capabilities. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of\nnew open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We expect that some of\nthese efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the regulatory and platform developments described above will\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will\ncontinue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe\nadvertising budgets have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market\nuncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitive products and services have\nreduced some users' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we have\nintroduced new features such as Reels and are investing in our artificial intelligence-powered discovery engine to\nrecommend relevant unconnected content across our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it is not currently\nmonetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size\nof our active user base in one or more markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in\nUkraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the\nRussian government, which adversely affected user growth and engagement in 2022 . These trends adversely affected\nadvertising revenue in 2022 , and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable\nfuture.\n56\nT able of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our business and results of operations, with a varied impact on user growth\nand engagement, as well as the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. While we experienced a\nreduction in advertising demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the\npandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, and we experienced\nincreasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this growth has declined,\nand we saw continued softening of advertising demand in 2022 as many activities that shifted online during COVID-19\nrelated lockdowns resumed in person. We may experience similar volatility in the demand for and pricing of our\nadvertising services as a result of the pandemic in the future.\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have\nperfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex\njudgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the\nglobe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to\nidentify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to\nquantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.\nInvestment Philosophy\nIn 2022 , we continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the\nmajor social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new\nexperiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the\nfuture; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow\nand create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in\nthe world.\nWe anticipate that investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount will\ncontinue to drive expense growth in 2023, which will adversely affect our operating margin and profitability. The\nmajority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2022 , 82% of our total costs and\nexpenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to\nheadcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising\nservices. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and\naugmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies\nfor the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across\nthese efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for\nproducts for the metaverse that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade.\nAlthough it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL\nsegment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse\nefforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a\ncomplex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of\nthe internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around\nadvertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n57\nT able of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\nSubstantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile\ndevices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDAP/MAP:    79%    79%    79%    78%    79%    79%    79%    79%    79%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n60 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family\nmetrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such\nupdate contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022.\nWorldwide DAP increased 5% to 2.96 billion on average during December 2022 from 2.82 billion during December 2021.\n58\nT able of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors.

In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n70 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family\nmetrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such\nupdate contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 3.74 billion MAP, an increase of 4% from 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n59\nT able of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $8.62    $7.75    $8.36    $8.18    $9.39    $7.72    $7.91    $7.53    $8.63\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $31.79, a\ndecrease of 6% from 2021.\n60\nT able of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.

Users in India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during\nDecember 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 2.96 billion MAUs, an increase of 2% from December 31, 2021. Users in India,\nNigeria, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.\n62\nT able of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nWhile the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate\nthat revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total\nrevenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our\nFamily products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize\nusers in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &\nCanada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile\nadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2022 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher\nthan in the Asia-Pacific region.\nARPU:    $10.14    $9.27    $10.12    $10.00    $11.57    $9.54    $9.82    $9.41    $10.86\n$  …    $  …    $  …    $  …    $  …    …    …    …    …    …    …    …    …    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\n63\nT able of Contents\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $39.63, a\ndecrease of 3% from 2021. For 2022, ARPU decreased by 9% in Europe and 4% in United States & Canada, and increased\nby 4% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was mostly in geographies with relatively\nlower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily\nconcentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may decrease at a higher\nrate, or increase at a slower rate, relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or\npotentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.\n64\nT able of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the\nlevels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such\nmatters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is\nmaterial. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition,\nvaluation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets\nincluding goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives,\nwhen applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we\nconsider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our\nsignificant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes\nto consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating\nwhether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis.\nIn this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred\nto the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory\nrisk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent\nin a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.\nValuation of Non-marketable Equity Securities\nFor our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the\nmeasurement alternative, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar\nto the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and\nobligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and\nconversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to,\nrights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the\nidentification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our\ninvestee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair\nvalue adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction\nactually occurred. For non-marketable equity securities, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date\nto determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such\nas, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance;\nregulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events\nand factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-\nmarketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in\nthe consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair\nvalue requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and\nmarket data of comparable companies, among others.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate\n65\nT able of Contents\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development\ntax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our\nactivities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for\nour uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with\nthe income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the\nrefinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is\nmade, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 13 — Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 16 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated\nUseful Lives\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to\nmake significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in\nvaluing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected\ncash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade\n66\nT able of Contents\nnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and\nliabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the\nuseful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the\nmeasurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We\nhave two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill\nhas been identified.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from\nthe use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining\nestimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts\nand circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as\nchanges to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted\nfor prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised remaining useful life.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of our servers and network assets category effective the second and the fourth\nquarters of 2022. The financial impact of the changes in estimates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $860\nmillion and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing\nas of the effective date of the change and applying the revised useful lives prospectively.\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K, for additional information regarding the changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network\nassets.\n67\nT able of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad\nproducts either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number\nof impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels\nproducts are not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we\nincrease or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We\ncalculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing\nthe average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For\nadvertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and\nrevenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest , wearables, and\nrelated software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of\nour products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related\nexpenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally,\ncost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-\ncancelable contractual commitments.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which\ninclude share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who\nare responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development\ncosts, and professional services.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales\nsupport, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also\ninclude professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human\nresources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which\ninclude estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as\nother legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.\n68\nT able of Contents\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2021.

The decrease was mostly driven by advertising\nrevenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2022 decreased $1.29 billion, or 1%, compared to 2021 due to a decrease in the average price\nper ad, partially offset by an increase in the number of ads delivered. In 2022, the average price per ad decreased\nby 16%, as compared with an increase of 24% in 2021. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase\nin the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products such as video and Reels that monetize at\nlower rates, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, the decrease in average price per ad was\nimpacted by a reduction in advertising demand, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending\nas a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement\ntools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the other factors\ndiscussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results.\" In 2022, the number of ads\ndelivered increased by 18%, as compared with a 10% increase in 2021. Ads impressions grew in all regions during\n2022, mostly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads\ndelivered during 2022 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and\nan increase in users. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and\nthe number of ads delivered.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2022 decreased $115 million, or 5%, compared to 2021. The decrease in RL revenue was driven by a\ndecrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.\nRevenue Seasonality and Customer Concentration\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 16%, and\n31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 declined 17%, 7%, and 16% compared to the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019,\nrespectively.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2022 compared\nto the same period in 2021 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year\n2022 using the prior\n70\nT able of Contents\nyear's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total\nrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $122.57 billion and $119.54 billion, respectively. Using these\nconstant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $5.96 billion and $5.90 billion higher than\nactual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022. Using the same constant rates,\nfull year 2022 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $4.64 billion and $4.60 billion, respectively,\nhigher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2021.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                       2022 vs 2021 %       2021 vs 2020 %\n2022            2021            2020               change               change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nCost of          $          25,249       $  22,649       $  16,692                   11  %                36  %\nrevenue\nPercentage of                   22  %           19  %           19  %\nrevenue\nCost of revenue in 2022 increased $2.60 billion, or 11%, compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to an\nincrease in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, adjusted for a decrease\nin the depreciation growth rate due to extensions in the useful lives of servers and network assets. In addition,\nwe recorded $1.34 billion of abandonment charges related to data center assets.

Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects of integrating intellectual\nproperty from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the\neffects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 27,\n2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2023 to be\nin the low twenties. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and\ndevelopment expenses incurred in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory\ncapitalization requirement increased our 2022 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax\nrate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement\nis deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax\nliabilities could be several billion dollars lower.\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions\nthat have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and\nour effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of\nthis impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well\nas the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\nOn August 16, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The key tax provisions applicable to us\nare a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023.\nWe do\n73\nT able of Contents\nnot expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position; however, we will\ncontinue to evaluate their impact as further information becomes available.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits . As of December 31, 2022, we had net uncertain tax positions of $5.49 billion which were\naccrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related\nto transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing\nservices and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax\ncredits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or\nevents that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described\nbelow and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such\namounts within the next 12 months.\nSee Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\n74\nT able of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated\nfrom operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks,\ninvestments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $40.74 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.26 billion from December 31, 2021. The majority of the decrease was due to\n$32.04 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $27.96 billion repurchases\nof our Class A common stock, $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted\nstock unit (RSU) awards, and $1.31 billion for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets. These decreases\nwere partially offset by $50.48 billion of cash generated from operations and $9.92 billion of net proceeds from\nthe issuance of fixed-rate senior notes (the \"Notes\") in August 2022.\nCash paid for income taxes was $6.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our\nfederal net operating loss carryforward was $196 million and our federal tax credit carryforward was $276 million.\nWe anticipate the utilization of most of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years.\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $27.93 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87\nbillion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion of\nrepurchases was authorized under this program.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   50,475    $   57,683    $   38,747\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                  -28,970    $   -7,570    $  -30,059\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -22,136    $  -50,728    $  -10,292\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2022 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash\nitems, such as $11.99 billion of share-based compensation expense, $8.69 billion of depreciation and amortization,\nand $3.56 billion of impairment for leases, leasehold improvements, and abandonment charges for data center assets\nrelated to our restructuring efforts. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2022 compared to\n2021 was mainly du e to a decrease in net income as adjusted for the aforementioned non-cash items, partially\noffset by changes in working capital.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $31.19 billion of net purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.53\nbillion proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities. The increase in cash used in\ninvesting activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to an increase in net purchases of property and\nequipment, and a decrease in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $33 billion in 2023.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $27.96 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $9.92\nbillion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2022\ncompared to 2021 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock and proceeds from the\nissuance of the Notes.\n75\nT able of Contents\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nNet cash provided by operating              $                   50,475    $   57,683    $   38,747\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment, net                       -31,186       -18,567       -15,115\nPrincipal payments on finance leases                              -850          -677          -604\nFree Cash Flow                              $                   18,439    $   38,439    $   23,028\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be\nsufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months\nand thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including\nour access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our\nfinance lease obligations mostly include certain network infrastructure. Our restructuring efforts to sublease,\nearly terminate or abandon several office buildings under operating leases did not materially change our operating\nlease obligations.\nOur contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and\nconsumer hardware products in Reality Labs.\n76\nT able of Contents\nLong-term Debt\nIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of the Notes. The Notes were issued in\nfour series, which mature from 2027 through 2062. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as\nof December 31, 2022 are $411 million and $7.69 billion, respectively. We intend to use the net proceeds from the\noffering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures,\nrepurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.\nTaxes\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had taxes payable of $1.51 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable\nincurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $361 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we\nwill pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include\n$5.49 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Due to uncertainties in the timing of\nthe completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to\nmake a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 9 — Leases, Note 11 — Long-term Debt, Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 — Income Taxes\nin the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and \"Legal Proceedings\"\ncontained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding leases and\ncontractual commitments, long-term debt, taxes, and contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n77\nT able of Contents"

                "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\nprice risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in\nthe future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $81 million, $140 million, and $129 million were recognized in\n2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash\nequivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits,\nmoney market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\ndebt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our\nliquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents,\nand marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\nmarket interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $558 million and $714 million in the market value of our\navailable-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any\nrealized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized losses would\nonly occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we also had $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes (the\n\"Notes\") outstanding. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations\nin interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the\nNotes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and\ndeclining in periods of increasing interest rates.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments are substantially all in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price\nrisks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for most of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative,\nwhich is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for\nidentical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to\ndetermine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as,\nbut not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance;\neconomic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of\nour non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable\ntransactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the\nvaluation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in\nour investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $6.20 billion and $6.78 billion\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n78\nT able of Contents\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity\nSecurities, Note 7 — Fair Value Measurements, and Note 11 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item\n7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n79\nT able of Contents"

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n81\nT able of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nloss contingencies was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments\nof the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential\namount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence\nof a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses,\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the\nmeetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested\nand received internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss\nthe nature of the various matters, and obtained representations\nfrom management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the\nrelated disclosures included in Note 13 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n82\nT able of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2023\n83\nT able of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the\nCompany) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2023 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2023\n84\nT able of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring\nthe world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the\nmetaverse to life.\nW e report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) . The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. W e generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,\nvaluation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, including the ultimate resolution\nof litigation, regulatory matters, and asserted and unasserted claims, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses\nof available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, and fair\nvalue of leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of\nregulations, and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially\nfrom those estimates.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of a majority of the servers and network assets from four yearsto 4.5years,\neffective the second quarter of 2022, and further extended the useful lives to five yearseffective the fourth\nquarter of 2022. The changes in estimated useful lives were due to expected longer refresh cycles in our data\ncenters. The financial impact of the changes was a reduction in depreciation expense of $ 860million and an\nincrease in net income of $ 693million, or $ 0.26per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact\nfrom the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the\neffective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n91\nT able of Contents\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded\nwithin marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the\nright to invoice for services performed.\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through\nagent.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\nmobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party\npublishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements\nwhere we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related\nsoftware and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which\nis generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in\nexchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from\nWhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products.\nThese include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost\nof revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit\ncard and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue\nincludes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable\ncontractual commitments.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted\nand available\n92\nT able of Contents\nfor viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for\ncapitalization were not material to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended.\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n93\nT able of Contents\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.65billion, $ 2.99billion, and $ 2.26billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90\ndays or less from the date of purchase.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting mostly of U.S. government securities, U.S. government\nagency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as\navailable-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for\ncurrent operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses,\nnet of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt\nsecurities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of\nthat difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities\nare recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income,\nand any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in\nstockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nwere not material. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific\nidentification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, and\nretention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and\nother assets on the consolidated balance sheets based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The\nchange in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated\nstatements of income. We periodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators\nexist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we write down the investment to\nfair value.During the year ended December 31, 2022, losses resulted from such remeasurements were $ 447million.\nGains and losses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. For additional\ninformation, see Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n94\nT able of Contents\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy because their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models\nutilizing observable market inputs. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks measured at fair\nvalue and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets\nin active markets to estimate their fair value. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors\nused to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on\na non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions\noccur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowances for accounts receivable\nwere immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at\ncost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets\nare described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           FourtoFive years\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , we recorded\n$ 1.34billion of abandonment charges for data center construction in progress (CIP) assets under Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) Topic 360 related to our restructuring efforts . For additional information regarding\nour restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\n95\nT able of Contents\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining\ncarrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated\nuseful life. See section \"Use of Estimates\" above for additional information regarding changes in the estimated\nuseful lives of our servers and network assets.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in\nprogress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\nservice for their intended use.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such\nsale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, colocations, land, network infrastructure, and\nother equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is\na lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease\ncomponents and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such\nas contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such\nvariable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and\nequipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar\neconomic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment losses of $ 2.22billion in aggregate for operating\nlease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation\nrestructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models\n(income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating\nfair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income\nover the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving\nfuture cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\n96\nT able of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration\nto identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets\nare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not\namortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related\nexpenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units subject to goodwill\nimpairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not\nrecoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We\nhave not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\n97\nT able of Contents\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax of $ 1.86billion and $ 677million,\nrespectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 81million, $\n140million, and $ 129million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly\nof money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities\nconsist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\ncorporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified\namong individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 was not\nmaterial.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 40%, 41%, and 42% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of\nrevenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Canada,\nAustralia and Japan.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2022, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic\n805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which\nclarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a\nbusiness combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn July 1, 2022, we early adopted ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of\nEquity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASU 2022-03), which clarifies and amends the guidance\nof measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the\nequity securities. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn October 1, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities\nabout Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance received\n98\nT able of Contents\nby most business entities by requiring annual disclosures of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2)\nthe accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial\nstatements. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions).

As a result, we recorded impairment charges for the\nrelated operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and leasehold improvements.\nIn November 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000of our employees across the FoA and RL segments. As\na result, we recorded severance and other personnel related expenses for the impacted employees.\nIn December 2022, we reevaluated our data center investment strategy to improve efficiency and further advance our\nefforts around artificial intelligence. As a result, we decided to pivot several of our data center building\nprojects to a next generation design while also canceling multiple existing data center projects. This strategy led\nto abandonment charges of the related data center assets.\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows\n(in millions) :\nFacilities       Severance and Other\nConsolidation(1)           Personnel Costs       Data Center Assets       Total\nCost of revenue              $               154    $                    —    $               1,341    $  1,495\nResearch and development                   1,311                       408                        —       1,719\nMarketing and sales                          404                       234                        —         638\nGeneral and                                  426                       333                        —         759\nadministrative\nTotal                        $             2,295    $                  975    $               1,341    $  4,611\n________________________\n(1) Facilities consolidation includes impairment charges and accelerated expenses related to certain operating\nlease ROU assets and leasehold improvements.\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $ 4.10billion and RL segment were $ 515million.\nThe following table is a summary of the changes in the severance and other personnel liabilities, included within\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, related to the workforce\nreduction (in millions):\nBalance as of January 1, 2022                —\nSeverance and other personnel costs        975\nCash payments during the period           -203\nBalance as of December 31, 2022(1)     $   772\n__________________________\n(1) We expect the remaining severance and termination related liabilities to be substantially paid out in cash\nduring the first half of 2023.\n100\nT able of Contents\nNote 4.\nEarnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings\nare allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of\ndilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plan.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the\nweighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 95million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as including them would have an anti-\ndilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2022                     2021                     2020\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,285         402        2,383         432        2,407         444\nearnings per share\nBasic EPS               $                    8.63    $   8.63    $   13.99    $  13.99    $   10.22    $  10.22\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            3,471           —        6,042           —        4,539           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —         -19            —         -93            —         -58\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  23,200    $  3,452    $  39,370    $  5,949    $  29,146    $  4,481\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,285         402        2,383         432        2,407         444\nearnings per share\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           402           —          432           —          444           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive                             15           —           44           —           37           —\nRSUs\nShares used in\ncomputation of                              2,702         402        2,859         432        2,888         444\ndiluted\nearnings per share\nDiluted EPS             $                    8.59    $   8.59    $   13.77    $  13.77    $   10.09    $  10.09\n101\nT able of Contents\nNote 5.

As a result, the parental guarantee by Meta Platforms, Inc. was\nno longer required.\nContractual Commitments\nWe have $ 19.91billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2022, which are primarily\nrelated to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs. The\nfollowing is a schedule, by years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n2023          $  13,203\n2024              2,295\n2025              1,434\n2026                265\n2027                209\nThereafter        2,504\nTotal         $  19,910\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase\nrenewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components\nthat do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. We enter into these agreements in order to secure either\nvolume or price. Using the projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend as of\nDecember 31, 2022\n110\nT able of Contents\nis approximately $ 10.34billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years. The ultimate spend under these\nagreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\nIn January 2023, we entered into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy in the amount of approximately\n$ 1.6billion.\nLegal and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case,\nand the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With respect to the multiple\nputative class actions filed against us beginning on March 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer\nprotection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of\nconsumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement\nto resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $ 725million by us and is subject to court approval. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified\nconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of\nour directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders\nfiled an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary\nduty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and\nconsolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, we are currently subject to an IDPC inquiry regarding Meta Platforms Ireland's\nability to transfer European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data to the United States, which is\ndescribed further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\ninterpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts\nfor loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material in the\naggregate.\n111\nT able of Contents\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand California state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in teenage users,\nresulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action alleging similar harms was also filed\nin California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and threeschool districts recently filed public\nnuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. The state court proceedings are now pending before a trial\njudge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously\ndefending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning\nthe use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe\nthese lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed\ncertain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29,\n2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order,\nand the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are\nvigorously defending it.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and\ngovernment inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our\nbusiness practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile\nor online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it\nhad opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair\nmethods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp\n112\nT able of Contents\nin 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of\n2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys\ngeneral. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of\nColumbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram\nin 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged\nthat we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and\nattorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28,\n2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing\nthe FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28,\n2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an\namended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11,\n2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also\nbeen filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging\nviolations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss\nthe consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class\naction brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the\nfirst amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an alleged\nviolation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in their administrative court seeking to\npermanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and seeking other relief as\nwell. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the\nEuropean Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use\ndata in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag\nsuggestions\" and other facial recognition features on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric\nIdentifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and\ninjunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe this lawsuit is without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending it.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted\nlegal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments\non a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these\nother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these\nother matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 16 — Income Taxes.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties.\n113\nT able of Contents\nThese agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees,\nand our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2022, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability\nfor costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2022.\nNote 14.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31,\n2022, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote,\nwhile the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock\nare convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares\nof our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are collectively referred\nto as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 2,247million shares of Class A common stock and 367million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, $ 38.79billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161million shares\nof our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 27.93billion. As of December 31, 2022, $ 10.87billion\nremained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $ 40billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nShare-based Compensation Plan\nWe have oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which\nwas amended in each of June 2016, February 2018, and December 2022. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance\nof incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance\nshares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in\nconnection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 66million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under\nour Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of\nshares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of\nthe Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal\nto the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the\nimmediately preceding\n114\nT able of Contents\nDecember 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase\nprovision, our board of directors approved an increase of 56million shares of Class A common stock reserved for\nissuance, effective January 1, 2023.\nIn December 2022, our board of directors approved an amendment to our Amended 2012 Plan to increase the number of\nshares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan by 425million shares, effective March 1, 2023 (Plan\nAmendment). The Plan Amendment was also approved by holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock in December 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)                                    Per Share\nUnvested at December 31, 2021              98,848    $                                  244.32\nGranted                                   106,693    $                                  195.66\nVested                                    -54,013    $                                  218.24\nForfeited                                 -24,418    $                                  231.98\nUnvested at December 31, 2022             127,110    $                                  216.93\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n305.40and $ 188.73, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 9.44billion, $ 14.42billion, and $ 9.38billion, respectively.\nThe income tax benefit recognized related to awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nwas $ 2.0billion, $ 3.08billion, and $ 1.81billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 26.01billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSU\nawards.

We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 276million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 3.72billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock\nownership change of greater than 50% over a three‑yearperiod.\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022        2021        2020\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑           $                    9,807    $  8,692    $  7,863\nbeginning of period\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                210         328         356\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                               -172         -86        -253\npositions\nIncreases related to current year tax                            1,166         963       1,045\npositions\nDecreases related to settlements of                               -254         -90        -319\nprior year tax positions\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of    $                   10,757    $  9,807    $  8,692\nperiod\n117\nT able of Contents\nThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our\nforeign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions,\nas well as for the uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all years presented, we recognized interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated\nstatements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $\n1.07billion and $ 960million, respectively.\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 10.76billion as of December 31, 2022 were realized in a\nfuture period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 6.49billion within our provision of income taxes at such\ntime.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in\nAugust 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe\nthat, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed\nU.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2022, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional\ntax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n118\nT able of Contents\nNote 17.

Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include\ncertain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer\nhardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a\nreasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating\nsegments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs."

                "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life. We build\ntechnology that helps people connect and share, find communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people\nto connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality (VR) and\nmixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the\nworld around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with\naudiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected\neverywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences\nlike augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social\ntechnology. Our vision for the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of\nexperiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we\nbelieve it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction. Across our work, we are\ninnovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more\nsocial, useful, and immersive.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is\nreflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such\nas generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of\nconsumer hardware products, software, and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2024, we intend to focus on six key investment areas:\nAI, the metaverse, our discovery engine, monetization of our products and services, regulatory readiness, and\nenhancing developer efficiency to build, iterate, and optimize products quickly. Our AI investments support\ninitiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our\ndiscovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of\nnew generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive.\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2023, 80% of our total costs\nand expenses were recognized in FoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $70.13 billion in 2023\nand include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts,\nincluding developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and\nother foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $18.02 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating\nto headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we\nexpect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, and many products for the metaverse may only be fully\nrealized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem\nwill develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability\nto support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We\nexpect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is\nthe next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and\ncreators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\nFamily of Apps Products\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups,\nMarketplace, and more.\n7\nTable of Contents\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nLive, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video,\nand private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ncommunities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.\nThreads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come\ntogether to discuss topics of interest. People can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who\nlove the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their ideas, opinions, and creativity with\nthe world.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a\none-to-many broadcast service designed to help people follow information from people and organizations that are\nimportant to them.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our metaverse investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products\nthat are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new\ntechnologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using\nneuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the\nnear term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality Labs products that help people\nfeel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nOur current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well as software and content available\nthrough the Meta Quest Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical\ndistance while engaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. For example, Meta Horizon Worlds is a social\nplatform where people can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attend virtual events.\nTo drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have also introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to\nexperience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta\nQuest Pro and Meta Quest 3 devices.\nWe have continued to advance our augmented reality (AR) roadmap to include offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart\nglasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as offer the ability to livestream\nvideo and let people stay more present through hands-free interaction. We also offer Meta Spark, a platform that\nallows creators and businesses to build AR experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our\napps.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our VR\nand social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to\ngo to market, whereas our AR efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and development projects.\nFor example, in 2024, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our AR\ninitiatives, approximately 40% on our VR (including MR) initiatives, and approximately 10% on social platforms and\nother initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared\ncosts across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse ecosystem and\nour business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant\nchanges as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs\nevolve.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and\ndiscover content and information online or\n8\nTable of Contents\nenable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people\nwho use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services,\nand to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also\ncompete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and\nservices. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing\nproducts evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop\nthe metaverse or innovate through the development and application of new technologies such as AI.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video, VR, and MR\nincreases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have\ndesigned and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion\nof our technical infrastructure is also provided by third parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate\nour products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network capacity.\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new\nones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and\nintegrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse.\nAcross all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to,\namong other things, recommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance\nour advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new\nproducts as well as new features for existing products.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate offices in approximately 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales\npresence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and\npartners.\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers,\nresellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel, Meta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and\nenterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of\npublicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data\nretention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic\ncontracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls\nincluding sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment\nservices. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and\nregulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States, and create the\npotential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced\nby private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and\napplied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and\npractices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display\ncontent to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various\nways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could\nadversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated\nbased on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in\nwhich the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition,\nthere have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available\nto online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes\nto our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nthe Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been\nsubjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs as a\nbasis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish\nData Protection Committee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs\nin respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the\nEuropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as\nwell as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its\nprocessing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of\nsuch data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to\nan interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States\nannounced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On\nOctober 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals\nIntelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making\nup the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the\nE.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The\nadequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data\ntransferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy\nFramework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the\nEU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones,\nand we are implementing steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. If we\nare required to take additional steps to comply with the corrective orders, this could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of delivering our products and services in Europe. Furthermore, the EU-U.S. DPF replaces\n10\nTable of Contents\ntwo prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the\nCJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant\nproducts and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or\nnew legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have\nimplemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement\nadditional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our\nlead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still\nevolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In\naddition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing\ndata privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws recently enacted\nby other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. Some\nstates have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under\n18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject\nto interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain\ncohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In addition, the European Union's\nePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely\naffect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans\nto change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from\n\"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for\nno ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding\ncompliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. These or any similar\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions\nand requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services,\nmergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and\nits key requirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA\nhas caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products\nor business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and\nregulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other\njurisdictions could have similar effects. We are also subject to content-related legislation such as the Digital\nServices Act (DSA) in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain\nrestrictions and requirements for our products and services, and subjects us to increased compliance costs. The DSA\nalso includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are\nconsidering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to\nour products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our\nproducts and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or\nregulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in\nlimitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain\njurisdictions.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use and data protection, including with respect to processing\nof sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, safety, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or\notherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the\nfuture be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into\nwith the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and,\n11\nTable of Contents\namong other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and\noversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an\nadministrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of\nthe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission\nAct and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency\nimposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our\nability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries\nor enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial\ncosts, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including\nsubstantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially\nadverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity\nand reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us\nto other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, everything we do is about helping people feel connected and closer, and we are proud of our unique company\nculture.\nWe had a global workforce of 67,317 employees as of December 31, 2023, and we have offices in approximately 90\ncities around the world. We are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are\nfocused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We offer competitive compensation and a\nwide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources, and we work to build a diverse and\ninclusive workplace.\nBeginning in November 2022, we took a number of steps to reduce our expense base. For example, our cost reduction\nefforts have included scaling back budgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and\nemployee layoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a\ngenerous severance package. For U.S. employees, that includes severance of 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional\nweeks for every year of service, payment for all remaining paid time off, restricted stock unit vesting through\ntheir last day on payroll, health insurance, coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families\nfor six months, career services that included three months of career support with an external vendor and early\naccess to unpublished job leads, immigration support that included dedicated immigration specialists to help guide\nemployees based on their needs. We offer similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while\ntaking into account local employment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees\nwith regular performance reviews twice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth\nand career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at Meta. We also offer career development\nopportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we\nutilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning,\nself-service resources, learning communities, and coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta\nand what we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal\nexperience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an\nongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company\nchanges. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive\nchange across the company. In 2024, we expect to update our listening strategy and product capabilities, based on\nfeedback from key groups, to further improve actionability and impact.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. For example, in July\n2023, we announced that our analyses confirm that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and by\nrace in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we continue to provide our employees and their dependents\nwith resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance,\ncommunity, and time away, including family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans,\naccess to legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, and health and well-being benefits.\nOur health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach\ntheir personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health,\ncreate financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community. Programs\nare designed and funded to support needs like autism care, cancer care, transgender services, holistic well-being,\nincluding mental health programs and retirement savings, which represent a few of the ways we support our employees\nand their dependents.\nDiverse and Inclusive Workplace\nWe work to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to\nbuild the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.\nIn our 2023 Responsible Business Practices Report, we published our global diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity\nworkforce data. As of December 31, 2022, our global employee base was composed of 45.4% underrepresented people,\nwith 47.9% underrepresented people in the U.S., and 43.1% of our leaders in the U.S. being people of color. As\npublished in our 2023 Responsible Business Practices Report, people with disabilities now represent 7.2% of our\nU.S. workforce, and based on voluntary self-identification, veterans represented 2.3% and members of the LGBTQ+\ncommunity make up 9.8% of our U.S. workforce.\nWe want our products to work for people around the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to\ndo that. We also remain committed to having a skilled, inclusive and diverse workforce because we believe cognitive\ndiversity fuels innovation. To aid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias from our hiring processes and\nperformance management systems, as well as offering learning and development courses for our employees.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nour ability to compete effectively;\nfluctuations in our financial results;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service, catastrophic events, and crises;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Digital\nMarkets Act (DMA), and Digital Services Act (DSA);\n15\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy, consumer protection, and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents, as well as intentional misuse of our services and other undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Board Chair, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our active user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our\nsuccess. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in\nadding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook\nand Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of\nour active user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved\nhigher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including\ncompetitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and\nservices, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to\nperiod at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to\nFacebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government,\nwhich contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any\nfuture declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and,\nin turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and our competitors introduce new and different products\nand services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n16\nTable of Contents\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European courts invalidating the\nEU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer\nuser data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of changes\nthat we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the GDPR, the\nEuropean Union's ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, U.S. state privacy and youth social media laws including the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Arkansas Social\nMedia Safety Act, Ohio Parental Notification Act, Utah Social Media Regulation Act, or other laws, regulations, or\nregulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or otherwise\nobjectionable content, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the\nsecurity and integrity of our platform;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the\ngeneral public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board\nregarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different\nproducts and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of evolving technologies such\nas generative artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our\ncompetitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;\n17\nTable of Contents\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user\ngrowth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment);\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for\nour users to interact and share on third-party applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order\nto grow revenue.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to\ndo business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a\ncompetitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce\nour ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the\ndemand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the\n18\nTable of Contents\neffectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and\nGoogle;\nadverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to\nadvertising, including developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher\nrate, such as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video\nor messaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to\nthe United States are invalid;\nlimitations on our ability to deliver ads to users under the age of 18 and, in some cases, to continue to offer\ncertain products or services to certain cohorts of users, whether voluntarily, as a result of new laws and\nregulations in the United States and other jurisdictions, or otherwise;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\napplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable content made available\non our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns\nabout brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance\nobligations;\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users consent to or opt out of the use of data for ads,\nincluding as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, DMA, other laws, regulations,\nregulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes (for\nexample, in November 2023, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we began offering our users a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland);\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other\nregions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely\naffected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also can be subject to\nadverse effects from the Israel-Hamas war).\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to\nimpact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do\nnot control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to\nour users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example,\nlegislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, as amended by the CPRA,\nhave impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In\nparticular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe\nfollowing product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have\nintroduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the\nCCPA. Judicial and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other\njurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\"\nto \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative.\nWe are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with\nrequirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and\nuse these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS\ndevelopers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue\nto negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising\nplatforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the\nability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services,\nincluding changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory\nframeworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and\nnegatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by\nmarketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are\nunable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement\ncapabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising\nrevenue.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in\nthe past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our\nability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our\nability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our\nproducts or our delivery of ads have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the usage of our\nproducts and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser\nthat limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users\nand impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads\neffectively, while expanding their own advertising business. In addition, in January 2024, Google began the process\nof phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, Google's,\nor other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads\nand impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our\nproducts work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not\ncontrol, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem\nor in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or\nstandards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile\ndevices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products\nthat do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time,\nwe may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what\nwe believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships\nwith the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other\nbusiness partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated\nlong-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships\nwith such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and\nour business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks,\ntechnologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively\nimpact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely\naffect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer\nhardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant\ninvestments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we recently launched new\nAI features on our products, including conversational AIs, stickers, and editing tools. We continue to incur\nsubstantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging\nproducts to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited\nfashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over\nthe long term. We also recently commenced implementation of end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on\nFacebook and Instagram, which has been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions.\n21\nTable of Contents\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our\nbusiness plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue,\noperating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend\nrelevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features\nfor existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in\ninfrastructure and headcount.\nThere are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of\nAI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or\nprofitability. For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to\nrisks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation (including related to elections), bias,\ndiscrimination, toxicity, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy,\ncybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how various laws related to\nonline services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we\nare subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal\nliability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten\npeople's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various\ngovernmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering\napplying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and data protection laws to AI and/or are\nconsidering general legal frameworks on AI. We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will\napply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to\nthese frameworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adjust our offerings\nin certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and\ntechnologies. Other companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our\ntechnologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of development in the AI\nsector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would\nprevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Further, our ability to\ncontinue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment\nand other physical infrastructure, such as processing hardware and network capacity, as to which we cannot control\nthe availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license\nagreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not\nhave insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such AI technologies. As such,\nwe cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through\nthe dissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or\nmisappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination, cybersecurity attacks, data privacy violations, other\nactivities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to develop competing technologies. While\nwe may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and\nthe inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we\ncannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect\nour business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and\nregulations governing the use of AI may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal\nliability.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our feed display and ranking\nalgorithms or other product features to improve the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the\nfuture have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products, which could\nadversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative\nprominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to\ncontinue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of\npublishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products.\nWe also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products,\nthat attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization,\nsuch as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products,\nfrom time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products\nand services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as\nquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower\nrate than our feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product\nstrategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-\nterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in\ninfrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies,\ndevelopers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our\nexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We\nregularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological\nchallenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited\nexperience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other\ncompanies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development\nefforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop\nproducts that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our\nmetaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these\nefforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of\nour business. In addition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws\nand regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety,\ncompetition, content regulation, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of\nour products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or\notherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not\nbe successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or\nfinancial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users,\nmarketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend\nlargely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may\nnot do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive\nexperience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise\nthrough our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions\nor decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising,\ncompetition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with\nelections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our\nreputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and\nregulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents\nrelating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices,\nas well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in\nMarch 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or\nappropriately to the sharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are\nillegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce our policies, address objectionable\ncontent or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which\ncould erode confidence in our brands.\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate\nto other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or\nservices to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by\nperceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to\ncensor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends,\nincluding, for example, any such actions around geopolitical events or elections in the United States and around\nthe world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board,\nby research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-\nbeing, by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who\nviolate our community standards or terms of service, or by any negative sentiment associated with our management.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not\nbe successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns\naround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being\nissues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial\nresults may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that\nintegrate with our products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications\nthat integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building,\ngrowing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose\nto build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that\nintegrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers\nwith our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that\ncontinues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce\nthe volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the\nuser experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization\nopportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to\nprivacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and\nwe also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some\ninstances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely\naffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we\nare unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create,\nshare, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or\nprospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain\nbusinesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who\nbuild compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and\ndeliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. We also expect to face\nadditional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other\ncompanies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate\nthrough the development and application of new technologies such as AI.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we\nmake updates to our products and services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with\nsafe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user\ndemographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by\nmaking access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our\nusers; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile\ndevice operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google\nhave integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to\niOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure\nads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate\nadvertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we\ncannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\n25\nTable of Contents\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers or advertising agencies or resellers in a\nparticular period;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\n26\nTable of Contents\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our business\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment or abandonment of any assets on our balance sheet, including as a result of\nchanges to our real property lease arrangements and data center assets;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking that prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\nactions;\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection,\nantitrust, content, or AI, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from\n27\nTable of Contents\nacquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of discrete items such as legal\nand tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-\nmarketable equity securities, and in interest rates;\nthe incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, which may impact the other\nfactors described above.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Our reputation has been, and could in the future be,\nadversely affected by unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies,\nproduct decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our\nadvertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products\nor services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of\nservice, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform,\nthe perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the actions of\nother companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media\ncoverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other\ncontent, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics.\nBeginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the\nrelease of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be,\nsubject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable\nuse of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in the United\nStates and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and\nloyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased\nrevenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to\nvarying degrees from time to time.\nWe are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our\nbusiness and operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of public health crises such as pandemics, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions,\nother natural disasters, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, power loss, cyber-\nattacks, and other catastrophic events and crises. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic previously significantly\nimpacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic resulted in authorities implementing\nnumerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel\nbans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders, which caused\nbusiness slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. These developments led to volatility in\nthe demand for and pricing of our advertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may\nexperience similar effects in the future as a result of the pandemic or other catastrophic events. Such events also\nexpose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\n28\nTable of Contents\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments\nin Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the\nfuture as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data\nthey share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new\nand existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue\nto invest in new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to\nfocus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. We have recently undertaken cost reduction measures in\nlight of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business initiatives,\nand some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to\nreduce certain longer-term expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our\nbusiness. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part\nof our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant\ninvestments in Reality Labs, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and\nprofitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2023 overall operating profit by approximately\n$16.12 billion, and we expect our Reality Labs investments and operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024.\nIf our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our products and services could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and\nengagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and services and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and services from time to time. Our\nsystems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid\nperformance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products or services are unavailable\nwhen users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or\nservices as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could\nadversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from\ntime to time. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and\nevolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands\ncontinue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical\ninfrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible\nthat we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these\nincreased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue. In addition, our\nbusiness may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather\nconditions, other natural\n29\nTable of Contents\ndisasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other\ncatastrophic events and crises. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring\nmore frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject to service\ndisruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely\nmanner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and\nmay in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to maintain the availability or performance of\nour products and services in connection with any such events.\nA substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in\nthe services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and\ncould significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely\naffect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to\nproblems with the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various\nchallenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have adjusted,\nand may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape. We may not\nbe able to secure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may\nbe required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or\nservices, require unfavorable changes to existing products or services, delay the introduction of future products\nor services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have experienced, and could experience in the future, difficulties in building and operating key portions of our\ntechnical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\ndeveloping regions that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance, trade compliance, and\npolitical challenges, among others. We have changed, suspended, and terminated certain of these projects as a\nresult of various factors, and may continue to do so in the future. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions\nin the completion of these projects, including due to the availability of components, power, or network capacity,\nor any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required\ngovernment or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result\nof trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in\nthe delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on\nour balance sheet. For example, like others in our industry, we rely on certain third-party equipment and\ncomponents for our technical infrastructure that are manufactured by a small number of third parties, often with\nsignificant operations in a single region such as Asia. Any of the foregoing delays or disruptions, including\nactions by governments or geopolitical events such as international conflicts, could result in tariffs, sanctions,\nexport controls, and other measures that restrict international trade, could reduce or eliminate the ability of our\nsuppliers, manufacturers, or other third-party providers to continue their operations to manufacture, or limit or\neliminate our ability to purchase, key components of our technical infrastructure.\nIn addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases\nof design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying\nequipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical\ninfrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such\ngovernment action, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical\ninfrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to\na negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP))\nand Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data\nbased on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics\n30\nTable of Contents\nrequire significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or\nchanges in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time\nwe discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data\nlimitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do\nnot intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within\nthe error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in\nmeasuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our Family metrics estimates in some instances exceed\nestimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to\nindividual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible\nthat our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for\ncalculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or\nmobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of\nFamily metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals\nor technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that\nmay improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population\nof our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as\ndefined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have\n31\nTable of Contents\nlimited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person\nhas one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as\nwe believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable\ncertain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among\nour users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. Violating accounts are very\ndifficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate\naccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts\nwe look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of\naccess to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the\nstability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our\nmethodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate\na broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it\nis possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. From time to time, we disable certain\nuser accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other\ninquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not\nperceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or\nestimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less\nwilling to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which could negatively\naffect our business and financial results.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.\nOur employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The\nscale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for our management, operational,\nand financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other\nthird parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the\nscale and complexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant\nexperience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage our scale\neffectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial,\nand management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our\npersonnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In\naddition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including\nrestructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to scale down our office facilities, but we cannot guarantee that\nthey will achieve our intended results. These efforts also subject us to risks such as greater than anticipated\ncosts, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased difficulty managing the scale and complexity of our\nbusiness. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and strategic\ninitiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as well as other disruptions to our operations. As our\norganization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt complex organizational management\nstructures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to\nquickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\nWe have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks\nthat could affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages, and we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new\ninternational regions where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our\nproducts are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in\ncertain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally\navailable in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to\ndeploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are\nsubject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\n33\nTable of Contents\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, competition, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and\npandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not\nproperly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products\ndepends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia. We\nhave experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and\nthe supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development,\nand sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary\ncapabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether\ndue to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in\nthe pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of\nour consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments (including international conflicts that could result in\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to\nsupply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety,\nthe environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them\nviolates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or\nstandards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions,\ngovernment action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and\nother factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components\nare ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in\naccurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be difficult to establish\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they\nmay not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023\nfollowing the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority's order directing us to divest Giphy post-\nacquisition. In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after prevailing in\nfederal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of\nsuch acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will\nrealize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on\ninvestment for our strategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in\nincreased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions\nthat would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions\nand we regularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase\nour expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,\ndevelopers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make, substantial investments of resources\nto support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of\nresources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments\nwill be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits\nexpected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced,\ncurrently face, and will continue to face additional class action and other lawsuits based on claims related to\nadvertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related\nto the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and\nunproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our\nplatform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third\nparties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of\n2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former\nemployee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential\naudience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the\nsubject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of facial recognition technology, our alleged\nrecommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our\nbusiness tools, our alleged use of copyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that\nFacebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of violations of the Children's\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages\nor fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework\nunder which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. As of July 2023,\nnearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As\nthis framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate\nimpact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several\ncountries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are\ntaxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to\nchange or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example,\nseveral jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business\nactivities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary,\nsignificantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future\nimpact, our effective tax rate, sometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price\nvaries from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax\nbenefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2023, excess tax benefits\nrecognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $708 million and our effective\nincome tax rate by one percentage point as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in\nwhich our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that\nperiod, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued\nrelative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based\ncompensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not\ncontrol, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect\nour financial results.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results\nof operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr.\nZuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat\nsports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death. If Mr.\nZuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations.\nThe loss of other key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development,\nmarketing, and sales personnel, could also disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In particular, we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring specialized\ntechnical personnel, particularly senior engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other\ncompanies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees\nprovided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue\nsignificant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial\nadditional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price\nvolatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to\nimmigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing\npersonnel . If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and\nmotivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Board Chair, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or\nprevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our\nother stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a\ntransaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential\ninvestor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common\nstock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to\ncontrol the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death,\nthe shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has\ndesignated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in\ngood faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder,\neven a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not\nalways be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases and dividend payments could also increase the volatility of the trading price\nof our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. The specific timing and amount of any share repurchases, and the specific\ntiming and amount of any\n38\nTable of Contents\ndividend payments, will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, company\nperformance, and other considerations. We cannot guarantee that the repurchase program will be fully consummated or\nthat it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase program and dividend payments could affect the\ntrading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this repurchase\nprogram or dividend payments may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this\nrepurchase program and dividend payments will diminish our cash reserves.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nOn February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first-ever quarterly cash dividend. The payment of any cash\ndividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and\nagreements, and our board of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends are in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any\ntime, and there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or\nat all.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides\nauthorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services,\nand if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong is\nalso expected to pass additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect\nto make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security\nLaw or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In addition, in\nconnection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in\nRussia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will\nlikely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising,\nincluding in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we\ngenerate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is possible\nthat the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue,\nwhether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information\nrequests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes\nor other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the\nTurkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise\nadversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is\nsubject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are\nrequired to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our\ncompetitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing\ngeographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our\nuser base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able\nto maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of\nthese laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\nto our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user\ngrowth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services\nto younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property,\nadvertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\ndata disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of\nminors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce,\ntaxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance,\nsecurities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our\nactivities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws,\nregulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition,\nconsumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than\nthose in the United States, and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced\nby private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and\napplied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and\npractices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display\ncontent to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various\nways, including for advertising, could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the\nmanner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing\nsignificant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms\nIreland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective\norders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations\ninto compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the\nUnited States. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay\nfrom the Irish High Court.\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle\non a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive\nOrder on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the\nEuropean Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney\nGeneral as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an\nadequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures\nan adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the\nUnited States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the\nadequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we are implementing steps to comply with the above\ncorrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. If we are required to take additional steps to comply with\nthe corrective orders, this could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in\nEurope. Furthermore, the EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A\nfurther invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create\n40\nTable of Contents\nconsiderable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and\nservices, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or\nnew legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have\nimplemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission\nof personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the\nregulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft\ndecisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the\nGDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As\na result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for\nnon-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact\non our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted\nsimilar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to\nusers in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (CPRA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for\nusers, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to\ncontrol the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted\nsimilar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and\nregulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or\nreductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the\nprivacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy\nlaws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products\nand services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising\nbusiness. In Europe, regulators continue to enforce guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements\nregarding the use of cookies and similar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could\ndirectly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws\nimpose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for\nnon-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have\nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November\n2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage\nwith regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and\nEU consumer laws. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and\nengagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and\nrequirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers\nand acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key\nrequirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA has\ncaused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or\nbusiness practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory\nengagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions\ncould have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which started to apply\nto our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services and\nsubjects us to increased compliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In\naddition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data\nprotection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar\nrequirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering\nour services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in\nfines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use\ninformation about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government\nactions, have led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs,\nloss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational\nharm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business,\nincluding fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use and data protection,\nincluding with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes,\ndata security, minors, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, use of our\nplatform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In\naddition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example,\ndata protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union, United States, and other\njurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in\nwhich we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, we\nhave been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect\nand use information, including where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment,\ncredit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys\ngeneral, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with\nour platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified\nconsent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to\nsignificantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general\ninquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor\nus and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which\nwe are challenging, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection\nAct (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its\ncurrent form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified\nproducts or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy\nregulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and requirements to\nchange our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, we are subject to a\nlawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition\ntechnology.\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business,\nincluding with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other\nthings, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services,\ndigital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in\n2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the FTC and the U.S. Department of\nJustice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws,\nincluding by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against\nour company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or\nreconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement\nof Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes\nEuropean Union competition rules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to\nour business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to\ngovernment investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a\nformer employee.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business\npractices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data\npractices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA,\nthe DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and\nmodifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, reputation, and financial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\nrequirements around the world, such as the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, the Korean\nPersonal Information Protection Act, and the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act. In particular, we are\nmaintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial\nmanagement and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations,\nprohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance\nwith the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party\nassessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance\nand oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually\nreallocate resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an\nadverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to\nour business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming,\nand costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a\ntimely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. Further, our privacy compliance and oversight\nefforts have required, and we expect will continue to require, significant time and attention from our management\nand board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations\nare complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances\nwhere we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to\ncontinue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy\nrequirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For\nexample, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination\nof data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory\nengagement.\nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with\nthe FTC consent order and seeking substantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a\nprohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. We are challenging the\nFTC's administrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order\nin its current form, it would limit our ability to provide certain features and services, engage in certain\nbusiness practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance and\noversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any\nfuture modifications to the order), GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA,\nDSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant authority believes that we are in\nviolation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental\ninvestigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, penalties, or other\nremedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government inquiries relating to information or\ncontent that is published or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations\nrelating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In\nparticular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation\nor news hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights,\nrights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, on-\nor offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of\npharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or\notherwise illegal activity), products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For\nexample, we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on\nallegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we have been subject to\nlitigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.\nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain\njurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear\nor where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019,\nthe European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for\ncopyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which most member states have already\nimplemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media\nService Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. In the United\nStates, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections\navailable to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but\nit ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have been, and continue to be, various\nother litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the\nscope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect\nto commerce listings, user access and content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current\nprotections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial\nor government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany\nand India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to\ncomply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other\ncountries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar\nlegislation imposing liability or potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or\nadvertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have\nbeen subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media\nlegislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-\nrelated legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business\npractices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain\ngeographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain\nauthorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which\nmay require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the\nEuropean Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and\nservices are subject to restrictions and requirements, and we are subject to increased compliance costs, as a\nresult of the Digital Services Act in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023,\nand other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland\nand the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation\nthat may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of\nsuch legislation in Canada, we have removed the availability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and\nInstagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to\nthe U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase our costs or require\nsignificant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth\nand engagement.\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other\nrisks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual,\nand digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send\nmoney to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing\nanti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other\nprepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable\nfundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new\nconsumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments\nactivity as well as sharing, collection, and use of payments-related data. Depending on how our Payments products\nevolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and\nlending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We\nhave received certain payments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions\nfor our regulated Payments-related products and activities. These licenses increase flexibility in how our use of\nPayments may evolve, help mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and will generally require us to demonstrate compliance\nwith many domestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities. Our efforts to\ncomply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and\nmay still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or\nregulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order,\nor we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the\nfuture undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us\nto many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general\nhacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will occur on our systems in\nthe future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or\ntake other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other illegal,\nillicit, or otherwise objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and\nvolume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including\nour efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for\nsuch breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise\nwell-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our\nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such\nbreaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience or otherwise\nadversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal\nsystems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive,\nand to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other\ntechnical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including social engineering or other\ncyber-attacks directed towards our personnel, misuse of company data or systems by our personnel, as well as\ndefects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government surveillance;\nbreaches of physical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats\nthat evolve. In addition, third parties\n45\nTable of Contents\nmay attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data\nor our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult\nto detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect\nour data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities\non our platform, and to reduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute\nsecurity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span numerous\ngeographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and\nother third parties. At any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not\nfully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our security efforts.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe regularly experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur\nsignificant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business\npractices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIntentional misuse of our services and user data and other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intentional misuse of our services and user data by\nthird parties, as well as other undesirable, illicit, or high-risk activity on our platform. We are making\nsignificant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts to combat these activities,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. We have\ndiscovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of\nmisuse of user data or other undesirable or illicit activity by third parties. We will not discover all such\nincidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility\nover our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other projects,\nor other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required\nunder our modified consent order with the FTC, government authorities, the media, or other third parties.\nSuch incidents and activities include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms,\ncontracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper\nadvertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline (such as acts of\nviolence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation,\nchild exploitation, and illegal gaming), instances of spamming, surveillance, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured\ndatasets, or spreading misinformation, or other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity. We may also be\nunsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents.\nConsequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to\nour reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse\neffects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and may in the future subject, us\nto additional litigation\n46\nTable of Contents\nand regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and\nattention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties (including open source software), that is highly technical and\ncomplex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to\nstore, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has\ncontained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain\ntechnical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities\ninherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or\ninternal use. For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that\nexploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information\nfrom user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the\nsoftware and hardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, outcomes including a negative experience or other adverse effects for users and marketers who use our\nproducts, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or\npolicies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised\nability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our\nability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data\nwill be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to\nerrors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition,\nany errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely,\nfailures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or\ninterruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory\ninquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source and other permissive licenses and have\nmade other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open source software in our\nproducts. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our\nAI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions\nand the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or\ninnovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If\nthe protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third\nparties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more\neffectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial results.\n47\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other\nintellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a\nsignificant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which\ncould increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other\nrights holders.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that\ncertain of our products and services, trademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We\npresently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and\ndevelop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow.\nDefending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and\nemployees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition,\nplaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such\nlitigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to change or cease some or all of our\noperations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if\nany litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may\nnot be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or\nall of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to\ncontinue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable\nterms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be\nrequired to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or branding or discontinue the practices or\nbranding. The development of alternative non-infringing technology, branding or practices could require significant\neffort and expense, could result in less effective technology, branding or practices or otherwise negatively affect\nthe user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and\nlitigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2023. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n48\nTable of Contents\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely\naffect our business.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and\ncertain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate\nmatters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of\nour Class B common stock, including our founder, Board Chair, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of\nall outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude\nyour ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our board chair, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n50\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Cybersecurity\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is\nprone to cybersecurity threats and attacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees.\nWe believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence and scale, the types and volume of\npersonal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and\nservices reach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large\namount of data. In addition, our business and operations span numerous geographies around the world, involve\nthousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on software\nand hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of\npolicies and controls designed to mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and\nunknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our\nprogram. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and\nindustry-recognized practices, for managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure,\nand corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats, we evaluate a variety of\ndevelopments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory\nrequirements, and observed cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate\nthe maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes in addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify any\nareas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as\nbenchmarking against industry practices. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess\nprivacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to\nassessment by an independent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent\nassessment and assurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting\ncontrol frameworks. These processes support informed risk-based decision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity\ncountermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of technical\nand operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our\nthird-party assessment (TPA) process. Under our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who\ncontract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with our systems, in order to help us\nassess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among\nother things, maintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of\nmaterial data breaches that may impact our data.\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity\nrisk management oversight to the audit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight\nCommittee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place\ndesigned to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement processes\nand programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy committee of our board\nof directors (Privacy Committee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance\nwith our comprehensive privacy program. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material\ncybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk\nexposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight\nCommittee and Privacy Committee.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Guy Rosen leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across\nthe company supporting our security functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover. These teams are\ncomprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private and public sectors, the technology\nindustry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity,\nsoftware development, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of\nsignificant leadership roles at our company since 2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity\ninitiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022.\n51\nTable of Contents\nPrior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across\ntechnology organizations.\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents\nthrough a variety of technical and operational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the\nsenior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee on the company’s\ncybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.\nIn 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our\nefforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not\nexperienced undetected cybersecurity incidents. For additional information about these risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\n\"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

                "content": "Legal Proceedings\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to\nnumerous claims, litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal\nproceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are\nvigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved\nadversely or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide\nto settle litigation, disputes, or other legal proceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nIn addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or regulatory authorities.\nAny such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability\n(including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or\nrequire us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to\nour products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert\nresources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or\nbehavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the\npast, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of\ncomplex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and\nadvertiser base.\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving\nthe company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are\nfacing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new\nregulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and similar statutes in non-EU\ncountries, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR). We are also responding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing\nor contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users,\nparticularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud,\nunlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people.\n52\nTable of Contents\nThis is in addition to significant tax, antitrust, stockholder, and privacy litigation and investigations.\nFurthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial\ndamages awards and fines has increased.\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have\nnot previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be\nvery difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the applicability and amount\nof any fines or penalties. While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can\nbe no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from claims that\nhave not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United\nStates and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that\nshared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection,\nprivacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the\nparties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by\nus. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion\nand to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys\ngeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19,\n2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was\ndismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ), seeking\nsubstantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and\ninclude, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the\ncomposition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new\nproducts. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v.\nFacebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent\norder. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we have appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding\npending resolution of the appeal. On January 12, 2024, the district court denied our motion for a stay pending\nappeal and, on January 25, 2024, we filed a motion for a stay pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. On\nNovember 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\nMeta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to\npreliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed\nan opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. Oral argument on our\nmotion to enjoin and the FTC's motion to dismiss is scheduled for March 1, 2024. If the FTC proceeding is not\nenjoined or stayed, our response in the proceeding will be due on March 15, 2024, after which time the FTC could\namend the order to impose these additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the\nopportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the\n53\nTable of Contents\nappellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is\nunclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations\nby the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, on\nMay 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard\nContractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in\ncompliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders\nrequiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United\nStates. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the\nIrish High Court. On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United\nStates Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional\ncountries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\" under\nSection 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the\nUnited States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for\npersonal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the\n\"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce\npursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the\nadequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we are implementing steps to comply with the above\ncorrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. For additional information, see Part II, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy,\ndata use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\"\nin this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceedings) could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court ( Texas v. Meta Platforms,\nInc. ) alleging that \"tag suggestions\" and other uses of facial recognition technology violated the Texas Capture\nor Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking\nstatutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in June 2024.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly\nreceived individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our\nterms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re\nMeta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor,\nInc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the California Supreme Court).\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\n2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a\npermanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,\nincluding divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion\nto dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended\ncomplaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been\nfiled in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of\nantitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated\n54\nTable of Contents\nin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On\nJanuary 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions.\nOn March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf\nof certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated\ncomplaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In December 2022, the\nEuropean Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use\ndata in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nOn February 6, 2019, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) issued an antitrust injunction order claiming that our\nterms and policies on data sharing across our apps, and collection from third-party websites via our business\ntools, breached European data protection principles and German competition law. We brought a lawsuit seeking to\ninvalidate the order on February 11, 2019. On March 24, 2021, the Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany\nreferred several questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) including certain questions\nregarding interpretation of the GDPR. On July 4, 2023, the CJEU issued a decision which in particular made it more\ndifficult to rely on \"legitimate interests,\" and \"contractual necessity\" as opposed to user \"consent,\" as a legal\nbasis for data processing under the GDPR for ads and personalization purposes.\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and\ncosts, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management\nfrom our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook,\nInc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and\nuser data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the\nplaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their\ncase, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in\npart and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. Ohio Pub.\nEmpl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages ( Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court\ndismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint.\nYouth-Related Actions\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users, with most\nproceedings focused\n55\nTable of Contents\non those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class actions have been\nfiled in the United States and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school districts,\nmunicipalities and one state in the United States have filed public nuisance claims based on similar allegations.\nOn October 6, 2022, the federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia ( In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation ). On October 13,\n2023, in In re Social Media Cases , the Los Angeles County Superior Court presiding over the California state court\nproceedings sustained in part and overruled in part our demurrer as to the plaintiff's claims. Beginning in October\n2023, additional U.S. states have filed lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These\nadditional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act\n(COPPA) as well as violations of state laws concerning consumer protection, unfair business practices, and products\nliability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices and harms to users under 18 years old. These\nlawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re\nSocial Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country. We are also subject to\ngovernment investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the alleged\nmental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve\nv. Facebook, Inc. ) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and\n2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition\nclaims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21,\n2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district\ncourt's class certification order, and the court heard argument on September 12, 2023. The case is stayed in the\ndistrict court pending appeal.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\n) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al.,\nwhich was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ) alleging\nthat we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear argument in Vivek H. Murthy, Surgeon General,\net al. v. Missouri , et al. , on the question of whether federal government officials violated the First Amendment\nin their communications with the company and others related to content moderation practices, and to hear argument\nin Netchoice, et al. v. Paxton and Moody, et al. v. Netchoice et al. , regarding the application of the First\nAmendment relating to content moderation on tech platforms. Although Meta is not a defendant in these actions, the\nSupreme Court's decision and ultimate resolution of the lawsuit could impact our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal\nproceedings and disputes in the future."

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2023 using 2022 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nOur financial results and key community metrics for 2023 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2023 was\n$134.90 billion, an increase of 16% compared to 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a\nconstant currency basis would have increased 15% compared to 2022. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of\nApps increased 28% year-over-year in 2023, partially offset by a 9% year-over-year decrease in the average price\nper ad.\nIncome from operations for 2023 was $46.75 billion, an increase of $17.81 billion, or 62%, compared to 2022, driven\nby an increase in advertising revenue.\n59\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated and Segment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

As of December 31, 2023, we have completed the data center initiatives and the employee\nlayoffs, and substantially completed the facilities consolidation initiatives.\nA summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2023 by\nmajor activity type is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nFacilities         Severance and Other       Data Center Assets       Total\nConsolidation             Personnel Costs\nCost of revenue        $                   177    $                      —    $                -224    $    -47\nResearch and                             1,581                         413                        —       1,994\ndevelopment\nMarketing and sales                        396                         307                        —         703\nGeneral and                                352                         450                        —         802\nadministrative\nTotal                  $                 2,506    $                  1,170    $                -224    $  3,452\nDuring 2023 and 2022, we recognized total pre-tax restructuring charges of $2.84 billion and $4.10 billion under\nour FoA segment, and $612 million and $515 million under our RL segment, respectively.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding restructuring charges.\nFamily of Apps Metrics\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 3.19 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 8% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.98 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.11 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 3.07 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 28% year-over-year in 2023, and the average price\nper ad decreased by 9% year-over-year in 2023.\nBeginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we will no longer\nreport DAUs, MAUs, ARPU, and MAP in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\nintend to begin reporting year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per\nad by geographic region, while continuing to report DAP and ARPP (calculated based on DAP), beginning with our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024. For additional information, see the\nsection entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDevelopments in Advertising\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on\ntargeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and\nwe expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad\ntargeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\nsystems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including\nits evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive,\nthe European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and\nwe expect these and other\n61\nTable of Contents\ndevelopments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user\ndata practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\"\nand began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with\nregulators on our new consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and\nGoogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and\napplication developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021,\nApple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating\nsystem that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit\nto us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the\nperformance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and\nmeasurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on\nanonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share\ntheir data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More\nbroadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with\nconsumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across\nall of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative\nAI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite\nconversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the\nprivate and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting\nand measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these\nefforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described\nabove will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will\ncontinue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe\nadvertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and\nrelated market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which\ncould impact our financial results in future periods. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced\nsome users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our\nproducts, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen\nresults in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes\nat a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for\nthe foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or\nmore regions from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and\nInstagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued\nto adversely affect user growth and engagement in 2023. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in\n2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have\nperfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex\njudgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the\nglobe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to\nidentify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to\nquantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.\n62\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several\nefforts to increase our operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant\nopportunities. In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 20% were recognized in RL.\nOur FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of\nour efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI\ninitiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop\nnew products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and\nmixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for\nthe metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of\nour RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the\nmetaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. In 2023, our RL segment reduced our overall operating\nprofit by approximately $16.12 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. We\nexpect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts\nis dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we\nbelieve this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses,\ndevelopers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n63\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\nSubstantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile\ndevices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n------ DAP/MAP: ------ 79% ------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% --------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% --------\n79% -------- 80%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family\nmetrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\nWorldwide DAP increased 8% to 3.19 billion on average during December 2023 from 2.96 billion during December 2022.\n64\nTable of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP.

For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family\nmetrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 3.98 billion MAP, an increase of 6% from 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022.\n65\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $9.39    $7.72         $7.91    $7.53    $8.63             $7.59    $8.32    $8.71    $10.10\nAd Revenue                      Non-Ad Revenue\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using\nour Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources. Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we intend to report ARPP based on DAP instead of MAP.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $34.72, an\nincrease of 9% from 2022.\n66\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of\nour daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\n----\nDAU/MAU: -- 66% ------ 67% ------ 67% ------ 67% ------ 67% ------ 68% ------ 68% ----- 68% ------ 69% -\n- -\nDAU/MAU: -- 74% ----- 75% ------ 75% ------ 74% ------ 75% ----- 74% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ---- DAU/MAU:\n- 72% ------ 73% ------ 74% ----- 74% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ---\n- -\nDAU/MAU: -- 63% ----- 64% ------ 64% ------ 64% ------ 65% ----- 66% ------ 66% ------ 66% ------ 67% ---- DAU/MAU:\n- 65% ------ 66% ------ 66% ----- 66% ------ 66% ------ 67% ------ 66% ------ 67% ------ 67% ---\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n67\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 6% to 2.11 billion on aver age during December 2023 from 2.00 billion during December 2022\n. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December\n2023, relative to the same period in 2022.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 3.07 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from December 31, 2022. Users in India,\nBangladesh, and Nigeria represented the top three sources of growth in 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.\n68\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nWhile the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate\nthat revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total\nrevenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our\nFamily products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize\nusers in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &\nCanada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile\nadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2023 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher\nthan in the Asia-Pacific region.\n--- ARPU: -- $11.57 --- $9.54 --- $9.82 --- $9.41 --- $10.86 ---- $9.62 ---- $10.63 ---- $11.23 --- $13.12 -\n-\n-- ARPU: -- $60.57 -- $48.29 -- $50.25 -- $49.13 --- $58.77 -- $48.85 --- $53.53 --- $56.11 --- $68.44 --------\nARPU: -- $19.68 -- $15.35 -- $15.64 -- $14.23 -- $17.29 --- $15.51 -- $17.88 --- $19.04 --- $23.14\n- ARPU: -- $4.89 ---- $4.47 ---- $4.54 ---- $4.42 ---- $4.61 ---- $4.52 ---- $4.88 ----- $5.12 ---- $5.52 -------\nARPU: -- $3.43 ----- $3.14 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.21 ---- $3.52 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.76 ----- $4.22 ---- $4.50\nAd Revenue    Non-Ad Revenue\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using\nour Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\n69\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $44.60, an\nincrease of 13% from 2022. For 2023, ARPU increased by 21% in Europe, 20% in Rest of World, 11% in Asia-Pacific,\nand 10% in United States & Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as\nAsia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those\nregions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative\nto ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each\ngeographic region.\n70\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting\nestimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material\ndue to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes\nof the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the\nestimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when\napplicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider\nthese to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting\npolicies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions\nare finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other\nfactors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\nrevised in future quarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12 — Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 15 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income\n(loss) before\n71\nTable of Contents\nprovision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required\nin determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation\ncorroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that\nwe have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide\nno assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment\nis required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment\nand assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and\ncompanies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets,\noccurs whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable\ncompared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual\ndisposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the\ncarrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair\nvalue.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for\nusing the measurement alternative, is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering\nevents for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's\nfinancial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological\nenvironment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the\nmarket approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income\nif the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity\nsecurities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-\nmarketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations\nassociated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion\nfeatures, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and\nobligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. The identification of\nobservable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment\nfor these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\n72\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad\nproducts either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number\nof impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are\nnot currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or\ndecrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate\naverage price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average\nprice paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising\nrevenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from\ndevelopers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related\nsoftware and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our\nproducts. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related\nexpenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist\nof cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist mostly of payroll and related expenses which\ninclude share-based compensation, RL technology development costs, facilities-related costs for employees on our\nengineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing\nproducts, and restructuring charges.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mainly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales\nsupport, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also\ninclude professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations and\nrestructuring charges.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal-related costs, which\ninclude estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as\nother legal fees; payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives\nas well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative\nemployees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; professional services\nand restructuring charges.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022.

The increase was almost entirely driven by\nadvertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2023 increased $18.31 billion, or 16%, compared to 2022 due to an increase in the number of\nads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad. In 2023, the number of ads delivered\nincreased by 28%, as compared with an 18% increase in 2022 as ads impressions grew in all regions during 2023,\nespecially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads delivered during 2023 was driven by increases\nin the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. In 2023, the average\nprice per ad decreased by 9%, as compared with a decrease of 16% in 2022. The decrease in average price per ad was\ndriven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels,\nthat monetize at lower rates. While the average price per ad declined year-over-year, we believe the improvements\nto our ad targeting and measurement tools have had a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand.\nOther factors are also discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results.\" In\naddition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth for the full year 2023 was driven mainly by marketer spending\nin online commerce, which benefited from marketers based in China, consumer packaged goods, and entertainment and\nmedia. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads\ndelivered.\nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2023 increased $250 million, or 31%, compared to 2022. The increase was mainly driven by\nWhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2023 decreased $263 million, or 12%, compared to 2022. The decrease in RL revenue was mostly driven\nby a net decrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 17%, 16%, and\n16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021 declined 11%, 17%, and 7% compared to the fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020\nrespectively.\n75\nTable of Contents\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nChanges in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue in the full year 2023 compared to the\nsame period in 2022. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange\nrates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising\nrevenue would have been $134.53 billion and $131.57 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total\nrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $374 million and $379 million lower than actual total revenue and\nadvertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2023. Using the same constant rates, full year 2023 total\nrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $17.92 billion and $17.93 billion higher than actual total revenue\nand advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                       2023 vs 2022 %       2022 vs 2021 %\n2023            2022            2021               change               change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nCost of          $          25,959       $  25,249       $  22,649                    3  %                11  %\nrevenue\nPercentage of                   19  %           22  %           19  %\nrevenue\nCost of revenue in 2023 increased $710 million, or 3%, compared to 2022.

This was partially offset by a decrease in the proportion of\nU.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income relative to income before provision for income taxes and\nadditional clarification issued by the IRS in September 2023 regarding research and development expenses subject to\nmandatory capitalization and amortization.\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not\nexpected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our\nbusiness, and the effects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 26,\n2024 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be\nin the mid-teens. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and\ndevelopment expenses incurred in 2023, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory\ncapitalization requirement increased our 2023 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax\nrate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is\ndeferred, our effective tax rate in 2024 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities\ncould be lower.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits . As of December 31, 2023, we had net uncertain tax positions of $6.95 billion which were\naccrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related\nto transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing\nservices and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax\ncredits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or\nevents that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described\nbelow and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such\namounts within the next 12 months.\nSee Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\n78\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from\noperations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time\ndeposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt\nsecurities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions\nand our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable\nsecurities were $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $24.67 billion from December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was mostly due to $71.11 billion of cash generated from operations, and $8.46 billion of net proceeds from\nthe issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in May 2023. These increases were partially offset by\n$28.10 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $19.77 billion for\nrepurchases of our Class A common stock, and $7.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of\nemployee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   71,113    $   50,475    $   57,683\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                  -24,495    $  -28,970    $   -7,570\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -19,500    $  -22,136    $  -50,728\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $39.10 billion net income adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, such as $14.03 billion of share-based compensation expense and $11.18 billion of\ndepreciation and amortization expense, as well as $3.29 billion of favorable changes in working capital. The\nincrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly du e to an increase in\ncash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, and a decrease in payments to our vendors.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $27.05 billion of net purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.20\nbillion net proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities. The decrease in cash used in\ninvesting activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly due to a decrease in purchases of property and\nequipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $37 billion in 2024.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $19.77 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $7.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $8.46\nbillion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities\nduring 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock,\npartially offset by an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee RSU awards and a decrease\nin net proceeds from our debt offerings.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\n79\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nNet cash provided by operating              $                   71,113    $   50,475    $   57,683\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment, net                       -27,045       -31,186       -18,567\nPrincipal payments on finance leases                            -1,058          -850          -677\nFree cash flow                              $                   43,010    $   18,439    $   38,439\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be\nsufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchases and dividend payments for at least the\nnext 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital\nresources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include offices, data centers, and colocations. Our finance lease\nobligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not\nmaterially change our operating lease obligations.\nOur contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and\nconsumer hardware products in Reality Labs.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $18.50 billion. These notes were issued in multiple series, which mature from 2027 through\n2063. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of December 31, 2023 are $848 million and\n$16.40 billion, respectively. Net proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, which may\ninclude, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or\ninvestments.\n80\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 92 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $20.03 billion, which includes the 1% excise tax\naccruals as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $30.93 billion remained\navailable and authorized for repurchases. In January 2024, an additional $50 billion of repurchases was authorized\nunder this program.\nDividend\nOn February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. This cash dividend of\n$0.50 per share of common stock is equivalent to $2.00 per share on an annual basis. The first cash dividend will\nbe paid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2024.\nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to\ncontinue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The\ndeclaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into\naccount various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and\nanticipated cash needs.\nTaxes\nCash paid for income taxes was $6.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had\ntaxes payable of $1.14 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of\nwhich $575 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual\ninterest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $6.95 billion related to the uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2023. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the\ntiming of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate\nof the timing of payments.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, Note 13 — Stockholders'\nEquity, and Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item\n8, and \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation regarding leases and contractual commitments, debt, taxes, and contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n81\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\nprice risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to remeasuring monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other\nthan the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into,\nbut in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $366 million, $81 million, and $140 million were recognized in\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash\nequivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements.\nChanges in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nand the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would\nhave resulted in a decrease of $355 million and $558 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt\nsecurities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Any realized gains or losses\nresulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we\nsold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes)\noutstanding of $18.50 billion and $10.00 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and\nare carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing\nin periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\n82\nTable of Contents\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments are in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price risks that could\nhave a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available\nmarket data and observable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could\nadversely impact the valuation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or\ndownward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities, which mostly consists of our\ninvestment in Jio Platforms Limited, had a carrying value of $6.14 billion and $6.20 billion as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Financial\nInstruments, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities, and Note 10 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and\nPart II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical\nAccounting Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n83\nTable of Contents"

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n85\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nloss contingencies was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments\nof the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential\namount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nOur audit procedures included reading the minutes or a summary of\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, reading\nthe proceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries\nand investigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate,\nrequesting and receiving internal and external legal counsel\nconfirmation letters, meeting with internal and external legal\ncounsel to discuss the nature of the various matters, and obtaining\nrepresentations from management. We also evaluated the\nappropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 12 to\nthe consolidated financial statements.\n86\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions.

In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the\nCompany) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2024\n88\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring\nthe world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the\nmetaverse to life.\nWe report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to loss contingencies,\nincome taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS)\ndebt securities and accounts receivable, and fair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are\nbased on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and expectations about actions\nwe may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers .\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is\none year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We\ndo not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of\none year or less.\nRevenue includes sales and usage‑based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\nmobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising\n95\nTable of Contents\nrevenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our\ncontrol is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our\ncustomers.\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and\nreport revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider\nif we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as\nother indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related\nsoftware and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which\nis generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in\nexchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our\nPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These\nmainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost\nof revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit\ncard and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of\nproducts sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee,\nor both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if\nthe capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not\nmaterial to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners\nbased on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Expensed content costs\nare included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for\ncapitalization were not material to date.\n96\nTable of Contents\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.02billion, $ 2.65billion, and $ 2.99billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nEmployee Severance\nWe recognize one-time employee termination costs when notification occurs, based on the regional requirements in\nwhich the employee works.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid\ninvestments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We classify amounts in transit from\ncustomer credit cards and payment service providers as cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-\nsale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current\noperations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of\ntaxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with\nan amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a\ncharge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining\nunrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders'\nequity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were not\nmaterial. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific\n97\nTable of Contents\nidentification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting primarily of cash related to insurance policies, and\nretention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and\nother assets on our consolidated balance sheets based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. We\nperiodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated\nfair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we write down the investment to fair value. The change in\ncarrying value, if any, gains and losses resulting from the remeasurements are recognized in interest and other\nincome (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.For additional information, see Note 6 — Non-\nmarketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy because their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models\nutilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to\ndevelop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on\na non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions\noccur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and\n98\nTable of Contents\nallowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience,\nthe age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability\nto collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our\nconsolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowances for accounts receivable were\nimmaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the\nremaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets are described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           FourtoFive years\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. Additionally, we recorded abandonment charges and its\nrelated adjustments in 2023 and 2022 for data center construction in progress (CIP) assets under ASC Topic 360\nrelated to our restructuring efforts. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 —\nRestructuring.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining\ncarrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated\nuseful life.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within CIP are not depreciated. CIP is related to the construction or\ndevelopment of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We\ncapitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the\nrelated assets.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale\nor disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain offices, data centers, and colocations. We also have finance leases\nfor certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases\ncontain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities,\nreal estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a\nsingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common\narea maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price\nIndex, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and\nutilities. Such variable lease costs are\n99\nTable of Contents\nexpensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we\napply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease\nterm unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any\nmaterial residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 , we recorded net impairment losses of $ 2.43billion and $\n2.22billion in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of\nour facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The\nassumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future\nsubleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of\nrisk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts,\nsee Note 3 — Restructuring.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\nrecord such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and disclose the\npossible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair\nvalue of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as\ngoodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase\nconsideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived\nintangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\n100\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units subject to goodwill\nimpairment testing. As of December 31, 2023, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not\nrecoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We\nhave not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax of $ 1.24billion and $ 1.86billion,\nrespectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 366million, $\n81million, and $ 140million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly\nof money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities\nconsist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\ncorporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large\nfinancial institutions and our marketable securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our\ninvestment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The\namount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 was not material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 37%, 40%, and 41% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with a majority of the\nrevenue outside of the United States in 2023 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil,\nAustralia, Canada and Japan.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\n101\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn April 1, 2023 we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control\nArrangements (ASU 2023-01), which requires leasehold improvements associated with common control leases to be\namortized over the useful life to the common control group. The adoption of this new standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires an enhanced disclosure of\nsignificant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for the annual periods\nbeginning the year ended December 31, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is\npermitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the\nfinancial statements. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n(ASU 2023-09), which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and\ngreater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated\nby jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures.\nThis guidance will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. Early adoption\nis permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the\nadoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n102\nTable of Contents\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nAdvertising       $                  131,948    $  113,642    $  114,934\nOther revenue                          1,058           808           721\nFamily of Apps                       133,006       114,450       115,655\nReality Labs                           1,896         2,159         2,274\nTotal revenue     $                  134,902    $  116,609    $  117,929\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers, consists of the following (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nUnited States and Canada(1)    $                   52,888    $   50,150    $   51,541\nEurope(3)                                          31,210        26,681        29,057\nAsia-Pacific(2)                                    36,154        27,760        26,739\nRest of World(3)                                   14,650        12,018        10,592\nTotal revenue                  $                  134,902    $  116,609    $  117,929\n_________________________\n(1) United States revenue was $ 49.78billion, $ 47.20billion, and $ 48.38billion for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n(2) China revenue was $ 13.69billion, $ 7.40billion, and $ 7.59billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\n(3) Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\nOur total deferred revenue was $ 675million and $ 526million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Impacted\nemployees in our recruiting, technology, and business groups were notified during March 2023 to May 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have completed these employee layoffs. In certain regions, a small portion of the impacted\nemployees continue to be included in our reported headcount through 2024.

As the\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings\nare allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of\ndilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under our Equity Incentive Plan.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the\nweighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 16million and 95million shares of Class A common\nstock equivalents of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would\nhave an anti-dilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2023                     2022                     2021\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,722    $  5,376    $  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,220         354        2,285         402        2,383         432\nearnings per share\nBasic EPS               $                   15.19    $  15.19    $    8.63    $   8.63    $   13.99    $  13.99\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,722    $  5,376    $  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            5,376           —        3,471           —        6,042           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —        -112            —         -19            —         -93\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  39,098    $  5,264    $  23,200    $  3,452    $  39,370    $  5,949\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,220         354        2,285         402        2,383         432\nearnings per share\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           354           —          402           —          432           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive                             55           —           15           —           44           —\nRSUs\nShares used in\ncomputation of                              2,629         354        2,702         402        2,859         432\ndiluted\nearnings per share\nDiluted EPS             $                   14.87    $  14.87    $    8.59    $   8.59    $   13.77    $  13.77\n106\nTable of Contents\nNote 5.\nFinancial Instruments\nInstruments Measured at Fair Value\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted\nmarket prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair\nvalue.

Using the expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend related to our renewable energy\nagreements as of December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 15.12billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years.\nThe ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on actual volume purchased.\n115\nTable of Contents\nLegal and Related Matters\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described below, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described below that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be\nuncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to\ncomply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these\nother legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and investigations, and other matters,\nasserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we\nbelieve a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of\nlosses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually\nor in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15 — Income Taxes.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United\nStates and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that\nshared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection,\nprivacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the\nparties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $ 725million by\nus. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified\nconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain\nof our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders\nfiled an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary\nduty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and\nconsolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc.\nDerivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10,\n2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was\ndenied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims.\n116\nTable of Contents\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking\nsubstantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and\ninclude, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the\ncomposition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new\nproducts. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v.\nFacebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent\norder. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we have appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding\npending resolution of the appeal. On January 12, 2024, the district court denied our motion for a stay pending\nappeal and, on January 25, 2024, we filed a motion for a stay pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. On\nNovember 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\nMeta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to\npreliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed\nan opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. Oral argument on our\nmotion to enjoin and the FTC’s motion to dismiss is scheduled for March 1, 2024. If the FTC proceeding is not\nenjoined or stayed, our response in the proceeding will be due on March 15, 2024, after which time the FTC could\namend the order to impose these additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the\nopportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the\nenforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the\nrequest for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta\nPlatforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €\n1.2billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I,\nItem 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are\nsubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's cooperation and consistency\nmechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance,\nare subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have\naccrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be\nmaterial individually or in the aggregate.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court ( Texas v. Meta Platforms,\nInc. ) alleging that \"tag suggestions\" and other uses of facial recognition technology violated the Texas Capture\nor Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking\nstatutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in June 2024.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly\nreceived individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our\nterms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re\nMeta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor,\nInc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the California Supreme Court).\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\n2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC, and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of\n117\nTable of Contents\nthe Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on\naccess to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the\nantitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On\nJune 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On\nAugust 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this\namended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint.\nMultiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the\nUnited Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these\nacquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of\nthe cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On January 14,\n2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1,\n2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain\nadvertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint\nfiled in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In December 2022, the European\nCommission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a\nmanner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook,\nInc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and\nuser data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the\nplaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their\ncase, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in\npart and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. Ohio Pub.\nEmpl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages ( Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court\ndismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint.\nYouth-Related Actions\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users, with most\nproceedings focused on those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class\nactions have been filed in the United States and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous\nschool districts, municipalities, and onestate in the United States have filed public nuisance claims based on\nsimilar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( In re Social Media Adolescent\n118\nTable of Contents\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation ). On October 13, 2023, in In re Social Media Cases , the\nLos Angeles County Superior Court presiding over the California state court proceedings sustained in part and\noverruled in part our demurrer as to the plaintiff's claims. Beginning in October 2023, additional U.S. states have\nfiled lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations\nregarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) as well as violations of state laws\nconcerning consumer protection, unfair business practices, and products liability, with proceedings focused on our\nalleged business practices and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive\nrelief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as\nwell as various state courts around the country. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from\nmultiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety\nimpacts on users, particularly younger users.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve\nv. Facebook, Inc. ) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and\n2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition\nclaims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21,\n2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district\ncourt's class certification order, and the court heard argument on September 12, 2023. The case is stayed in the\ndistrict court pending appeal.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\n) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al.)\n, which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) alleging\nthat we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2023, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability\nfor costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2023.\n119\nTable of Contents\nNote 13.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. The holder of each\nshare of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is\nentitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our\nClass A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial\nstatements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 2,211million shares of Class A common stock and 350million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, $ 10.87billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2023, an additional $ 40billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program. In 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 92million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for an aggregate amount of $ 20.03billion, which includes the 1% excise tax accruals as a result of\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $ 30.93billion remained available and authorized for\nrepurchases. In January 2024, an additional $ 50billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDividend\nOn February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. This cash dividend of $\n0.50per share of common stock is equivalent to $ 2.00per share on an annual basis. The first cash dividend will be\npaid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2024.\nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to\ncontinue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future\ndividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including\nour financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.\nShare-based Compensation Plan\nWe have oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which\nwas amended in each of June 2016, February 2018, and December 2022. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance\nof incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance\nshares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in\nconnection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\nOn March 1, 2023, the number of shares available for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan increased by 425million\nshares pursuant to the December 2022 amendment. As of December 31, 2023, there were 494million shares of our Class\nA common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan.\n120\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our share-based compensation expense, which consists of the RSU expense, by line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023         2022        2021\nCost of revenue                           $                      740    $     768    $    577\nResearch and development                                      11,429        9,361       7,106\nMarketing and sales                                              952        1,004         837\nGeneral and administrative                                       906          859         644\nTotal share-based compensation expense    $                   14,027    $  11,992    $  9,164\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)                                    Per Share\nUnvested at December 31, 2022             127,110    $                                  216.93\nGranted                                   112,066    $                                  202.46\nVested                                    -65,402    $                                  210.74\nForfeited                                 -24,712    $                                  210.39\nUnvested at December 31, 2023             149,062    $                                  209.85\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n195.66and $ 305.40, respectively.

We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 490million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 4.08billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock\nownership change of greater than 50% over a three‑yearperiod.\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023         2022        2021\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑           $                   10,757    $   9,807    $  8,692\nbeginning of period\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                168          210         328\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                               -264         -172         -86\npositions\nIncreases related to current year tax                            1,204        1,166         963\npositions\nDecreases related to settlements of                               -199         -254         -90\nprior year tax positions\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of    $                   11,666    $  10,757    $  9,807\nperiod\n123\nTable of Contents\nThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our\nforeign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions,\nas well as for the uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all years presented, we recognized interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated\nstatements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $\n1.48billion, $ 1.07billion, and $ 960million respectively.\nIf our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 11.67billion as of December 31, 2023 were realized in a future period,\nthis would result in a tax benefit of $ 7.33billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax years. Our 2014 through 2016 tax\nyears are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in\nAugust 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe\nthat, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed\nU.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2023, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional\ntax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n124\nTable of Contents\nNote 16.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs."

Our\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers,\nvirtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, augmented reality (AR), and wearables. We also help people\ndiscover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences,\nideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to\nthe public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond\n2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing\nplatform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices,\nand new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become\nthe next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help\nmake our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products\nand services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends\nrelevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences,\nand the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant\nthat's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn,\nget things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is\nreflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such\nas generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of\nconsumer hardware products, software, and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment\nareas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and\nservices, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity.\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs\nand expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024\nand include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and\nwearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social\nplatforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in\n2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are\nfundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many\nproducts may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how\nthe next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the\nforeseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the next computing platform is dependent on\ngenerating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and\nlong-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will\nunlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware,\nand digital goods.\n6\nTable of Contents\nFamily of Apps Products\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to people with shared interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels,\nStories, Groups, Marketplace, and more.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nLive, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video,\nand private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ncommunities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.\nThreads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come\ntogether to discuss topics of interest. People can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who\nlove the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their ideas, opinions, and creativity with\nthe world.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a\none-to-many broadcast service designed to help people follow information from people and organizations that are\nimportant to them.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for\nproducts that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes\nexploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their\ndevices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation\ninterfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse and wearables products and experiences\nthat help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nOur metaverse efforts include our VR, MR, and social platform initiatives. Our current product offerings in VR\ninclude our Meta Quest devices, as well as software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which\nenable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while engaging in gaming, fitness,\nentertainment, and more. To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have introduced MR capabilities, which\nallow users to experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world,\nthrough our Meta Quest devices.\nOur wearables efforts include our AR initiatives. We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional\nAI-enabled offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational\nassistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction. As we continue our long-term efforts to bring\nAR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content\non top of the physical world. It does this with an industry-leading field of view and in glasses form factor for\ncomfortable wear.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the next computing\nplatform, our metaverse efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and\nservices to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and\ndevelopment projects. For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating\nexpenses on our wearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives. We apply significant\njudgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our\nexpectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies evolve. In\nparticular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the\ntechnological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\n7\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and\ndiscover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We\ncompete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our\nfree or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer\nhardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to face additional\ncompetition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies\nintroduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and\napplication of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video, VR, and MR\nincreases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have\ndesigned and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion\nof our technical infrastructure is also provided by third parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate\nour products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network capacity.\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new\nones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and\nintegrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse.\nAcross all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to,\namong other things, recommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance\nour advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new\nproducts as well as new features for existing products.\nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-\nthe-art foundation models that are available for researchers and developers to use and build upon. By making our\nLlama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and development, improve our own products, and to\nfoster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence.\nWe also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers,\nresellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel, Meta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and\nenterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data combination,\ndata protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption,\nrights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data\nsecurity, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and machine learning,\nelectronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil\nrights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade\ncontrols including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online\npayment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other\nactions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition,\nthese U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the\npotential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced\nby private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and\napplied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and\npractices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display\ncontent to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various\nways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in\nthe past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide\nour services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly\nmay be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral\nargument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its\ndecision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and\nfederal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online\nplatforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our\nproducts, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nin 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European\nUnion to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the\nCourt of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such\ndata, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the\nUnited States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU\nupheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta\nPlatforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user\ndata was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an\nadministrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend\nthe relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the\nunlawful processing, including storage,\n9\nTable of Contents\nof such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim\nstay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that\nthey had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7,\n2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence\nActivities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA\nwere designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On\nJuly 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy\ndecision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred\nfrom the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework\nList,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S.\nDPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we\nhave implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S.\nDPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the\nEU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our\nmost significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or\nnew legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have\nimplemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement\nadditional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our\nlead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still\nevolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European\nprivacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where\nthey believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-\ncompliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on\nour business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted\nsimilar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to\nusers in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy\nRights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users,\nincluding limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control\nthe purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar\ncomprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and\nregulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or\nreductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the\nprivacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy\nlaws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products\nand services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising\nbusiness. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies\nand similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly\nimpact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose\nadditional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-\ncompliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have\nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\"\nto \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative.\nWe are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the\nGDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened\nformal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA,\nand it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply\nwith such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the\nEuropean Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European\nconsumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In\nresponse to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic\nArea, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see\nless personalized ads,\n10\nTable of Contents\nwhich are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and\nrequirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers\nand acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key\nrequirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may\nin the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business\npractices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory\nengagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar\neffects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes\ncertain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as\nwell as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In\naddition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation\nimplementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing\nof data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and\ncomplexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain\ncountries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our\nability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas,\nUtah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to\nminors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement\nof a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is\npossible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and\ncertain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more\nof these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective\neffective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social\nmedia ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social\nmedia companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative\nproposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also\nsubject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our\nplatform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business\npractices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third\nparties in such transactions.\nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data protection, including with\nrespect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security,\nminors, data subject rights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content\nmoderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and\nmachine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees,\nincluding the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took\neffect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for\nprivacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent\norder and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal\ncourt, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),\nthe COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are\nunsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we\nwould be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use\ndata of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or\nregulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability\n(including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or\nrequire us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to\nour products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business.\n11\nTable of Contents\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, everything we do is about helping people feel connected and closer, and we are proud of our unique company\nculture.\nWe had a global workforce of 74,067 employees as of December 31, 2024, and we have offices in more than 90 cities\naround the world. We are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are focused on\nsupporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We offer competitive compensation and a wide range\nof benefits, including many learning and development resources.\nFrom time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and\nstrategic priorities. For example, we have previously undertaken cost reduction efforts such as scaling back\nbudgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and employee layoffs and restructurings. We\nmake it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S.\nemployees, that includes severance payments, payment for all remaining paid time off, and restricted stock unit\nvesting through their last day on payroll, as well as certain continuing coverage of the cost of healthcare for\nemployees and their families, career services with an external vendor, and immigration support. We offer similar\nsupport for outgoing employees outside of the United States while taking into account local employment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees\nwith regular performance reviews twice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth\nand career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at Meta. We also offer career development\nopportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we\nutilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning,\nself-service resources, learning communities, and coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta\nand what we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal\nexperience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an\nongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company\nchanges. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive\nchange across the company.\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. For example, in September\n2024, we announced that we continue to have pay equity for gender globally and ethnicity in the United States.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we continue to provide our employees and their dependents\nwith resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance,\ncommunity,\n12\nTable of Contents\nand time away, including family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans, access to legal\nservices, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, and health and well-being benefits.\nOur health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach\ntheir personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health,\ncreate financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community.\nThe Strength of Our Workforce and People Processes\nIn early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape.\nWe will continue to work to build an inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity\nto build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.\nWe want our products to work for people around the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to\ndo that. We remain committed to having a skilled, inclusive and diverse workforce with a broad range of knowledge,\nskills, political views, backgrounds, and perspectives because we believe cognitive diversity fuels innovation. To\naid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias in our people processes and tooling, including our hiring\nprocesses and performance management systems.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nour ability to compete effectively;\nfluctuations in our financial results;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service, catastrophic events, and crises;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell or deliver advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use, data combination, data protection, content and content\nmoderation, competition, youth, safety, consumer protection, advertising, and other laws and regulations, including\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Digital Markets Act (DMA), Digital Services Act (DSA), Artificial\nIntelligence Act (EU AI Act), and the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act (DMCC);\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy, consumer protection, and competition authorities, among others;\n14\nTable of Contents\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents, as well as intentional misuse of our services and other undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our active user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our\nsuccess. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in\nadding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook\nand Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of\nour active user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved\nhigher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including\ncompetitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and\nservices, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to\nperiod at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to\nFacebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government,\nwhich contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any\nfuture declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and,\nin turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and our competitors introduce new and different products\nand services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n15\nTable of Contents\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European courts invalidating the\nEU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer\nuser data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, decreased efficiency of our advertising products, or failure to\naccept our terms of service, as part of changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether\nvoluntarily, in connection with the GDPR, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, the DMCC, U.S.\nstate privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act\n(CCPA), youth social media laws, or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or otherwise\nobjectionable content, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the\nsecurity and integrity of our platform;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that result in our removal of users from our platform or\nare perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations\nfrom the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different\nproducts and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of evolving technologies such\nas generative artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our\ncompetitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user\ngrowth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment);\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\n16\nTable of Contents\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for\nour users to interact and share on third-party applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order\nto grow revenue.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to\ndo business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a\ncompetitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce\nour ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the\ndemand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nadverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to\nadvertising, including developments that may impact certain advertisers' ability to advertise on our platform or\nour ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher\nrate, such as our Feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video\nor messaging products;\nreductions of advertising due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the\nsecurity and integrity of our platform or that we believe are needed to comply with global content, security, or\nintegrity obligations;\n17\nTable of Contents\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to\nthe United States are invalid;\nlimitations on our ability to deliver ads to users under the age of 18 and, in some cases, to continue to offer\ncertain products or services to certain cohorts of users, whether voluntarily, as a result of new laws,\nregulations, or government actions in the United States and other jurisdictions, or otherwise;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\napplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable content made available\non our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns\nabout brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding regulatory developments or their own\nlegal and compliance obligations, including with respect to artificial intelligence;\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users consent to, opt out of, or reduce the use of data\nfor ads, including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the\nfuture in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DMCC, U.S. state privacy laws including the CCPA, and\nother laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for\nadvertising purposes (for example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we began offering our users a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland, and\nsubsequently in November 2024 provided users in those regions who elect to continue receiving our services free-of-\ncharge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads);\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other\nregions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely\naffected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also can be subject to\nadverse effects from conflicts in the Middle East or the implementation of tariffs by the United States, China, or\nother governments).\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future, including our enforcement efforts, could result in a\nreduction in marketer spend or demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, could cause\nmarketers to stop advertising with us altogether, or could otherwise negatively affect our revenue and financial\nresults, and could be material.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to\nimpact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do\nnot control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to\nour users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example,\nlegislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws,\nincluding the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad\nproducts. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad\ntargeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive\ncompliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California\nfollowing adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the\nColorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could\nresult in restrictions on our use of signals from third-party apps and websites through certain browser- and\ndevice-based universal opt-out mechanisms. Judicial and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or\nnew legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the\nfuture that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in\nresponse to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral\nadvertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from\n\"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for\nno ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with\nrequirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened\nformal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA,\nand it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an\nopinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised\nconcerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November\n2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue\nusing our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to\nbe less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and\nuse these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS\ndevelopers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue\nto negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising\nplatforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the\nability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services,\nincluding changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory\nframeworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and\nnegatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by\nmarketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are\nunable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement\ncapabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising\nrevenue.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in\nthe past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our\nability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to\n19\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees\nrelated to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads have adversely affected, and could in the future\nadversely affect, the usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously\nreleased an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to\nprovide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit\nour ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own advertising business. In addition,\nGoogle previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar\nchanges to Apple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and\nmeasure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile\nproducts, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems,\nnetworks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers,\nmobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with\nkey participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these\ntechnologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to\naccess and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on\ntheir mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user\nengagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products\nor the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may\nadversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no\nassurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are\nadversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth,\nengagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced\nchallenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do\nnot control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and\nmonetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer\nhardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant\ninvestments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we continue to launch new\nAI features on our products, including support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and\nediting tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in\nconnection with these efforts.\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging\nproducts to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited\nfashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over\nthe long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and\nInstagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the\nNevada Attorney General is seeking to enjoin our offering of default end-to-end encryption on Messenger for all\nNevada residents under the age of 18.\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our\nbusiness plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue,\noperating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend\nrelevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features\nfor existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in\ninfrastructure and headcount. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial\nperformance could be harmed.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThere are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of\nAI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or\nprofitability. For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to\nrisks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to\nelections), bias, discrimination, toxicity, consumer protection, intellectual property infringement or\nmisappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is\nalso uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to\ncontent generated by AI. In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory\nscrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation\nand AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could\nadversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various\ngovernmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering\napplying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and data protection laws to\nAI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act). We may not always\nbe able to anticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks\nwill develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these frameworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may\nalso have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions\nif the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and\ntechnologies. Other companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our\ntechnologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of development in the AI\nsector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would\nprevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also\ndepend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to continue to develop and\neffectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and\nphysical infrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy\nrequirements, as to which we cannot control the availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive\nenvironment.\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license\nagreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not\nhave insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such AI technologies. As such,\nwe cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through\nthe dissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or\nmisappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination, cybersecurity attacks including spear phishing attacks, data\nprivacy violations, other activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to develop\ncompeting technologies. While we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models\nthrough both technical measures and the inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement\nbetween us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any\nthird party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and\nregulations or other regulatory developments regarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection\nand use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal liability.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our \"Your Activity off-Meta Technologies\" tool enables users to place limits on our storage\nand use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to\ndeliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly,\n21\nTable of Contents\nfrom time to time we update our Feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features to improve the user\nexperience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some\nmeasures of user engagement with our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time to\ntime, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization\nstrategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may\nadversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their\nincentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to\nexisting products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use\ncases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on\ngrowing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may\nin the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that\nwe monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote\nReels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the\nforeseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nOur Reality Labs efforts include our metaverse and wearables initiatives. We believe the metaverse, an embodied\ninternet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social\ntechnology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the\nmetaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build\nnext-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve\nthe development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy,\nsafety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants.\nHowever, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features,\nproducts, or services we build is uncertain. We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant\nchanges as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs\nevolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented,\nand mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be\nunsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships\nwith key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies,\nproducts, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the\nability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products\nwith the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our\nReality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect\nto continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to\nsupport these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from\nother areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of\nexisting or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas\nof privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, export controls, consumer protection, and\ne-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs,\nrequire significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other\nfactors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users,\nmarketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend\nlargely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may\nnot do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if\nusers do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting\nwith parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or\nregulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product\ndesign, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or\ndecisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and\n22\nTable of Contents\nmay in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, in January 2025, we announced certain\nchanges to our content policies and enforcement efforts to further free expression on our platform and mitigate\nover-enforcement of certain of our content policies. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media,\nlegislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement\npractices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In\naddition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared\nsuch data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or\nappropriately to the sharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are\nillegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce our policies, address objectionable\ncontent or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which\ncould erode confidence in our brands.\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate\nto other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or\nservices to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by\nperceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to\ncensor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends,\nincluding, for example, any such actions around geopolitical events or elections in the United States and around\nthe world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board,\nby research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-\nbeing, by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who\nviolate our community standards or terms of service, or by any negative sentiment associated with our management.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not\nbe successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns\naround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being\nissues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial\nresults may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that\nintegrate with our products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications\nthat integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building,\ngrowing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose\nto build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that\nintegrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers\nwith our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that\ncontinues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce\nthe volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the\nuser experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization\nopportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to\nprivacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and\nwe also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some\ninstances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely\naffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we\nare unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create,\nshare, communicate, and discover content\n23\nTable of Contents\nand information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract,\nengage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business\nand advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate\nwith our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed,\nand virtual reality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire\nnew products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including\nas part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies, as well as\nefforts to develop the metaverse.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we\nmake updates to our products and services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with\nsafe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user\ndemographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by\nmaking access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our\nusers; by limiting the ability of our devices or products to interoperate with their popular platforms or products;\nor by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device\noperating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have\nintegrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS\nthat limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads\neffectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate\nadvertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we\ncannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\n24\nTable of Contents\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly specialized technical personnel\nincluding software engineers, designers, and product managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers or advertising agencies or resellers in a\nparticular period;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe enforcement of our advertising policies, including the removal of ads and marketers from our platform;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\n25\nTable of Contents\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses, as well as capital expenditures, that we will incur\nto grow and expand our business and to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and\ntechnical infrastructure as well as other costs relating to our AI initiatives;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts,\nincluding as a result of implementing changes to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws,\nregulations, regulatory actions, or decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or\notherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment or abandonment of any assets on our balance sheet, including as a result of\nchanges to our real property lease arrangements and data center assets;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking that prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\nactions;\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection,\nantitrust, content, or AI, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of\ndiscrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\n26\nTable of Contents\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-\nmarketable equity securities, and in interest rates;\nthe incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, which may impact the other\nfactors described above.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Our reputation has been, and could in the future be,\nadversely affected by unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies,\nproduct decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our\nadvertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products\nor services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of\nservice, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform,\nthe perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the actions of\nother companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media\ncoverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other\ncontent, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics.\nBeginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the\nrelease of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be,\nsubject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable\nuse of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in the United\nStates and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and\nloyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased\nrevenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to\nvarying degrees from time to time.\nWe are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our\nbusiness and operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of public health crises such as pandemics, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions,\nother natural disasters, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, power loss, cyber-\nattacks, and other catastrophic events and crises. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic previously significantly\nimpacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic led to volatility in the demand for\nand pricing of our advertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar\neffects in the future as a result of the pandemic or other catastrophic events. Such events also expose our\nbusiness, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including: volatility in the size of our user base\nand user engagement; delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales\nof consumer hardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages; significant volatility\nand disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively\nimpact our ability to access capital in the future; illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our\nworkforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and increased volatility\nand uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments\nin our artificial intelligence initiatives as well as Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating\nmargin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance\nwill be harmed.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the\nfuture as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data\nthey share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new\nand existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue\nto invest in new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to\nfocus on privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement. We have previously\nundertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect\nthese or other business initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-\nfront charges and outlays of cash to reduce certain longer-\n27\nTable of Contents\nterm expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary\npenalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also\ncontinuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part of our metaverse and\nwearables efforts. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in Reality Labs, have\ngenerated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse\nfinancial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in\nReality Labs reduced our 2024 overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we expect our Reality\nLabs investments and operating losses to increase in 2025. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our\nbusiness and financial performance will be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our products and services could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and\nengagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and services and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and services from time to time. Our\nsystems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid\nperformance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products or services are unavailable\nwhen users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or\nservices as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could\nadversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from\ntime to time. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and\nevolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands\ncontinue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical\ninfrastructure, including network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. Although we are making significant investments in our technical infrastructure, it is possible\nthat we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these\nincreased demands or achieve our business objectives, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from\nearthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict,\nother physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events and crises. Global climate change\ncould result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such\nevents may result in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our\ntechnical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely\naffect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other\ncosts to maintain the availability or performance of our products and services in connection with any such events.\nA substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in\nthe services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and\ncould significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely\naffect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to\nproblems with the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various\nchallenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have adjusted,\nand may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape. We may not\nbe able to secure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may\nbe required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or\nservices, require unfavorable changes to existing products or services, delay the introduction of future products\nor services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have experienced, and could experience in the future, difficulties in building and operating key portions of our\ntechnical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\ndeveloping regions that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance, trade compliance, and\npolitical challenges, among others. We have\n28\nTable of Contents\nchanged, suspended, and terminated certain of these projects as a result of various factors, and may continue to do\nso in the future. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due\nto the availability of components, power or network capacity, or any shortage of labor necessary in building\nportions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other\ngeopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to\nincreased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or\nreliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. For example, like others in\nour industry, we rely on certain third-party equipment and components for our technical infrastructure that are\nmanufactured by a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia.\nAny of the foregoing delays or disruptions, including actions by governments or geopolitical events such as\ninternational conflicts, could result in tariffs, sanctions, export or import controls, and other measures that\nrestrict international trade, could reduce or eliminate the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers, or other\nthird-party providers to continue their operations to manufacture, or limit or eliminate our ability to purchase,\nkey components of our technical infrastructure.\nIn addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases\nof design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying\nequipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical\ninfrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such\ngovernment action, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical\ninfrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to\na negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), are calculated using\ninternal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to\nbe reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in\nmeasuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used\nto measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical\nerrors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may\nchange due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these\nmetrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their\naccuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical\nmetrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for\nsuch adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such\ninaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences\nin methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile\npopulations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances\nexceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error\nmargin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary\n29\nTable of Contents\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible\nthat our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on\ninternal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant\njudgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within\nindividual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP\naddresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes\nand frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently\nsubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future\ncontribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may\naffect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics\nestimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more\nlimited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into\nencrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and\ndevice information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data\nsignals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions,\nactions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also\nmay impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics\nat all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the\napplication of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys,\nalgorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or\notherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify\npreviously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than\n3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a\nlimited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look\nfor account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic\nto the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we\nbelieve an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating\naccounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From\ntime to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of\nviolating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to\ncontinue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an\nannual basis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions\ndelivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges\nin measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number\nof factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately\nreflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location\nof the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used\nto measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other\ninquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not\nperceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material\n30\nTable of Contents\ninaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and\nmarketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad\nimpressions, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.\nOur employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The\nscale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for our management, operational,\nand financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other\nthird parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the\nscale and complexity of our business. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our\noperational, financial, and management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively\ntrain and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity\nand collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency\nand realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives,\nincluding restructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to scale down our office facilities. These efforts also\nsubject us to risks such as greater than anticipated costs, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased\ndifficulty managing the scale and complexity of our business. For example, we could face delays or challenges with\nproduct development, other business and strategic initiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as well as other\ndisruptions to our operations. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt\ncomplex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate\nculture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments\ncould negatively affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks\nthat could affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make our Family products available in a total of more\nthan 100 different languages, and we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may\nenter new international regions where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our\nproducts. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not\nbe available in certain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are\nnot generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we\nfail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition,\nwe are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, accessibility, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards, terms of service,\nand other policies across different languages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal,\n31\nTable of Contents\ncontent moderation, data localization, data protection, competition, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory\noversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and\npandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not\nproperly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products\ndepends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia. We\nhave experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in\nlogistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product\ndevelopment, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse\nchanges in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and\nsale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments or non-state actors (including international conflicts,\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to\nsupply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety,\nthe environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards and have\nexperienced violations of these requirements from time to time. If any supplier or business partner violates laws,\nfails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as\nunethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines,\ncanceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, higher\ntariffs that increase consumer prices, and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly\nbetween the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict\nthese trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we\nhave experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In\naddition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international\nregions, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component\nselection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require\nsignificant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely\naffect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced,\ncurrently face, and will continue to face additional class action and other lawsuits based on claims related to\nadvertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related\nto the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and\nunproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our\nplatform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third\nparties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of\n2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former\nemployee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential\naudience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the\nsubject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of biometric technology, our alleged recommendation of\nand/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our\nalleged use of copyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram\ncause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection\nAct (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative\noutcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable\nchanges to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023\nfollowing the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority's order directing us to divest Giphy post-\nacquisition. In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after prevailing in\nfederal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of\nsuch acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is\n33\nTable of Contents\nno assurance that we will realize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions\nor a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in\nincreased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions\nthat would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions\nand we regularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase\nour expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,\ndevelopers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make, substantial investments of resources\nto support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of\nresources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments\nwill be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits\nexpected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on a\nBase Erosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing\nframework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. A number\nof countries have enacted legislation to implement the OECD’s 15% global minimum tax regime. As additional\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation\nbecome effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. Similarly, the\nEuropean Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current\ninternational tax rules under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing rules to\ncalculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based\non a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital\nservices, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our\nbusiness. There are ongoing OECD negotiations that contemplate an alternative to these proposals, which may\nproliferate in the absence of multilateral agreement.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary,\nsignificantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future\nimpact, our effective tax rate, sometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price\nvaries from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax\nbenefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2024, excess tax benefits\nrecognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $3.22 billion and our\neffective income tax rate by five percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future\nperiods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in\nthat period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation\nissued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based\ncompensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not\ncontrol, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect\nour financial results.\n35\nTable of Contents\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results\nof operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr.\nZuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat\nsports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death. If Mr.\nZuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations.\nThe loss of other key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development,\nmarketing, and sales personnel, could also disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In particular, we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring specialized\ntechnical personnel, particularly senior engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other\ncompanies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees\nprovided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue\nsignificant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial\nadditional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price\nvolatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to\nimmigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing\npersonnel. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and\nmotivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or\nprevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our\nother stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a\ntransaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential\ninvestor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common\nstock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to\ncontrol the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death,\nthe shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has\ndesignated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in\ngood faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder,\neven a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not\nalways be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases and dividend payments could also increase the volatility of the trading price\nof our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. The specific timing and amount of any share repurchases, and the specific\ntiming and amount of any\n36\nTable of Contents\ndividend payments, will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, company\nperformance, and other considerations. We cannot guarantee that the repurchase program will be fully consummated or\nthat it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase program and dividend payments could affect the\ntrading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this repurchase\nprogram or dividend payments may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this\nrepurchase program and dividend payments will diminish our cash reserves.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nThe payment of any cash dividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions,\napplicable laws and agreements, and our board of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of\ndividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be\ndiscontinued or reduced at any time, and there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the\nfuture in any particular amounts, or at all.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising\nin their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides\nauthorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services,\nand if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong has\npassed additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make\nchanges to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or\nother legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In addition, in connection\nwith the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and\nthe services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue\nto adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver\nadvertising, including in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For\nexample, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it\nis possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our\nChina-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any\ntariffs implemented by the United States or China, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong\nKong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other\npenalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the\nTurkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise\nadversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is\nsubject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are\nrequired to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our\ncompetitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing\ngeographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our\nuser base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able\nto maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use,\ndata combination, data protection, content, competition, youth, safety, consumer protection, advertising,\ne-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain\ninterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties,\nincreased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the\nprovision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity,\nintellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data\nlocalization and storage, data disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications,\ncompetition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product\nliability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and\npolitical law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products,\nexpansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to\nadditional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be\nimposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced\nby private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and\napplied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and\npractices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display\ncontent to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various\nways, including for advertising, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and\nengagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results,\nincluding by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms\nIreland’s reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective\norders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations\ninto compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the\nUnited States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish\nHigh Court.\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle\non a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive\nOrder on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the\nEuropean Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney\nGeneral as a “qualifying state” under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an\nadequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures\nan adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the\nUnited States that are included in the “Data Privacy Framework List,” maintained and made publicly available by the\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the\nadequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above\ncorrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which\nwere invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable\nuncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a\n38\nTable of Contents\nnumber of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in India and other jurisdictions regarding the 2021\nupdates to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products\nand services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India and an order by the\nCompetition Commission of India, which we are appealing. If we are unable to transfer data between and among\ncountries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and\nservices, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our\nability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or\nnew legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have\nimplemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission\nof personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the\nregulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft\ndecisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the\nGDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We\nalso face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those\nregulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing\nundertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well\nas the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it\nevolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the\nUnited Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related\nrequirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer\nPrivacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules\nand creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal\ninformation and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties.\nOther states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data\nprivacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting\nlimitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or\nenacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents\nor guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may\nrestrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those\nstates, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy\nDirective's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing\nspecific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy\nDirective and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging\nproducts and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a\nresult of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our\nadvertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change\nthe legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area,\nand Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the\nregion a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including\nregarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the\nEuropean Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with\nrequirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data\nProtection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer\nprotection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response\nto these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and\nSwitzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less\npersonalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any\nsimilar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial\nresults.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and\nrequirements on\n39\nTable of Contents\ncompanies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions,\nand product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are\nenforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future\ncause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The\nrequirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or\nfuture proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the\nDSA, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for\nour products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-\ncompliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK,\nIndia, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new\ncompetition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could\nrequire substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us\nto cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties.\nNew legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or\nalso limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain\njurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among\nothers, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise\nlimiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of\nthem) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these\nstatutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may\nnot be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be\nable to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges\nin light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is\nexpected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to\nensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of\nexisting laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to\nallegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur\nsignificant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to\nadditional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions. In\naddition, the Province of British Columbia has considered, and may in the future consider, a bill that would permit\nthe government to recover public health-related costs potentially associated with providing goods and services in\nBritish Columbia, including potentially social media services.\nWe are also subject to disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements regarding our social and environmental\nrisks and initiatives. There has been increased focus on these initiatives by many regulators, investors, and other\nstakeholders and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable federal, state, local or\ninternational laws and regulations could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government\nactions, have led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs,\nchanges to our products, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative\npublicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and\nremedies that harm our business, including fines, damages, or orders that we modify or cease existing business\npractices.\nWe have been and remain subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and\nsettlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which\ncould cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially\nadverse to our business.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and\ndata protection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for\nadvertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject rights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection,\ncivil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable\nactivity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject\nto regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, content, and consumer\nprotection authorities in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions have initiated actions,\n40\nTable of Contents\ninvestigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or\nimpose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, we have been and continue to be the subject\nof litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information, including where\nadvertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In\naddition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data\npractices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to\nresolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and\nlitigation, and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to\nmonitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against\nus, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations\nof the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and\nthe agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations,\nincluding on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also\nnotify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other\npersonal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws\n(such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and\ninvestigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In\naddition, we are subject to inquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with\nvarious provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and Instagram, including matters related to\nelections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential\ndeceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the\nfuture be, subject to penalties, fines, and requirements to change our business practices as a result of such\ninquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a lawsuit by the\nstate of Texas in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business,\nincluding with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other\nthings, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services,\ndigital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in\n2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the FTC and the U.S. Department of\nJustice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws,\nincluding by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against\nour company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or\nreconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission issued a fine as a\nresult of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes\nEuropean Union competition rules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to\nour business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to\ngovernment investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a\nformer employee.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business\npractices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data\npractices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy\nDirective, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant\noperational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\n41\nTable of Contents\nrequirements around the world, such as U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive,\nDMA, DSA, EU AI Act, the Korean Personal Information Protection Act, and the Indian Digital Personal Data\nProtection Act. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC\nconsent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational\nrequirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a\nprocess to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our\nprivacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and\ncostly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and\nresources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes,\npersonnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist with these\nefforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In\naddition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as\nproduct and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe our ability to\ndevelop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be\nadversely affected. Further, our privacy compliance and oversight efforts have required, and we expect will\ncontinue to require, significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of\nthe FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business,\nand from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these\nrequirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in\nthe future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject\nto significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we are subject to restrictions and requirements\nunder the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design, which will\nlikely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement.\nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with\nthe FTC consent order and seeking substantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a\nprohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. We are challenging the\nFTC's administrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order\nin its current form, it would limit our ability to provide certain features and services, engage in certain\nbusiness practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance and\noversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any\nfuture modifications to the order), GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, ePrivacy Directive,\nDMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant authority believes that we are in\nviolation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental\ninvestigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines or damages (including for loss of\ncontrol of data without other damage), judgments, penalties, or other remedies, and we may also be required to make\nadditional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government and regulatory inquiries relating to\ninformation or content that is published or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and\ninvestigations relating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement decisions with respect to such information or\ncontent. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of\nmisinformation or news hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual\nproperty rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types\nof content, on- or offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or\ndistribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and\nother fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity), products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract,\namong others. For example, over the last several years we have seen an increase in claims brought by younger users\nrelated to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products.\nIn addition, we have been subject to litigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute\nviolations of anti-discrimination laws.\nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain\njurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear\nor where we may be less\n42\nTable of Contents\nprotected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed\na directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and\nregulating certain uses of news content online, which the EU member states have since implemented into their\nnational laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to\nonline video-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. Additionally, Brazil has an intermediary\nliability framework limiting liability for third-party content, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and\nis under review by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral\nargument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its\ndecision. There also have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal\nlegislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as\nto impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including\nelectoral-related and AI-generated content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current\nprotections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial\nor government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany\nand India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to\ncomply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other\ncountries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar\nlegislation imposing liability or potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or\nadvertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have\nbeen subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media\nlegislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-\nrelated legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business\npractices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain\ngeographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain\nauthorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which\nmay require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the\nEuropean Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and\nservices are subject to restrictions and requirements, and we are subject to increased compliance costs, and\npotential fines or other penalties in the event of non-compliance, as a result of the Digital Services Act in the\nEuropean Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, and other content-related legislative\ndevelopments such as the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in the United\nKingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for\ncertain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have ended\nthe availability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. In the United States, changes to the\nprotections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal\ncontent-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant changes to our\nproducts, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement.\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other\nrisks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual,\nand digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send\nmoney to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing\nanti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other\nprepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable\nfundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new\nconsumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments\nactivity as well as sharing, collection, and use of payments-related data. For example, the CFPB issued its\nanticipated Larger Participant Rule, effective January 2025, allowing the CFPB to conduct supervisory activities\nover general-use digital consumer payment applications. The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade\nassociation, could subject certain of our payments products to this authority. Depending on how our Payments\nproducts evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking,\nand lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear.\nWe have received certain\n43\nTable of Contents\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions for our regulated\nPayments-related products and activities. These licenses increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may\nevolve, help mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many\ndomestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities. Our efforts to comply with\nthese laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and may still\nnot guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory\nrequirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be\nrequired to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the\nfuture undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us\nto many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to\ndisrupt our ability to provide service or otherwise harm us. Our products and services involve the collection,\nstorage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security\nbreaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or\npayment information from users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure,\ndestruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our\ncompetitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks),\nscraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will\noccur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user\naccounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading\nmisinformation, or other illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size\nof our user base, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our\nproducts and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a\nparticularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly\nsophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to\ntime as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase\nthe risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide,\ndegrade the user experience or otherwise adversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and\ntrust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our\ncompany data or the information we receive, and to prevent or disable undesirable activities on our platform, may\nalso be unsuccessful due to software bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or other technical malfunctions;\nemployee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; social engineering or other cyber-attacks directed towards\nour personnel or their access; misuse of company data or systems by our personnel; defects or vulnerabilities in\nour vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government exploitation or surveillance; breaches of\nphysical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats that evolve. In\naddition, other parties may attempt to fraudulently or maliciously induce employees, contractors, vendors, or users\nto disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in\nsophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have\ndeveloped systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to reduce the risk of data\nloss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to reduce the risk of or detect\nsecurity breaches, such measures will not provide absolute security, and we cannot assure you that we will be able\nto react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or that our remediation efforts will\nbe successful. Our business and operations span numerous geographies around the world and involve thousands of\nemployees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties. At any given time, we face known\nand unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our\nsecurity efforts.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products.\n44\nTable of Contents\nWe provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us. However, if\nthese third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a\nbreach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.\nWe regularly experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, including the\nGDPR and EU member state laws implementing the EU Cybersecurity Directive (NIS2), as well as obligations under our\nmodified consent order with the FTC. As a result, government authorities, affected users, or other parties could\ninitiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches,\nimproper access to or disclosure of data, or other cybersecurity issues, which has occurred in the past and which\ncould cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to\nmodify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a\ndecline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect\non our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIntentional misuse of our services and user data and other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intentional misuse of our services and user data by\nthird parties, as well as other undesirable, illicit, or high-risk activity on our platform. We are making\nsignificant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review efforts to combat these\nactivities, including investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. We\nhave discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents\nof misuse of user data or other undesirable or illicit activity by third parties or malfeasant internal actors. We\nwill not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations,\nincluding our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation\nof resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the\nindependent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, government authorities, the\nmedia, or other third parties.\nSuch incidents and activities include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms,\ncontracts or policies, the existence of hacked, false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper\nadvertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline (such as acts of\nviolence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation,\nchild exploitation, and illegal gaming), instances of spamming, surveillance, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured\ndatasets, or spreading misinformation, or other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity. From time to time we are\nunsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. We may\nalso be subject to increased risk as a result of changes to our content policies and enforcement efforts which we\nbegan to implement in January 2025 to further free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of\ncertain of our content policies.\nConsequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to\nour reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse\neffects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and may in the future subject, us\nto additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert\nmanagement's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties (including open source software and the operating systems and\nbrowsers which users rely on to run our applications and access our systems), that is highly technical and complex.\nIn addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store,\nretrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained,\nand will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical\nlimitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities\ninherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or\ninternal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within\n45\nTable of Contents\nthe software and hardware on which we rely, or human error or malfeasance in using such systems, have led to, and\nmay in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience or other adverse effects for users and\nmarketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our\nterms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing\nerrors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or\nreductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as\nto how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are\nsubject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably.\nIn addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we\nrely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations\nor interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory\ninquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source and other permissive licenses and have\nmade other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open source software in our\nproducts. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our\nAI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions\nand the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or\ninnovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If\nthe protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third\nparties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more\neffectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other\nintellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a\nsignificant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which\ncould increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other\nrights holders.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that\ncertain of our products and services, trademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We\npresently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and\ndevelop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow.\nDefending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and\nemployees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition,\nplaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such\nlitigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us\n46\nTable of Contents\nto change or cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that\nare unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be\nsubject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment\nmay require us to change or cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In\naddition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights,\nwhich may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and\nexpenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or\nbranding or discontinue the practices or branding. The development of alternative non-infringing technology,\nbranding or practices could require significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology,\nbranding or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have\nexperienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the\ndisputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $638.40 through December 31, 2024. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\n47\nTable of Contents\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely\naffect our business.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and\ncertain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate\nmatters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of\nour Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting\npower of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to\nour stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your\nability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n48\nTable of Contents\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our board chair, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware."

                "content": "Cybersecurity\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is\nprone to cybersecurity threats and attacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees.\nWe believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence and scale, the types and volume of\npersonal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and\nservices reach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large\namount of data. In addition, our business and operations span numerous geographies around the world, involve\nthousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on software\nand hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of\npolicies and controls designed to mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and\nunknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our\nprogram. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and\nindustry-recognized practices, for managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure,\nand corporate resources.To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats, we evaluate a variety of\ndevelopments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory\nrequirements, and observed cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate\nthe maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes in addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify\nareas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as\nbenchmarking against industry practices. However, we may not be successful in fully addressing such areas for\nremediation or enhancement.In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess privacy risks\nrelated to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to assessment by an\nindependent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and\nassurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting control\nframeworks.These processes\n49\nTable of Contents\nsupport informed risk-based decision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation\nstrategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of technical and operational measures, as well\nas annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our\nthird-party assessment (TPA) process. Under our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who\ncontract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with our systems, in order to help us\nassess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among\nother things, maintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of\nmaterial data breaches that may impact our data.\nOur board of directorshas oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity\nrisk management oversight to the audit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight\nCommittee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place\ndesigned to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement processes\nand programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy & product compliance\ncommittee of our board of directors (Privacy & Product Compliance Committee) oversees risks related to privacy and\ndata use, including overseeing compliance with our comprehensive privacy program. Management is responsible for\nidentifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to\nensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation\nmeasures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and procedures, and providing regular reports to our board of\ndirectors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and Privacy & Product Compliance Committee.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),Guy Rosen, leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across\nthe company supporting our security functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover.These teams are\ncomprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private and public sectors, the technology\nindustry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity,\nsoftware development, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of\nsignificant leadership roles at our company since 2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity\ninitiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022. Prior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served in senior\nleadership, engineering, and operational roles across technology organizations.\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents\nthrough a variety of technical and operational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the\nsenior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee on the company’s\ncybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.\nIn 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.However, despite our\nefforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not\nexperienced undetected cybersecurity incidents.

                "content": "Legal Proceedings\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to\nnumerous claims, litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal\nproceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are\nvigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved\nadversely or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide\nto settle litigation, disputes, or other legal proceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nIn addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or regulatory authorities.\nAny such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability\n(including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or\nrequire us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to\nour products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert\nresources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or\nbehavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the\npast, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of\ncomplex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and\nadvertiser base.\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving\nthe company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are\nfacing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to\ndismiss, including through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to\nnew regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in\nnon-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining guidelines under\nexisting regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and\ninvestigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe,\nincluding class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage)\nand/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also\nresponding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to\nvarious societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger\nusers, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful discrimination,\nand other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax, competition\nand antitrust, stockholder, commercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the\nnumber of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial damages awards and\nfines has increased.\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have\nnot previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be\nvery difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the nature and extent of\ninjunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures,\ndisgorgement, fines or penalties. While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material,\nthere can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from\nclaims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United\nStates and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that\nshared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection,\nprivacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the\nparties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by\nus. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two\nobjectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is\nfully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as\nthe events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), state\n51\nTable of Contents\nattorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered\ninto a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy\ncompliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in\nother jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to\nchange our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely\naffect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia\ngranted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of\nColumbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the\nNew Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19,\n2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was\ndismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking\nsubstantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and\ninclude, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the\ncomposition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new\nproducts. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v.\nFacebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent\norder. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding\npending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying\nappeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to\npreliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed\nan opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024,\nthe district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the\nlitigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme\nCourt's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was\ndenied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a\nrenewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The\nparties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the\nFTC's motion to dismiss.\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the\nOrder to Show Cause proceeding was legally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal\nissues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners on those issues on November 12,\n2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to\nMeta’s jurisdictional challenges currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. , and that the nature and scope of any further administrative proceedings would\nbe addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the\nadditional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision\nmodifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order\nwhile the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European\nregulators under\n52\nTable of Contents\nother laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to\ninquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory\ncompliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent\nmodel with requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding\nthat Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European\nEconomic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine\nof EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers\nand to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing,\nincluding storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently\nsubject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive\nOrder on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the\nEuropean Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney\nGeneral as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an\nadequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures\nan adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the\nUnited States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The\nimplementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have\nimplemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. For additional\ninformation, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign\nlaws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data combination, data protection, content, competition, youth,\nsafety, consumer protection, advertising, e-commerce, and other matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Any\nsuch inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceedings) could subject us to substantial fines and costs,\nrequire us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or\nadversely affect our business.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly\nreceived individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our\nterms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re\nMeta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor,\nInc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara County Superior Court). These cases\nare in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain\nothers have been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in\nthe cases that are most advanced.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\n2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a\npermanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,\nincluding divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion\nto dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended\ncomplaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our motion for summary\njudgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On\nNovember 13, 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC’s motions for summary\njudgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state\nand federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws\nand other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and\nseeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et\nal., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to\ndismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the\nputative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our\n53\nTable of Contents\nmotion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers. On December 30, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action\nbrought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook\nMarketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18,\n2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102 on the Treaty of the Functioning of\nthe European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a\nfine of approximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission's decision on January 28, 2025.\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\"\nconsent model with requirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued\npreliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such\nrequirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and\ncosts, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management\nfrom our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook,\nInc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and\nuser data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the\nplaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their\ncase, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in\npart and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ\nof certiorari on March 4, 2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The\nSupreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2024, and following oral argument\nissued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages ( Ohio Pub.\nEmpl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with leave to\namend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed\nagainst us and certain of our current and former directors and officers.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages ( Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court\ndismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint and on September 17, 2024, the court dismissed the claims with prejudice. On October 14, 2024,\nplaintiffs filed their notice of appeal.\n54\nTable of Contents\nYouth-Related Actions\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users, with most\nproceedings focused on those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class\nactions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and\nnumerous school districts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United\nStates, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were\ncentralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Social Media Adolescent\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation ). Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories\nbegan filing lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include\nallegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child sexual abuse\nmaterial and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business\npractices, public nuisance, and products liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices\n(including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and\ninjunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, as well as various state courts around the country. Beginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands\nof individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to \"social media addiction\" and related\nharms allegedly caused by Instagram.\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions\nglobally concerning the use of our products and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety\nimpacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings\nassessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and\nother vulnerable users that may stem from the design and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve\nv. Facebook, Inc. ) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and\n2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition\nclaims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March\n21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order granting\nclass certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was\ndenied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2,\n2024, which was denied.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nand Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee,\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al. , which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California) alleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our\nartificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. These cases have all been\nconsolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Vivek H. Murthy, Surgeon General, et al. v.\nMissouri, et al. , on the question of whether federal government officials violated the First Amendment in their\ncommunications with the company and others related to content moderation practices, and heard argument in\nNetchoice, et al. v. Paxton and Moody, et al. v. Netchoice et al. , regarding the application of the First\nAmendment relating to content moderation on tech platforms. As to Murthy , a majority of the Supreme Court decided\nthe case on plaintiffs' standing, declining to rule on the First Amendment questions, and sending the case back\ndown to the lower courts where the case continues. As to NetChoice , the Supreme Court unanimously vacated the\nintermediate appellate court decisions, remanding the cases back to the lower courts. Although we are not a party\nin these actions, the ultimate resolution of the lawsuits and similar others still pending in the federal courts\ncould impact our business.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOn April 30, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings against us to assess Facebook and Instagram's\ncompliance with certain requirements under Articles 14, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 40 of the DSA, regarding a\nrange of topics including elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content\nrecommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified,\nassessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks on Instagram and Facebook. We are also responding to\nregulatory inquiries and litigation related to allegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to\nfinancial scams, in other parts of the world.\nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and\nOpportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products\nand services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the Director of the CFPB that the Bureau\ntake legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged\nreceipt and use for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as\nwell as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided us with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with\nthe claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded through the\nNORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action\nagainst us, the CFPB could file a lawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal\nproceedings and disputes in the future."

                "content": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with\nour consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\nOur financial results and key Family metrics for 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50\nbillion, an increase of 22% compared to 2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant\ncurrency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in\n2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year.\nIncome from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023, driven\nby an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs\nand expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical\ninfrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.\n59\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated and Segment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA\nincludes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services.

Total dividends and dividend\nequivalents paid were $4.38 billion and $691 million for Class A and Class B common stock, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively.\nFamily of Apps Metrics\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 3.35 billion on average for December 2024, an increase of 5% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 11% year-over-year in 2024.\nAverage price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year in 2024.\nDevelopments in Advertising\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on\ntargeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to\nour users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced\nmarketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the\nregulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including\nits evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive,\nEuropean Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our\nad products, and an increasing\n60\nTable of Contents\nnumber of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users. We\nexpect these and other developments will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and\nwe will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices,\nwhich reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue\nand user engagement. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to\nchange the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue\nusing our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to\nbe less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and\nuse these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS\ndevelopers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue\nto negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising\nplatforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the\nperformance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and\nmeasurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on\nanonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share\ntheir data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More\nbroadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with\nconsumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across\nall of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative\nAI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite\nconversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the\nprivate and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting\nand measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these\nefforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described\nabove will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with\nglobal content, security, and integrity obligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and\nmarketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we expect that the continued\nenhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will\ncontinue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe\nadvertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, high interest rates, and\nrelated market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty\nremains, which could impact our financial results in future periods.\nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services.\nWe are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to\nrecommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our\nproducts. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics, in\nparticular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed\nand Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also\nhave seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time\ndue to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends\nadversely affected advertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in\nthe foreseeable future.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have\nperfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex\njudgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the\nglobe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to\nidentify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to\nquantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.\nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several\nefforts to increase our operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant\nopportunities. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL.\nOur FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of\nour efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI\ninitiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop\nnew products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. In particular, we expect our AI\ninitiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts, including developing virtual,\naugmented, and mixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational\ntechnologies. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of\nour RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products that may only\nbe fully realized in the next decade. In 2024, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately\n$17.73 billion, and we continue to expect our RL operating losses to increase in 2025. We expect this will be a\ncomplex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our RL efforts is dependent on generating\nsufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next\nchapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators,\nincluding around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n62\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Revenue by User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. The geography of our\nusers affects our revenue and financial results. Our revenue in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe\nis relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets, and ad\nimpression growth is primarily in geographies that monetize at lower rates, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World.\nIn 2024, revenue increased by 18% in United States & Canada, 26% in Europe, 22% in Asia-Pacific, and 31% in Rest of\nWorld, in each case relative to 2023.\n-\nAd Revenue    Non-Ad Revenue\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we\nreceive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\n63\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our\nother products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their other activities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\nSubstantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP as a measure of engagement across our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n------\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique\npeople using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for\nthese estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of\nour worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across\nproducts to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may\nvary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information,\nsee the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Beginning\nin the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\nWorldwide DAP increased 5% to 3.35 billion on average during December 2024 from 3.19 billion during December 2023.\n64\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). Our Family of Apps (FoA) revenue represents the substantial majority of our\ntotal revenue. We define ARPP as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of\nDAP at the beginning and end of the quarter.\nARPP:    $10.68    $9.47        $10.42    $10.93    $12.33            $11.20    $11.89    $12.29    $14.25\nAd Revenue                        Non-Ad Revenue\nNote: We updated our definition of ARPP beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and have recast ARPP in prior\nperiods for comparative purposes.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2024, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $49.63, an\nincrease of 15% from 2023.\n65\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Ad Impressions and Average Price Per Ad\nAd Impressions. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger,\nand third-party mobile applications. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user.\nNote: Our ad impressions growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our\nestimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered.\n66\nTable of Contents\nAverage Price Per Ad. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads\ndelivered.\nNote: Our average price per ad growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on\nour estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered.\n67\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting\nestimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material\ndue to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes\nof the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the\nestimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when\napplicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider\nthese to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting\npolicies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions\nare finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other\nfactors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\nrevised in the future.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ from management's\nestimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial\ncondition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. See\nNote 12 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3,\n\"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income\n(loss) before\n68\nTable of Contents\nprovision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required\nin determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties with our research and\ndevelopment tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer\npricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Although we believe that we have\nadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no\nassurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment\nand assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and\ncompanies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets,\noccurs whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable\ncompared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual\ndisposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the\ncarrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair\nvalue.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for\nusing the measurement alternative is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering\nevents for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's\nfinancial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological\nenvironment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the\nmarket approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income\nif the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity\nsecurities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-\nmarketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations\nassociated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion\nfeatures, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and\nobligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. The identification of\nobservable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment\nfor these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which\nresulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on\nthe servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting\nestimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information\nregarding the change in useful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n69\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad\nproducts either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number\nof impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are\nnot currently monetized at the same rate as our Feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or\ndecrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate\naverage price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average\nprice paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising\nrevenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net\nfees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI\nglasses, and related software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our\nproducts. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee compensation which\nincludes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and\nbandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic\nacquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs,\nwhich consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content\ncosts.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist mostly of employee compensation which includes\npayroll, share-based compensation and benefits for our employees on our engineering and technical teams who are\nresponsible for developing new technologies and products; RL technology development costs; infrastructure costs;\nand facilities-related costs.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes\npayroll, share-based compensation and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing,\nbusiness development, and customer service functions; marketing and promotional expenses; and professional services\nto support our community and product operations.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which\nincludes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for certain of our executives as well as our legal,\nfinance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related\ncosts, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as\nwell as other legal fees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; and\nprofessional services.\n70\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2023.

The increase was almost entirely driven by\nadvertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions\ndelivered and average price per ad. In 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28%\nincrease in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in all regions, especially in Asia-\nPacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In\n2024, the average price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The\nincrease in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is\nmainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase\nwas partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products,\nsuch as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive\nOverview of Full Year 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the\nincrease in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be\ndriven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered.\nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by\nWhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in\nRL consumer hardware products sold.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and\n16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17% compared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively.\n72\nTable of Contents\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nChanges in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the full year 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue using the prior\nyear's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Using these\nconstant rates for full year 2024, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $165.37 billion and\n$161.51 billion, which were $874 million and $880 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue,\nrespectively.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                       2024 vs 2023 %       2023 vs 2022 %\n2024            2023            2022               change               change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nCost of          $          30,161       $  25,959       $  25,249                   16  %                 3  %\nrevenue\nPercentage of                   18  %           19  %           22  %\nrevenue\nCost of revenue in 2024 increased $4.20 billion, or 16%, compared to 2023.

RL costs and expenses increased primarily due to increases in employee compensation and\ninfrastructure costs.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring, Note 7 — Property and Equipment, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 —\nSegment and Geographical Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding restructuring charges, depreciation expense, legal-related costs, and segment employee compensation,\nrespectively.\n74\nTable of Contents\nInterest and other income (expense), net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                              2024 vs 2023 %         2023 vs 2022 %\n2024        2023       2022               change                 change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nInterest income     $              2,517    $  1,639    $   461                   54  %                 256  %\nInterest expense                    -715        -446       -185                  -60  %                -141  %\nForeign currency\nexchange losses,                    -690        -366        -81                  -89  %                -352  %\nnet\nOther income                         171        -150       -320                  214  %                  53  %\n(expense), net\nTotal interest\nand other income    $              1,283    $    677    $  -125                   90  %                      NM\n(expense), net\n____________________________________\nNM - not meaningful\nInterest and other income (expense), net in 2024 increased $606 million compared to 2023, mostly due to an increase\nin interest income from a combination of higher balances and interest rates, partially offset by an increase in\ninterest expense on our long-term debt.\nProvision for income taxes\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                     2024 vs 2023 %        2023 vs 2022 %\n2024           2023           2022       change                        change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nProvision for     $           8,303       $  8,330       $  5,619       —                %                48  %\nincome taxes\nEffective tax                    12  %          18  %          19  %\nrate\nOur provision for income taxes in 2024 decreased $27 million compared to 2023, due to a decrease in the effective\ntax rate, offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes.\nOur effective tax rate in 2024 decreased compared to 2023, primarily due to excess tax benefits recognized from\nshare-based compensation and an increase in research tax credits.\nEffective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not\nexpected to be utilized, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the\neffects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 24,\n2025 price, and absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to\nbe in the range of 12-15%. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research\nand development expenses incurred in 2024, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory\ncapitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax\nrate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is\ndeferred, our effective tax rate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities\ncould be lower.\nA number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment’s 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to evaluate the impacts of proposed and\nenacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. As additional\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation\nbecome effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\n75\nTable of Contents\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2024, we had net uncertain tax positions of $9.99 billion which was\nincluded in long-term income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets. These unrecognized tax benefits were\npredominantly accrued for uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. The\nultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would\notherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current\nstatus of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the\nnext 12 months.\nSee Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from\noperations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time\ndeposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, investment grade corporate debt securities,\nand marketable equity securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large\nfinancial institutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities were $77.81 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $12.41 billion\nfrom December 31, 2023. The increase was due to $91.33 billion of cash generated from operations and $10.43 billion\nof net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in August 2024. These increases\nwere offset by $39.23 billion of capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, our capital\nreturns of $35.20 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and payments of dividends and dividend\nequivalents, and $13.77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit\n(RSU) awards.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024          2023          2022\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   91,328    $   71,113    $   50,475\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                  -47,150    $  -24,495    $  -28,970\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -40,781    $  -19,500    $  -22,136\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $62.36 billion net income adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, such as $16.69 billion of share-based compensation expense and $15.50 billion of\ndepreciation and amortization expense. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2024 compared to\n2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially\noffset by higher cash paid for income taxes and other operational spending.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $37.26 billion of purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $9.75 billion of net\npurchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2024 compared to 2023\nwas mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable debt securities and property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 to support our core\nbusiness and generative AI efforts.\n76\nTable of Contents\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $30.13 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock, $5.07 billion of payments of dividends and dividend equivalents, and $13.77 billion of taxes paid\nrelated to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $10.43 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of\nadditional Notes in August 2024. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2024 compared to 2023,\nwas mostly due to increases in our capital returns of $10.35 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock\nand $5.07 billion for quarterly dividend payments that began in March 2024, as well as a $6.76 billion increase in\ntaxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024          2023          2022\nNet cash provided by operating          $                   91,328    $   71,113    $   50,475\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment                        -37,256       -27,045       -31,186\nPrincipal payments on finance leases                        -1,969        -1,058          -850\nFree cash flow                          $                   52,103    $   43,010    $   18,439\n77\nTable of Contents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be\nsufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our investments in infrastructure and AI initiatives, share\nrepurchases and dividend payments for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We\ncontinuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we\ncan finance our future capital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations\ninclude certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially\nchange our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in\nservers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $29.0 billion, which mature from 2027 through 2064. Short-term and long-term future interest\npayments obligations as of December 31, 2024 were $1.39 billion and $28.10 billion, respectively.\nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28\nbillion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\nDividend\nWe paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of Class A and\nClass B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were\n$5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by\nour board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents\non our outstanding common stock.\nTaxes\nCash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had\ntaxes payable of $718 million related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act,\nwhich is due within one year.\nOur long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024.\nDue to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions\nis uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any\nof these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results\nof operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n78\nTable of Contents\nSee Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, Note 13 — Stockholders'\nEquity, and Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item\n8, and \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation regarding leases, debt, contractual commitments and contingencies, capital return program, and taxes,\nrespectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

                "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\nprice risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to remeasuring monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other\nthan the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into,\nbut in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million were recognized in\n2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash\nequivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements.\nChanges in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt\nsecurities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest\nrates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and $355 million in the market value of our available-for-\nsale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any realized gains or\nlosses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur\nif we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes)\noutstanding of $29.0 billion and $18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are\ncarried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing\nin periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that\ncould have a material impact on the fair value or carrying value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities\nare publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies\nwithout readily determinable fair values.\n79\nTable of Contents\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks are subject to market price volatility and represent\n$1.23 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024. A hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our\nDecember 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $123 million. We did not\nhold any marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2023.\nWe elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available\nmarket data and observable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could\nadversely impact the valuation of the companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or\ndownward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities, which mostly consists of our\ninvestment in Jio Platforms Limited, had a carrying value of $6.07 billion and $6.14 billion as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Financial\nInstruments, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities, and Note 10 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and\nPart II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical\nAccounting Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n80\nTable of Contents"

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 29, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n82\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of these loss\ncontingencies was especially challenging due to the significant\njudgment required to evaluate management's assessments of the\nlikelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential amount or\nrange of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nOur audit procedures included reading the minutes or a summary of\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, reading\nthe proceedings, claims, and regulatory or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requesting\nand receiving internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, meeting with internal and external legal counsel to\ndiscuss the nature of the various matters, and obtaining\nrepresentations from management. We also evaluated the\nappropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 12 to\nthe consolidated financial statements.\n83\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2025\n84\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2025 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2025\n85\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Consolidated Financial Statements.\n91\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to build the future of human connection and the\ntechnology that makes it possible.\nWe report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nBalance Sheets Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to current period\npresentation.\nIntangible assets, net was reclassified into other assets\nPartners payable was reclassified into accrued expenses and other current liabilities\nLong-term income taxes was reclassified out of other liabilities\nThese reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenue, income\nfrom operations, net income or cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to loss contingencies,\nincome taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS)\ndebt securities and accounts receivable, and fair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are\nbased on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and expectations about actions\nwe may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, and\ndetermined we should extend the estimated useful lives to 5.5years. This change in accounting estimate will be\neffective beginning fiscal year 2025.\n92\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is\none year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We\ndo not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of\none year or less.\nRevenue includes sales and usage‑based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\nmobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers.\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and\nreport revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider\nif we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as\nother indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration for the reported periods.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI\nglasses, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred\nto customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects\nto be entitled to in exchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we\nreceive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These\nmainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee compensation which includes\npayroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist\nof cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.\n93\nTable of Contents\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee,\nor both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if\nthe capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not\nmaterial to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners\nbased on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Expensed content costs\nare included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for\ncapitalization were not material to date.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.06billion, $ 2.02billion, and $ 2.65billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n94\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid\ninvestments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We classify amounts in transit from\ncustomer credit cards and payment service providers as cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe hold investments in marketable debt securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable debt securities as\navailable-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for\ncurrent operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses,\nnet of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt\nsecurities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of\nthat difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities\nare recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income,\nand any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in\nstockholders' equity. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific\nidentification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income.\nWe also hold investments in marketable equity securities that are publicly traded stocks. We classify these equity\nsecurities as marketable securities within current assets on our consolidated balance sheets because they are\navailable to be converted into cash to fund current operations without any restriction. These marketable equity\nsecurities are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the resulted unrealized gains and losses\nrecognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, cash\nreserves designated for a specific purpose, as well as retention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions,\nwithin prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, based upon\nthe expected duration of the restrictions.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. We\nperiodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated\nfair value of an investment is below its carrying amount, we write down the investment to fair value. The change in\ncarrying value, resulted from the remeasurements, is recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income.For additional information, see Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were\nnot material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n95\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 or Level\n2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair values are derived from quoted market prices or alternative\npricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3\nbecause factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market\nactivity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on\na non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions\noccur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses on\naccounts receivable were not material.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the\nremaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets as of December 31, 2024 are described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           FourtoFive years(1)\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Fiveto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\n_______________________\n(1) Effective January 2025, the useful lives of certain servers and network assets are extended to 5.5years.\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are management's estimates when the assets are initially recognized\nand are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our estimate of useful lives represents the\nbest estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful\nlives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological\nadvancements. When we change the estimated\n96\nTable of Contents\nuseful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and\ndepreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nServers and network assets include equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support production\ntraffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to\nthe construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their\nintended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over\nthe useful life of the related assets.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale\nor disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases\nfor certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases\ncontain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities,\nreal estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a\nsingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common\narea maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price\nIndex, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and\nutilities. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain\ncolocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU\nassets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease\nterm unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any\nmaterial residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 , we recorded net impairment losses of $ 383million, $\n2.43billion, and $ 2.22billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold\nimprovements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values\nof the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market\nparticipant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected\ndowntime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods,\nand discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional\ninformation regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\n97\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses\nas general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the\nextent material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair\nvalue of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as\ngoodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase\nconsideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived\nintangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units, Family of Apps\n(FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2024, noimpairment of\ngoodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is not\nrecoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The\nimpairment charges of finite-lived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nIntangible assets are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive\n98\nTable of Contents\nincome (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cumulative\ntranslation losses, net of tax, of $ 2.66billion and $ 1.24billion, respectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 690million, $\n366million, and $ 81million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists\nmostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable debt\nsecurities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large\nfinancial institutions and our marketable debt securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our\ninvestment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The\namount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 36%, 37%, and 40% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with a majority of the\nrevenue outside of the United States in 2024 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil,\nAustralia, India and Canada.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nBeginning in 2024 annual reporting, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) that was issued by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (FASB). This new standard requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment\nexpenses on an annual and interim basis. Upon adoption, the guidance was applied retrospectively to all prior\nperiods presented in the financial statements, which resulted in the disclosure of employee compensation costs for\neach reportable segment. For additional information, see Note 16 — Segment and Geographical Information.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n(ASU 2023-09), which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and\ngreater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated\nby jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures.\nThis new standard will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. The new\nstandard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption\nof this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense\nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASU 2024-03). The new\nguidance requires disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and\ninterim basis. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2027 and\nfor interim periods thereafter. The new standard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or\nretrospectively. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements\nand related disclosures.\n99\nTable of Contents\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024          2023          2022\nAdvertising       $                  160,633    $  131,948    $  113,642\nOther revenue                          1,722         1,058           808\nFamily of Apps                       162,355       133,006       114,450\nReality Labs                           2,146         1,896         2,159\nTotal revenue     $                  164,501    $  134,902    $  116,609\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers, consists of the following (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024          2023          2022\nUnited States and Canada(1)    $                   63,207    $   52,888    $   50,150\nEurope(3)                                          38,361        31,210        26,681\nAsia-Pacific(2)                                    45,009        36,154        27,760\nRest of World(3)                                   17,924        14,650        12,018\nTotal revenue                  $                  164,501    $  134,902    $  116,609\n_________________________\n(1) United States revenue was $ 59.73billion, $ 49.78billion, and $ 47.20billion for the years ended December 31,\n2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(2) China revenue was $ 18.35billion, $ 13.69billion, and $ 7.40billion for the years ended December 31, 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(3) Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\nTotal deferred revenue was $ 772million and $ 675million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

These measures included a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon\nseveral office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000employees across the Family of\nApps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including\ncancellation of multiple data center projects (the 2022 Restructuring). As of December 31, 2024, we have completed\nthe 2022 restructuring initiatives.\nA summary of our 2022 Restructuring pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nincluding subsequent adjustments, is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024(1)        2023        2022\nCost of revenue               $                       31    $    -47    $  1,495\nResearch and development                             254       1,572       1,719\nMarketing and sales                                   54         395         638\nGeneral and administrative                            50         335         759\nTotal                         $                      389    $  2,255    $  4,611\n________________________\n(1) The 2024 charges are all related to facilities consolidation.\nPlan to Date\nFacilities       Severance and Other\nConsolidation           Personnel Costs       Data Center Assets       Total\nCost of revenue         $                    362    $                    —    $               1,116    $  1,478\nResearch and                               3,146                       399                        —       3,545\ndevelopment\nMarketing and sales                          854                       233                        —       1,087\nGeneral and                                  828                       316                        —       1,144\nadministrative\nTotal                   $                  5,190    $                  948    $               1,116    $  7,254\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $ 305million, $ 1.74billion, and $ 4.10billion, and\nRL segment were $ 84million, $ 516million and $ 515million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively.\n2023 Restructuring\nThe 2023 Restructuring charges for severance and related personnel costs were $ 1.20billion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.

Accordingly, we present the earnings per share (EPS) for Class A and\nClass B common stock together.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock\noutstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common\nstock outstanding and assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock.\nClass A common stock equivalent of restricted stock units (RSUs) with anti-dilutive effect were not material for\nthe year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, approximately 16million and\n95million shares of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have\nan anti-dilutive effect.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024       2023(2)       2022(2)\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nDistributed earnings                     $                    5,072    $        —    $        —\nUndistributed earnings                                       57,288        39,098        23,200\nNet income                               $                   62,360    $   39,098    $   23,200\nDenominator\nShares used in computation of basic                           2,534         2,574         2,687\nEPS(1)\nBasic EPS                                $                    24.61    $    15.19    $     8.63\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income for diluted EPS               $                   62,360    $   39,098    $   23,200\nDenominator\nShares used in computation of basic                           2,534         2,574         2,687\nEPS(1)\nEffect of dilutive RSUs                                          80            55            15\nShares used in computation of diluted                         2,614         2,629         2,702\nEPS\nDiluted EPS                              $                    23.86    $    14.87    $     8.59\n____________________________________\n(1) Includes 2,189million, 2,220million, and 2,285million shares of Class A common stock and 345million,\n354million, and 402million shares of Class B common stock, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively.\n(2) The prior period EPS for Class A and Class B common stock has been presented together to conform with current\nperiod presentation, which had no impact on our previously reported basic or diluted EPS.\nWe declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $ 2.00for each share\nof common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid for Class A\nand Class B common stock were $ 4.38billion and $ 691million, respectively, during the year ended December 31,\n2024.

For further information, see Legal and Related Matters in Note 12 —\nCommitments and Contingencies.\n109\nTable of Contents\nNote 12.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContractual Commitments\nWe have $ 32.82billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2024, which are primarily\nrelated to our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs. The following is a schedule,\nby years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n2025          $  26,335\n2026              2,548\n2027                812\n2028                227\n2029                153\nThereafter        2,749\nTotal         $  32,824\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase\nrenewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. We enter into these agreements in order\nto secure price. Using the expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend related to our renewable energy\nagreements as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $ 24.97billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years.\nThe ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on actual volume purchased.\nLegal and Related Matters\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described below, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. Unless\notherwise noted, with respect to the matters described below that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss\nor range of possible loss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not\nindividually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be\nuncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to\ncomply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these\nother legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and investigations, and other matters,\nasserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we\nbelieve a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of\nlosses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually\nor in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15 — Income Taxes.\n110\nTable of Contents\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United\nStates and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that\nshared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection,\nprivacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the\nparties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $ 725million by\nus. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023.\nTwoobjectors appealed final approval ( oneof which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is\nfully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as\nthe events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other\njurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took\neffect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion\nwhich was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general\ninquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023,\nthe court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment,\nresolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is\nfully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled\nto begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of\nChancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims\nrelating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20,\n2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action,\nasserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and\nofficers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending\nconsolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to\ndismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants\nexcept Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to\nbegin on April 2, 2025.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking\nsubstantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and\ninclude, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the\ncomposition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new\nproducts. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v.\nFacebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent\norder. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding\npending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying\nappeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to\npreliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed\nan opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024,\nthe district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the\nlitigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme\nCourt's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was\ndenied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a\nrenewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The\nparties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30days of the district court's disposition of the\nFTC's motion to dismiss.\n111\nTable of Contents\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the\nOrder to Show Cause proceeding was legally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal\nissues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners on those issues on November 12,\n2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to\nMeta’s jurisdictional challenges currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. , and that the nature and scope of any further administrative proceedings would\nbe addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the\nadditional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision\nmodifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order\nwhile the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue\nsimilar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of\nthe ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators\nregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the\ncompliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12,\n2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual\nClauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance\nwith the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR € 1.2billion as well as corrective orders, which is\ndescribed further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\ninterpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators\nas part of the GDPR's cooperation and consistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final\noutcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the\nimposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are\nvigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related\nto these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional\naccruals for losses related to these matters could be material individually or in the aggregate.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly\nreceived individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our\nterms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re\nMeta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor,\nInc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara County Superior Court). These cases\nare in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain\nothers have been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in\nthe cases that are most advanced.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\n2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a\npermanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,\nincluding divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion\nto dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended\ncomplaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our motion for summary\njudgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On\nNovember 13, 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC's motions for summary\njudgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state\nand federal courts in the United States\n112\nTable of Contents\nand in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection\nwith these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief.\nSeveral of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On\nJanuary 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions.\nOn March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf\nof certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated\ncomplaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 30, 2024, we\nfiled our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook\nMarketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18,\n2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102 on the Treaty of the Functioning of\nthe European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a\nfine of approximately EUR € 798million. We appealed the European Commission's decision on January 28, 2025.\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\"\nconsent model with requirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued\npreliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such\nrequirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook,\nInc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and\nuser data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the\nplaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their\ncase, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in\npart and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ\nof certiorari on March 4, 2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The\nSupreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2024, and following oral argument\nissued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages ( Ohio Pub.\nEmpl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with leave to\namend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed\nagainst us and certain of our current and former directors and officers.\n113\nTable of Contents\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages ( Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court\ndismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint and on September 17, 2024, the court dismissed the claims with prejudice. On October 14, 2024,\nplaintiffs filed their notice of appeal.\nYouth-Related Actions\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users, with most\nproceedings focused on those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class\nactions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and\nnumerous school districts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United\nStates, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were\ncentralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Social Media Adolescent\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation) . Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories\nbegan filing lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include\nallegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child sexual abuse\nmaterial and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business\npractices, public nuisance, and products liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices\n(including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and\ninjunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, as well as various state courts around the country. Beginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands\nof individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to “social media addiction” and related\nharms allegedly caused by Instagram.\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions\nglobally concerning the use of our products and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety\nimpacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings\nassessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and\nother vulnerable users that may stem from the design and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve\nv. Facebook, Inc. ) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and\n2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition\nclaims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March\n21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order granting\nclass certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was\ndenied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2,\n2024, which was denied.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nand Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee,\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al. , which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California) alleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our\nartificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. These cases have all been\nconsolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .\n114\nTable of Contents\nOn April 30, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings against us to assess Facebook and Instagram's\ncompliance with certain requirements under Articles 14, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 40 of the DSA, regarding a\nrange of topics including elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content\nrecommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified,\nassessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks on Instagram and Facebook. We are also responding to\nregulatory inquiries and litigation related to allegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to\nfinancial scams, in other parts of the world.\nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and\nOpportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products\nand services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the Director of the CFPB that the Bureau\ntake legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged\nreceipt and use for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as\nwell as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided us with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with\nthe claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded through the\nNORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action\nagainst us, the CFPB could file a lawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2024, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. Liabilities recorded for costs\nrelated to indemnification through December 31, 2024 were not material.\n115\nTable of Contents\nNote 13.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. The holder of each\nshare of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is\nentitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our\nClass A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial\nstatements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 2,190million shares of Class A common stock and 344million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2023, $ 30.93billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2024, an additional $ 50billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for an aggregate amount of $ 29.75billion, which includes the 1% excise tax accruals as a result of\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2024, $ 51.28billion remained available and authorized for\nrepurchases.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDividend\nBeginning in February 2024, our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.50per share to the\nholders of our Class A and Class B common stock. RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2024 under our 2012 Equity\nIncentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in May 2024, are entitled to dividend\nequivalent rights. During the year ended December 31, 2024, total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $\n4.38billion and $ 691million for Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.\nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to\ncontinue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future\ndividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including\nour financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.\nShare-based Compensation Plan\nWe have oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which\nwas most recently amended in May 2024. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and\nnonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock\nbonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net\nsettlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 483million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance\nunder our Amended 2012 Plan.\n116\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our share-based compensation expense, which consists of the RSU expense, by line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024         2023         2022\nCost of revenue               $                    1,055    $     740    $     768\nResearch and development                          13,683       11,429        9,361\nMarketing and sales                                1,026          952        1,004\nGeneral and administrative                           926          906          859\nTotal                         $                   16,690    $  14,027    $  11,992\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)                                    Per Share\nUnvested at December 31, 2023             149,062    $                                  209.85\nGranted                                    48,661    $                                  506.80\nVested                                    -64,769    $                                  250.76\nForfeited                                 -10,322    $                                  255.04\nUnvested at December 31, 2024             122,632    $                                  302.27\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nwas $ 202.46and $ 195.66, respectively.

We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $ 595million, which will begin to expire in\n2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit carryforwards of $ 5.47billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization.

During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income. The\namount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $ 2.21billion, $ 1.48billion,\nand $ 1.07billion, respectively.\nIf our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 15.13billion as of December 31, 2024 were realized in a future period,\nthis would result in a tax benefit of $ 10.11billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax years. Our 2014 through 2016 tax\nyears are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination by the IRS. We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our\n2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in\nAugust 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2025 which will likely provide a transfer pricing value\nfor intellectual property transferred. This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine\nthe specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will not be resolved until the Tax Court enters\na decision. If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability\nof an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally\nfiled U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. Once the Tax Court decision is entered, the IRS and\nMeta will each have the option to file an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2024, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional\ntax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n120\nTable of Contents\nNote 16. Segment and Geographical Information\nWe report our financial results for our tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA\nincludes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes our virtual, augmented, and\nmixed reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. Our operating segments are the same as our\nreportable segments.\nOur chief executive officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM), who allocates resources to and assesses\nthe performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss)\nfrom operations. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include\ncertain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer\nhardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a\nreasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating\nsegments. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and\ndevelopment activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses are mostly allocated based on headcount. Costs\nrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure are generally allocated to our segments\nbased on estimated usage, most of which is allocated to the FoA segment.\nBeginning in 2024 annual reporting, we adopted ASU 2023-07 retrospectively.

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules\nand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nour management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2024 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs."
