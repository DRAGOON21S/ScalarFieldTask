                "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku”, “the Company”, “we” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S. by hours\nstreamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV and were founded on the belief that all TV content will be streamed. The re-\nplatforming of the TV ecosystem is underway and is creating more options for consumers, content publishers,\nadvertisers and other industry participants. TV streaming is now mainstream and consumers are spending more time\nwatching TV streaming services, with many ‘cutting the cord’ from legacy pay TV services entirely. Over the past\nseveral years, many of the biggest names in media have transitioned toward streaming offerings and similarly,\nadvertisers looking to reach and engage with streaming audiences are increasingly taking advantage of the benefits\ninherent to the digital advertising capabilities of TV streaming platforms and are re-allocating their budgets\naccordingly. These trends continued to gain momentum in 2020 as consumers spent more time at home due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nOur Strategy\nOur mission is to be the streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem of viewers, content publishers\nand advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we are focused on connecting consumers to the entertainment\nthey love, enabling content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and providing advertisers with unique\ncapabilities to engage consumers. Central to our platform is the Roku operating system (the “Roku OS”). The Roku OS\nis purpose built for TV and designed to run on low-cost hardware which allows us to manufacture and sell streaming\nplayers that are affordable. The Roku OS also powers Roku TV models that are manufactured and sold by our TV brand\npartners who license the Roku OS and leverage our smart TV hardware reference designs. Roku TV models and Roku\nstreaming players enable consumers to access a wide selection of content by connecting their Roku device to our\nstreaming platform via a home broadband network.\nThe features and functionality of our platform, powered by the Roku OS, enable us to address the needs of our\nconsumers, content publishers, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners, and other partners. Consumers can discover and\naccess a wide variety of streaming content, content publishers can reach our highly-engaged user base of over 50\nmillion active accounts and utilize our billing services and data insight tools, advertisers can serve targeted and\nmeasurable ads to the TV viewers that they want to reach, Roku TV brand partners can build market share by offering\nhigh performance smart TVs in a range of sizes and price points, and retailers can offer customers Roku’s highly-\nrated streaming devices on-line and in stores. We continue to invest significant resources to advance the Roku OS;\nto provide an industry-leading platform for our consumers, content publishers, and advertisers; and to extend\nRoku’s advantage as the streaming decade continues.\nOur Business Model\nThree core areas of focus define our business model. First, we build scale by increasing our active accounts.\nSecond, we increase engagement by growing the hours of content streamed through our platform. And third, we\nmonetize the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Furthermore, our business model is designed\nto fulfill the needs of the participants in the TV streaming ecosystem: consumers, content publishers, advertisers,\nTV OEMs, other device licensees and consumer electronics retailers.\nScale: Increasing the number of active accounts\nWe make TV streaming affordable by offering a lineup of stand-alone streaming players that connect to a user’s TV.\nFurthermore, to enhance our users’ experience and to provide a better audio experience we also offer our Roku Smart\nSoundbars and Roku Streambars, each with a streaming player built in that enables the soundbar to connect to our\nstreaming platform, Roku wireless speakers that connect to Roku TV models, and our Roku Wireless Subwoofers. We\nlaunch new devices and provide updates via the Roku OS periodically to ensure they offer the highest performance at\nan affordable price.\n5\nWe also partner with TV brands that manufacture and sell co-branded Roku TV models that integrate the Roku OS to\nenable basic TV functions and connect to our TV streaming platform. We have driven strong growth in our Roku TV\nlicensing program. Using our reference designs results in relatively low hardware costs, enabling these TV brand\nlicensees to manufacture and sell smart TVs that are competitively priced for consumers and that are automatically\nupdated whenever we issue a Roku OS update.\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telco service operators that distribute co-branded players to their\nsubscribers in their markets.\nTaken together, we offer consumers tremendous optionality and value when it comes to gaining access to the Roku\nplatform, and combined with the exceptional user experience. We have been able to significantly scale our active\naccount base over a multi-year period. In 2020, we added over 14 million active accounts, ending the year with 51.2\nmillion active accounts.\nEngagement: Growing streaming hours\nWe believe that offering users a wide range of content drives increased user engagement by delivering a better\noverall streaming experience. Streaming hours on our platform have grown from 37.8 billion hours in 2019 to 58.7\nbillion hours in 2020, as we have grown active accounts through the distribution of Roku streaming players and Roku\nTV models, and as our active accounts stream more hours per day, on average.\nThrough our streaming platform and our streaming devices, we make it easy and affordable for our users to watch\ntheir favorite TV shows and movies, as well as listen to streaming audio. Furthermore, we believe our platform\noffers users an incredible streaming experience through a user interface that is easy to use and navigate. From the\nRoku home screen, our users can easily find and access the 500,000+ free and paid movies and TV episodes including\nlive TV, news, sports, hit movies, popular shows, and more that are available from the thousands of channels on our\nstreaming platform. And Roku’s powerful cross-channel search capabilities make it simple for our users to find the\nentertainment they’re looking for. Users have the optionality to align their spend to their budget by choosing\ncontent that is available on an ad-supported, subscription, or transactional basis. Our direct relationship with\nour users provides us with detailed insights about our users and their behavior on our platform, including certain\ncontent they search for, the channels they install, the channels they watch, and certain content that they purchase\nor subscribe to on our platform. Our first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content\nrecommendations to improve our users’ experience.\nWe enable our content partners to publish streaming channels, quickly and easily, which makes us an attractive\nplatform for content publishers to partner with as they seek to reach TV streaming, or over-the-top (“OTT”), users.\nContent publishers can deliver content directly to our large and relevant audiences and reach those users who no\nlonger use or those who never used legacy pay TV or paid TV subscriptions. As consumers shift to TV streaming,\ncontent publishers that use our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage users\ndirectly.\nThe Roku Channel is our own streaming channel that drives user engagement on our platform by providing our users\nfree, ad-supported access to a large library of third-party content that we directly license, in addition to\ncontent made available through The Roku Channel by our content publishers. In this way, The Roku Channel also is\nintended to help content publishers drive additional viewership and maximize the value of their content on our\nplatform. The Roku Channel is available in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. In 2020, in the U.S., we added a line-up of\nmore than 100 free live/linear channels on the Roku Channel and introduced a new Live TV Channel Guide, offering\nusers a convenient way to discover and watch live TV.\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe believe that running relevant display and digital ads enhances the user experience on our platform. We generate\nrevenue by monetizing our users’ engagement on our platform through a variety of services and capabilities,\nincluding video advertising in ad supported channels, sales of subscription services and other commerce\ntransactions, brand sponsorship and promotions, and billing services. Each individual user on our platform creates\nmultiple revenue opportunities for Roku, whether they’re purchasing content, enjoying ad-supported content or\nsimply opening the Roku home page. We measure monetization of our platform by calculating the average revenue per\nuser (“ARPU”), which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model, and growth in gross profit. In\n2020, ARPU (which we measure\n6\non a trailing twelve-month basis) increased from $23.14 to $28.76 and gross profit for the full year grew from\n$495.2 million to $808.2 million.\nOur sophisticated and leading streaming platform enables advertisers, including content publishers, brands and\nagencies, to reach audiences that are no longer reachable or are increasingly unavailable through advertising on\ntraditional TV. We make it easy for content publishers to distribute and monetize their streaming content through\nthree primary business models: transaction video on demand (“TVOD”), subscription video on demand (“SVOD”), and\nadvertising-supported video on demand (“AVOD”). Through our platform we are also able to assist content partners\nwith billing services, including billing customers for in-channel purchases like a movie rental, managing\nsubscriptions and customer invoices. Roku Pay, our platform billing solution, is a key platform capability that\nsimplifies consumer subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for partners.\nContent publishers also have access to our promotional and audience development tools to help them attract and\nretain viewers. Content publishers can use a variety of ad placements, including native display ads on the Roku\nhome screen or a screen saver to drive channel downloads, promote a channel’s content, and direct traffic to their\nchannels in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also sell branded channel buttons on\nstreaming player and Roku TV remote controls that are intended to increase incremental usage of the channel by\nallowing users to launch straight into the channel from the home screen. Our analytics and reporting assist content\npublishers with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles. Using machine learning, we also can\nhelp content publishers target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe to their services.\nThe Roku Channel provides monetization for both our content partners and Roku through digital advertising. The Roku\nChannel provides our users with free access to over 50,000 titles, including hit Hollywood movies, TV episodes,\nnews channels, and more and is a leading sources of advertising inventory. Through Premium Subscriptions within The\nRoku Channel, we resell ad-free premium content subscription services from providers such as Showtime, Starz, and\nEpix directly to our users. In addition, we have developed and implemented various features within The Roku Channel\nthat can be used to recruit and retain subscribers for Premium Subscription. For example, we provide personalized\ncontent selection for users and integrated The Roku Channel into our billing services to enable one-click\nsubscriptions.\nAdvertisers are able to use our platform to leverage our direct relationship with our users, as well as our\nadvertising capabilities and user data and insights, to serve relevant, targeted advertisements. Advertisers on our\nplatform also can measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their return on investment. We offer\nengagement analytics such as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We work with a\nwide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and audience\ndemographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform. Furthermore, we\nhave relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data, which enables our\nadvertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on traditional TV. Additional\npromotional advertising opportunities include content sponsorships to give users the opportunity to experience a\nfree movie or show and sponsored themes on our home screen. We also sell branded content rows within The Roku\nChannel.\nIn May 2020, we announced the rebranding of the OneView Ad Platform, a single platform leveraging TV identity data\nto manage advertising across OTT, desktop, and mobile campaigns. As consumers move to TV streaming, OneView\nprovides advertisers with a toolset to scale their OTT advertising and marketers self-serve capabilities to\noptimize and measure effectiveness across screens. OneView integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of\nRoku advertising with the identity and attribution tools of demand-side platform dataxu, which the company acquired\nin November 2019.\nInternational Markets\nWe believe that the value our business delivers to participants in the TV ecosystem in the U.S. — consumers,\ncontent publishers, advertisers, TV OEMs, other device licensees, and retailers — is also compelling in\ninternational markets. To date, we have brought the same business model to certain markets that has enabled us to\ndevelop the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. by hours streamed. In 2020, Roku TV was the No. 1 selling smart\nTV operating system in Canada. Also, in 2020, we launched in Brazil, first in partnership with AOC to bring the AOC\nRoku TV to consumers and then with the launch of Roku Express, our first streaming device in the country. In these\nnewer markets, we will continue to focus on building scale, increasing engagement, and ultimately driving\nmonetization.\n7\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously drive scale, engagement, and\nmonetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily\nfocused on building and expanding relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, retailers and\nservice operators, and driving sales of our streaming players and audio products and Roku TV models to consumers\nthrough retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships, to promote and build\nawareness of the features and advantages of the Roku platform among content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform\nto increase effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing\ncampaigns. We enter into distribution agreements with our content publishers and license their content through our\ndedicated content relationship management team. Our relationship with content publishers is typically client-\ndirect. We secure direct access to publishers’ video ad inventory as part of our distribution agreements and serve\nas an additional channel for content publishers to monetize their audience. These sales efforts are differentiated\nand complementary to that of our content publishers. Whereas our publishers typically sell on a cross-platform\nbasis and feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large OTT audience across many\nchannels at once. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their goals across numerous\nkey performance indicators. Our sales teams and products are organized into six groups that specialize in the\nunique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and mid-\nmarket clients, (iii) content publishers and entertainment brands, (iv) performance and direct to consumer brands,\n(v) international markets and (vi) local advertising.\nWe work with our Roku TV brand partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\ndevelopment, planning, manufacturing and marketing. Similarly, we work with service operators on the planning and\ndevelopment of their co-branded players.\nIn the United States, the majority of our streaming players, audio products and Roku TV models are sold through\ntraditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target and Walmart, including their online sales\nplatforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website. We also sell products\ninternationally through distributors and to retailers. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nsales through Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our player segment revenue. These\nthree retailers collectively accounted for 69% and 72% of our player segment revenue for the years ended December\n31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and work closely\nwith these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting. We intend to continue to invest\nsignificant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and streaming player sales. Our\nrevenue and gross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, a significant percentage of our player sales through retailers in the fourth\nquarter of the fiscal year are pursuant to committed sales agreements with retailers for which we recognize\nsignificant discounts in the average selling prices in the third quarter in an effort to grow our active accounts,\nwhich will reduce our player gross margin.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, audio\nproducts, TVs, features and functionality. We work closely with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development process that\ncaptures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features\nand enhancements to the Roku platform.\n8\nWe intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and\nenhance our platform and capabilities.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. All\nof our products are manufactured by our contract manufacturers in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asia\nand Brazil. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific\nprice. Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish\nbased upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions. The contract\nmanufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in California, the United Kingdom and Brazil where\nthey ship players directly to retailers, wholesale distributors and to end users.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our devices and platform are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations\ncovering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business regulations and\nlaws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of Internet-delivered streaming services and Internet-\nconnected devices. New laws and regulations in these areas may have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of\ncompliance with these laws and regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance\nwith existing or future laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and\nonline services, data privacy and security, consumer protection, global trade, employee health and safety, and\ntaxes, could have an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and\nregulations, we may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nIn particular, our business is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations applicable to companies\nconducting business using the Internet. Both domestic and foreign jurisdictions vary widely as to how, or whether,\nexisting laws governing areas such as privacy and data security, online platform liability, consumer protection,\npayment processing or sales and other taxes and intellectual property apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and\nthese laws are continually evolving. Moreover, the laws governing these areas, as well as those governing\nelectronic contracts and Internet content and access restrictions, among other areas, are rapidly evolving. The\nlaws in these areas are unsettled and future developments are unpredictable. Laws that lead to more stringent\nregulation of companies engaging in businesses using the Internet may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn the United States, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues is rapidly evolving. State and\nfederal consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer privacy protections and the\nsecurity of online services. For example, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018\n(“CCPA”), which gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal\ninformation, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their\npersonal information is used. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy\nlegislation. State laws may also impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent\ndisclosure of personal information. Foreign jurisdictions impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer\nand privacy protections, including the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR\nbroadly regulates the processing of personal information about individuals in the EU and includes significant\npenalties for non-compliance. Such consumer privacy laws are constantly changing and may become more diverse and\nrestrictive over time, challenging our ability to fully comply with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws\nalso may limit the ability of advertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our\nbusiness.\nTax regulations in domestic and international jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes\nmay subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, to additional taxes or to requirements intended\nto assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws\nfrom jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and\nregulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business.\nAn increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose\nnew tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and\nservices. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online\nmarketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result\n9\nin liability for third-party obligations. For example, Maryland recently passed legislation establishing a tax on\ncertain advertising activities and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, including member states\nof the EU have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of\noperations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us\nprospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any\ncollection obligations. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and\nregulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies, and any such developments could harm\nour business.\nIn addition, the Internet is a vital component of our business and also is subject to a variety of laws and\nregulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. We expect to rely on the historical openness and accessibility\nof the Internet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede or fail to preserve the open\nInternet could harm our business. To the extent regulatory agencies adopt rules that allow network operators to\nrestrict the flow of content over the Internet, such operators may seek to extract fees from us or our content\npublishers to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in blocking, throttling or other discriminatory practices\nwith respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur content publishers also are subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nBecause our business depends on the availability of third-party content delivered over the Internet, increased\nregulation of our content publishers or changes in laws or regulations governing Internet retransmission of third-\nparty content could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 195 issued patents and 200 pending applications in the United States\nand foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our product\nofferings or business.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face aggressive\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on our ability to acquire users by delivering high quality streaming devices at competitive prices,\npartnering with Roku TV brands to bring co-branded smart TVs to market, and developing and monetizing our streaming\nplatform with compelling content, promotional services and advertising.\nOur competitors include:\nlegacy pay TV service operators;\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with our streaming players and Roku TV models and\ncompanies that license their operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs and well as other devices like game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms, that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach consumers on other content and advertising\nmediums; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices that may be better able attract and retain top\ntalent in engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations and other organizations.\n10\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop newproducts and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S. by hours streamed, we believe our success depends on our culture\nand our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,925 full-\ntime employees located in nine countries. Only our employees in Brazil are represented by a labor union with\nrespect to their employment. The majority of our employees currently are working remotely as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution focused culture focuses on\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork and expecting our employees to perform at a high level.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, leadership communicates plans, milestones and strategic context broadly, and\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to use our\nbroad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nRoku is committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. We follow through on this commitment through our\nannual pay equity analysis designed to ensure we pay fairly and equitably across gender and ethnicity, year over\nyear; our hiring and management trainings that incorporate topics on mitigating unconscious bias; and by having\ndiverse interviews panel that limit questions to those that are legally compliant and objectively tied to\napplicable job openings.\nDuring 2020, we furthered our commitment to diversity and inclusion by promoting a new Vice President of Inclusion\nStrategy and Talent Development who is building a growing team that is focusing on priorities in four key areas:\nInclusive Employee Experiences, Inclusive Recruiting, Inclusive Communities & Social Impact, and Inclusive Customer\nAdvocacy.\nInclusive Employee Experiences: Among other initiatives, we have launched an Employee Resource Group (ERG) Program\nand are currently developing seven ERGs. We also launched a series of educational employee-led dialogues that cover\nvarious topics of diversity ranging from ethnic diversity to neurodiversity and are providing diversity and\ninclusion training and curriculum in the areas of bias, leading diverse teams, and sourcing diverse talent.\nInclusive Recruiting:Every member of our recruiting team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit qualified\ndiverse candidates. In fact, all recruiters are equipped to discuss a diverse hiring strategy with every hiring\nmanager to ensure we continue to widen the candidate pipeline for all roles. Our University Recruiting and Intern\nprograms weave diversity and inclusion into their strategies so that we are recruiting not only from diverse\nschools but also diverse clubs and programs across all schools. Our external relationships also are focused on\norganizations that represent diverse communities, including technical and non-technical women and ethnic minority\norganizations, as well as professional Veteran’s networks, to enable our hiring managers and recruiters to attend\nor speak at diverse conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story to a wider audience.\nInclusive Communities & Social Impact:We are in the process of developing new social impact programs to support\nemployees and Roku in volunteerism, charitable activities, and youth engagement and anticipate we will have more to\nshare related to our commitment to leaving a positive impact on young people and our wider community in future\nperiods.\nInclusive Customer Advocacy:As a TV streaming platform for viewers in the U.S. and certain international locations,\nwe want to reflect our users in our overall user experience and accessibility, content we license, and the channel\non our platform. During 2020, we launched a policy designed to acknowledge key areas of diversity and identity\nthoughtfully, meaningfully, and inclusive of our diverse customer base, year-round.\nTraining & Employee Development\nOur Learning and Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to support\nour growth. Our employee training programs begin with a comprehensive New Hire Orientation that covers our\n11\nculture and business. Our Orientation is supplemented by checklists and resources for an employee’s first 90 days.\nIn addition to mandatory training covering Anti-Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, and Privacy trainings, we offer\nemployees a highly encouraged suite of training offerings such as Effective Feedback, Effective Meetings, and\nCommunication and Presentation Skills. Managers also are provided an additional set of trainings on Expectations\nfor Managers, Interviewing and Hiring, and Performance Management to support new and newly promoted leaders in how\nto manage and lead effectively. Our employees also have free access to additional training in technical and non-\ntechnical subjects through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase and/or custom\nbuild additional training materials to support the performance and development needs of our global employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation, we consider what they would be paid by another\nemployer, what we would have to pay to replace them it they leave Roku, and the amount we would pay to retain them.\nWe pay employees total compensation that is comprised of salary and equity awards rather than offer specific\nbenefits or perks that might be valued differently by different employees. We do not pay cash bonuses or have\nperformance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level regardless of\npossible bonus payouts or awards.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as\nsoon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities\nExchange Commission (“SEC”).

competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content owners and\naggregators, TV brands and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to differentiate\nourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users\nand our business will be harmed.\nTV streaming is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting and retaining users on,\nand effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need to be able to respond\nefficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to the content they love on\nterms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features and functionality of\nour streaming platform for users, content publishers and advertisers. We also must effectively support popular\nsources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Discovery+,\nHBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, Netflix and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in\nthe TV streaming industry.\nCompanies such as Amazon, Apple and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with our streaming players. In\naddition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart TVs and service provider\nset-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into smart TVs. These companies\nhave greater financial resources than we do and can subsidize the cost of their streaming devices in order to\npromote their other products and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing\nusers and increase streaming hours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not\ncompatible with our products or that provide a better streaming experience. These companies also promote their\nbrands through traditional forms of advertising, such as TV commercials, as well as digital advertising or website\nproduct placement, and have greater resources to devote to such efforts than we do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles and many DVD and Blu-ray players, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service\noperators offer TV streaming applications as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing\nconsumer bases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks and name recognition to gain traction in the TV\nstreaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to our streaming players and our\npartners' Roku TV models, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours,\nrevenue, gross profit or ARPU.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing\npressure, lower revenue and gross profit or the failure of our players, Roku TV models or our platform to gain or\nmaintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading TV streaming\nplatform we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and support and\ndevice distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards such as 8K, HDR and unknown future\ndevelopments may require further investments in the development of our players, Roku TV models, and our platform.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive\nposition. In addition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger\ncustomer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than us, which\nprovide them with advantages in developing, marketing or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they\nmay be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sales\nand distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products better than\nwe can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards and\nmay be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our sales volume,\nrevenue and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nIn July 2018, we introduced our Roku TV Wireless Speakers, designed specifically for use with Roku TV models, in\nSeptember 2019, we launched our Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Wireless Subwoofer and in September 2020, we launched\nour Roku Streambar. As a result of these developments, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio\nspeakers and soundbars, as well as makers of other TV peripheral devices. While our audio products have not\ngenerated material amounts of revenue, if these products do not operate as designed or do not enhance the Roku TV\nor other viewing experience as we intend, our users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may\nimpact the overall demand for Roku TV models or our other products.\n15\nWe also compete for video viewing hours with mobile platforms (phones and tablets), and users may prefer to view\nstreaming content on such devices. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming could adversely\nimpact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position and otherwise harm our business.\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of OTT advertising and OTT advertising platforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and we compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, as well as traditional media, such as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV,\nand satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content and other advertising mediums that may be more\nattractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These competitors are often very large and have more\nadvertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may adversely affect our ability to compete for\nadvertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from advertising. If we are unable to increase our\nrevenue from advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to further\noptimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns, increase our advertising inventory and expand our advertising sales\nteam and programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be harmed. We may not be able to\ncompete effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising\nrevenue and harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,\nsuch as linear TV, radio and print. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising, and\non advertisers increasing their spend on advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers showed\ngrowing interest in OTT advertising during 2020, we cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase\nor that they will not revert to traditional TV advertising, especially if our users no longer stream TV or\nsignificantly reduce the amount of TV they stream either as a result of lifting of stay-at-home orders, the end of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons. If advertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive\nmeaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely\nimpact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from advertising and audience development campaigns that run across our\nstreaming platform and from content distribution services. As such, we are seeking to expand the number of active\naccounts and increase the number of hours that are streamed across our platform in an effort to create additional\nplatform revenue opportunities. As our user base grows and as we increase the amount of content offered and\nstreamed across our platform, we must effectively monetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The\ntotal number of streaming hours, however, does not correlate with platform revenue on a period-by-period basis,\nprimarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed on our platform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform\nare measured whenever a player or a Roku TV is streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For\nexample, if a player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps away or falls asleep and does not\nstop or pause the player then the particular streaming channel may continue to play content for a period of time\ndetermined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming\ndevices and other set-top boxes. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the first quarter of 2020, we\nupdated the Roku OS with a feature that is designed to identify when content has been continuously streaming on a\nchannel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This feature,which we refer to as “Are you still\nwatching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the selected channel and closes\nthe channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across\nthe Roku platform benefits us, our customers, channel partners and advertisers. Some of our leading channel\npartners, including Netflix, also have similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature supplements\nthese channel features. This feature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial\nperformance.\nOur ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or\nprevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect personal viewing\ndata or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to\ncollect data regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our\nlegal obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing\ndata from many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users. Other\nchannels available on our platform, such\n16\nas Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu and YouTube, are focused on increasing user engagement and time spent within\ntheir channel by allowing users to purchase additional content and streaming services within their channels. In\naddition, we do not currently monetize content provided on non-certified channels, which are not displayed in our\nchannel store and must be added manually by the user, on our streaming platform. If our users spend most of their\ntime within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user\ninformation, or users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant advertisements,\nwe may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit. If we are unable to further\nmonetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising,\nwe will need our users to stream significantly more ad-supported content. Our efforts to monetize our streaming\nplatform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not continue to grow as we expect. Further,\nwhile we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in our revenue from advertising, our\nefforts to monetize our streaming platform through the distribution of AVOD content are still developing and our\nadvertising revenue may not grow as we expect. This means of monetization will require us to continue to attract\nadvertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver AVOD content that appeals to users. Accordingly,\nthere can be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution\nof ad-supported content.\nIf we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView Ad Platform or if we are not\nsuccessful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.\nIn 2020, we announced the rebranding of the OneView Ad Platform, a demand-side platform through which advertisers\nand advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage their OTT, desktop and mobile advertising\ncampaigns. OneView leverages the DSP developed by dataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the\nreach, inventory and capabilities of our proprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic\nOTT ad buying is an emerging market, and our current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not\nshift to programmatic ad buying from other buying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for\nprogrammatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or develops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising\nagencies may not use OneView or we may not attract prospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and\nour business could be harmed. In addition, we have limited experience running a DSP and if OneView does not have\nthe functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be able to attract their\nadvertising spend to OneView or our existing customers may not maintain or increase their spend on OneView. If we\nfail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to our customers evolving needs, advertisers and advertising\nagencies will not adopt OneView and our business may be harmed. We also may not be able to compete effectively with\nmore established DSPs or be able to adapt to changes or trends in programmatic OTT advertising, which would harm\nour ability to grow our advertising revenue and harm our business.\nOur growth will depend in part on our ability to develop and expand our relationships with TV brand partners in the\nUnited States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service operators.\nWe have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand partners and, to a\nlesser extent, service operators in both the United States and international markets. Our licensing arrangements\nare complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential partners include TV brands,\ncable and satellite companies and telecommunication providers. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion of\nour Roku TV program both in the United States and International markets. Our licensing program for service\noperators has historically been primarily focused on international markets and has not been growing in scale in\nrecent years, as we have shifted the focus of our international growth to the sale of Roku streaming players and\nRoku TV models.\nIn the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our TV brand partners has materially contributed to our active\naccount growth, to our streaming hours, and to our platform monetization efforts. This growth has primarily been in\nthe United States; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to certain international markets. We\nlicense the Roku OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand partners to manufacture co-branded smart\nTVs. We have not received, nor do we expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we expect to\nincur expenses in connection with these commercial agreements. The primary economic benefits that we derive from\nthese license arrangements have been and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily from growing our active\naccounts, increasing streaming hours and generating advertising-related revenues on our platform. If these\narrangements do not continue to\n17\nresult in increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth does not in turn lead to successfully\nmonetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of a relationship with a TV brand or service operator could harm our results of operations, damage our\nreputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from other partners and distribution channels, or increase\nour marketing costs. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with any of\nthese third parties, or if we encounter technological, content licensing or other impediments to our development of\nthese relationships, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nUnder these license arrangements, we generally have limited control over the amount and timing of resources these\nentities dedicate to the relationship. If our TV brand or service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts\nfor distributing licensed streaming devices, or chose to deploy competing streaming solutions within their product\nlines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed\non our platform. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the top three streaming services represented over 50% of all\nhours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically streamed a\nlarge percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, active accounts or\nstreaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming channels and popular content. In order to remain competitive, we must\nconsistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels and content; particularly as we launch new players,\nnew Roku TV models are introduced, or we enter new markets, including international markets. If we are not\nsuccessful in helping our content publishers launch and maintain streaming channels that attract and retain a\nsignificant number of users on our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner,\nour business will be harmed. Our ability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel\nofferings on a cost-effective basis largely depends on our ability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including pay TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream certain\nchannels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of popular\nstreaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand their\naudiences on the Roku platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nMost of our agreements with content publishers are not long term and can be terminated by the content publishers\nunder certain circumstances. Any disruption in the renewal of such agreements may result in the removal of certain\nchannels from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates. Our agreements with content publishers generally have terms of one to three years and can be\nterminated before the end of the term by the content publisher under certain circumstances, such as if we\nmaterially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy, commit fraud or fail to adhere to the content\npublishers’ security or other platform certification requirements. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are\nrequired to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing content from these content publishers on our\nstreaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future may not be able, to reach a satisfactory\nagreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements have expired. If we are unable to renew\nsuch agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, we may be required to temporarily or permanently\nremove certain channels from our streaming platform. The loss of such channels from our streaming platform for any\nperiod of time may harm our business. More broadly, if we fail to\n18\nmaintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if these content\npublishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may lose channel partners or users and\nour business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell\nour available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel serves as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to sell, we are also\ndependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may\nfail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on\nour streaming platform, or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform\nvaries greatly among channels; accordingly, we do not have access to all of the video ad inventory on our platform.\nFor certain channels, including YouTube’s ad supported channel, we have no access to video ad inventory at this\ntime, and we may not secure access in the future. The amount, quality and cost of video ad inventory available to\nus can change at any time. If we are unable to grow and maintain a sufficient supply of quality video ad inventory\nat reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our business may be harmed.\nIf our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected\nnot to participate in our cross-channel search feature, our integrated advertising framework, or have imposed\nlimits on our data gathering for usage within their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our\nproprietary Brightscript scripting language in order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels\non our streaming platform. If we introduce new features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a\nchange may not comply with our content publishers' certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers\nmay find other languages, such as HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing\ntheir channels on other platforms. If content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive\nto develop channels for, do not value and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming\nplatform offers, or determine that our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their\ncertification requirements, our business may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and audience development campaigns and other promotional advertising on our platform are not\nrelevant or not engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver\nrelevant advertisement, audience development campaigns and other promotional advertising to our users. Existing and\nprospective advertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and audience development\ncampaigns and sponsoring other promotional advertising that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and\ncampaigns may seem irrelevant, repetitive or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance\nthe objectives of our advertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but\nwe may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers and content\npublishers. If we do not introduce relevant advertisers, audience development campaigns and other promotional\nadverting or such advertisements, audience development campaigns and other promotional advertising are overly\nintrusive and impede the use of our streaming platform, our users may stop using our platform which will harm our\nbusiness.\nThe Roku Channel may not continue to attract a large number of users and/or generate significant revenue from\nadvertising, and our users may not purchase Premium Subscriptions.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers both ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films,\ntelevision series and other content as well as Premium Subscriptions, which allowing our users to pay for ad-free\ncontent from various content publishers, all on one streaming channel. We have incurred, and will continue to\nincur, costs and expenses in connection with the development, expansion and operation of The Roku Channel, which we\nmonetize primarily through advertising. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we acquired global content\ndistribution rights, including rights to certain projects in development, from the mobile-first video distribution\nservice known as Quibi, and announced\n19\nthat The Roku Channel will become the home of such content.If our users do not continue to stream the free, ad-\nsupported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not have the opportunity to monetize The Roku\nChannel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract users to the ad-supported content on The\nRoku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku Channel, we must secure rights to stream content\nthat is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do this by directly licensing certain content from\ncontent owners, such as television and movie studios. The agreements that we enter into with these content owners\nhave varying terms and provide us with rights to make specific content available through The Roku Channel during\ncertain periods of time. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these\nagreements with the content owners, or enter into new agreements with other content owners, in order to obtain\nrights to distribute additional titles or to extend the duration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable\nto enter into content license agreements on acceptable terms to access content that enables us to attract and\nretain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream,\nincluding for example the content that we acquired through theQuibitransaction described above, is ultimately not\nappealing to our users and advertisers, usage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.\nFurthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not relevant to our users or such advertisements are\noverly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available content, our users may not stream content and\nview advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not generate sufficient revenue from advertising\nto be cost effective for us to operate, regardless of our ability to sell Premium Subscriptions. In addition, we\ndistribute The Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that\nwe will be successful in attracting a large number of users and/or generating significant revenue from advertising\nthrough the distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,\nour business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our\nplatform. If users do not use our platform for these purchases or subscriptions for any reason, and instead pay for\nservices directly with content publishers or by other means that we do not receive attribution for, our business\nmay be harmed. In addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming\nservices from within their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is generally not equivalent to the\nrevenue we earn from activations on or through our platform that we receive full attribution credit for.\nFurthermore, for Premium Subscriptions, we only earn revenue for SVOD channels, including subscriptions to these\nservices through The Roku Channel. Accordingly, if users activate subscriptions for SVOD channels, including\nchannels available as Premium Subscriptions, other than on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that our outside of our control,\nwhich makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nTV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth\nand profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming\nplatform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an\nentertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access,\nthe quality of broadband content delivery, the quality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for\nusers relative to other sources of content, as well as the quality and breadth of content that is delivered across\nstreaming platforms. Accordingly, the future evolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact\nour success, is dependent many of the factors that are outside of our control.\nChanges in consumer viewing habits could harm our business.\nThe manner in which consumers access streaming content is changing rapidly. As the technological infrastructure for\ninternet access continues to improve and evolve, consumers will be presented with more opportunities to access\nvideo, music and games on-demand with interactive capabilities. Time spent on mobile devices is growing rapidly, in\nparticular by young adults streaming content as well as content from cable or satellite providers available live or\non-demand on mobile devices. In addition, personal computers, smart TVs, DVD players, Blu-ray players, gaming\nconsoles and cable set-top boxes allow users to access streaming content. If other streaming or technology\nproviders are able to respond and take advantage of changes in consumer viewing habits and technologies better than\nus, our business could be harmed.\n20\nNew entrants may enter the TV streaming market with unique service offerings or approaches to providing video. In\naddition, our competitors may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive\npositions. If new technologies render the TV streaming market obsolete or we are unable to successfully compete\nwith current and new competitors and technologies, our business will be harmed.\nWe and our Roku TV brand partners depend on our retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our players\nand Roku TV models, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we could\nexperience lower player or Roku TV model sales.\nTo continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand our retail sales channels. The majority of\nour players and our TV brand partners' Roku TV models are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such\nas Best Buy, Target and Walmart, including their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon. To a\nlesser extent, we sell players directly through our website and internationally through distributors. For the year\nended December 31, 2020, Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart in total accounted for 69% of our player segment revenue.\nThese three retailers collectively accounted for 72% and 68% of our player revenue for the years ended December 31,\n2019 and 2018, respectively. These retailers and our international distributors also sell products offered by our\ncompetitors. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or\ndistributors. If one or several retailers or distributors were to discontinue selling our players or our TV brand\npartners' Roku TV models, choose not to prominently display those devices in their stores or on their websites, or\nclose or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations because of shutdowns related to the COVID-19\npandemic, the volume of our streaming devices sold could decrease, which would harm our business. If any of our\nexisting TV brands choose to work exclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to,\nother operating system developers, this may impact our ability to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference\ndesign to TV brands and our ability to continue to grow active accounts. Traditional retailers have limited shelf\nand end cap space in their stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website\nproduct placement space. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product\nlines and stronger brand identity, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In\naddition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices and is able to market\nand promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or promote our devices on its\nwebsite. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our devices, or increased competition for available\nshelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain our product\nvisibility or result in reduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In particular, the\navailability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is critical to our\nrevenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our devices during these periods, our business would be\nharmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be\npositively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our\nplayers or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of Roku\nTV models and the quality of the content that our content publishers provide, may be out of our control, yet users\nmay nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness\nand market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and promote\ntheir brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and TV commercials, and have substantial\nresources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also have greater resources to utilize digital advertising\nor website product placement more effectively than we can. If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand,\nit may be difficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace,\ntherefore our ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from thousands of channels, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and watch,\nand they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to our streaming devices. While we have\npolicies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities or violates third-\nparty rights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content. Controversies\nrelated to the content included on certain of the channels that we distribute could result in negative publicity,\ncause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\n21\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers. This credit risk may\nvary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In addition, typically, we are\ncontractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated period of time, regardless\nof whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In addition, we typically experience\nslow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While we attempt to balance\npayment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not always successful. As a\nresult, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than our accounts receivables,\nrequiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through on our streaming platform\nor through our DSP. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In\nthe future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies and our bad debt exposure may increase over time.\nAny increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on time or at all,\nour business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important to our users and licensees, and, if we fail to provide adequate\nlevels of customer support, we could lose users and licensees, which would harm our business.\nOur users and licensees depend on our customer support organization to resolve any issues relating to our devices.\nA high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our devices. We currently outsource\nour customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization. If we do not effectively train,\nupdate and manage our third-party customer support organization to assist our users, and if that support\norganization does not succeed in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could\nadversely affect our ability to sell our devices to users and harm our reputation with potential new users and our\nlicensees.\nWe must successfully manage streaming device and other product introductions and transitions to remain competitive.\nWe must continually develop new and improved streaming devices and other products that meet changing consumer\ndemands. Moreover, the introduction of a new streaming device or other product is a complex task, involving\nsignificant expenditures in research and development, promotion and sales channel development. For example, in\n2018, we introduced our Roku TV Wireless Speakers, designed specifically for use with Roku TV models, in 2019 we\nintroduced our Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Wireless Subwoofer, and in 2020 we launched our Roku Streambar. Whether\nusers will broadly adopt new streaming devices or other products is not certain. Our future success will depend on\nour ability to develop new and competitively priced streaming devices and other products and add new desirable\ncontent and features to our streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new streaming devices and other\nproducts in a timely and cost-effective manner, and we must secure production orders for those products from our\ncontract manufacturers. The development of new streaming devices and other products is a highly complex process,\nand while our research and development efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems, we do not expect\nthat all of our projects will be successful. The successful development and introduction of new streaming devices\nand products depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\n22\ntariffs and trade and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments which could impact the pricing\nand availability of such devices and depress consumer demand; limit the ability of our contract\nmanufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies; lead to shortages; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not have manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract manufacturers, and\nour operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart soundbars, wireless subwoofers and our wireless speakers. Our contract manufacturers are\nvulnerable to:\ncapacity constraints,\nreduced component availability,\nproduction disruptions or delays, including from strikes, mechanical issues, quality control issues, natural\ndisasters, and public health crises, such as the pandemic caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, known\nas COVID-19; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs or trade restrictions on components, finished goods, software, or\nother products;\nincreases in U.S. tariffs on imports of our players; and\nforeign tariffs on U.S. parts or components for finished players or other Roku products that are assembled\nin Asia.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new streaming devices or other products. For example, during\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2020, one of our contract manufacturers experienced extended factory closures related\nto the spread of COVID-19 resulting in supply chain disruptions for our players and elevated air freight costs to\nmeet demand.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our players and other products to our quality and performance standards and specifications.\nDelays, component shortages and other manufacturing and supply problems could impair the retail distribution of our\nplayers and other products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our contract manufacturer’s\nfinancial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our players or other products to our retailers\nand distributors.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally do not obligate them to supply our players or other\nproducts in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In the event our contract manufacturers are unable to\nfulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, their costs increase because of U.S. or international\ntariffs or export or import restrictions, or they decide to terminate their relationship with us, our order\nfulfillment may be delayed, and we would have to identify, select and qualify acceptable alternative contract\nmanufacturers. Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a\nposition to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance\nstandards or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason\ncould require us to reduce our supply of players or other products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn\nwould reduce our revenue, or to incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our\nplayer gross margin. In addition, our contract manufacturer’s facilities are located in Southeast Asia, the\nPeople’s Republic of China and Brazil and may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, social and legal\nuncertainties that may harm or disrupt our relationships with these parties. We believe that the international\nlocation of these facilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade\nrestrictions on exports or imports. Furthermore, any manufacturing issues affecting the quality of our products,\nincluding players and audio products, could harm our business.\nIf our contract manufacturers fail for any reason to continue manufacturing our players or other products in\nrequired volumes and at high quality levels, or at all, we would have to identify, select and qualify acceptable\nalternative contract manufacturers. Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed, or\nat all, or may not be\n23\nin a position to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and\nperformance standards, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at a contract manufacturer could\nrequire us to reduce our supply of players or other products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would\nreduce our revenue, active account growth or streaming hour growth.\nCertain Roku TV brands do not have manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon contract manufacturers, and\nthe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if they encounter problems with their contract\nmanufacturers or suppliers.\nCertain Roku TV brands do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and primarily rely upon contract\nmanufacturers to build the Roku TV models that they sell to retailers. Their contract manufacturers may be\nvulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability, increases in U.S. tariffs on imports of Roku\nTV models, future possible changes in U.S. regulations on exports of U.S. technologies or dealings with certain\ncountries or parties, foreign tariffs on U.S. parts or components for Roku TV models that are assembled outside of\nthe U.S., and their control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs, particularly when components\nare in short supply may be limited. Delays, component shortages, factory shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the retail distribution of their Roku TV models. A significant\ninterruption in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors could, in turn, reduce our active\naccounts and streaming hours.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing issues affecting the quality of our Roku TV brand partners’ Roku TV models, could\nharm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements and manage our inventory with our contract\nmanufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays and lose revenue.\nWe bear supply risk under our contract manufacturing arrangements. Lead times for the materials and components that\nour contract manufacturers order on our behalf through different component suppliers vary significantly and depend\non numerous factors, including the specific supplier, contract terms and market demand for a component at a given\ntime. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our players or other products are\ncurrently lengthy, requiring our contract manufacturers to order materials and components several months in\nadvance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components\nand build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components that are\nunique to our products or build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or\nproducts. In the past, we have agreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were\nnot used as a result of our decision to discontinue a certain model of player or the use of particular components.\nIf we incur costs to cover excess supply commitments, this would harm our business.\nConversely, if we underestimate our player or other product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have\ninadequate component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our players or other products and result\nin delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In addition, from time to time we have\nexperienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship players via air freight, which is\nmore expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our player gross margin during such periods of high\ndemand, for example, during end-of-year holidays. If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements,\nour business may be harmed.\nOur players incorporate key components from sole source suppliers and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nsource these components on a timely basis, due to fabrication capacity issues or other material supply constraints,\nwe will not be able to deliver our players to our retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our players. Our players utilize specific system on chip,\nor SoC, Wi-Fi silicon products and Wi-Fi front-end modules from various manufacturers, depending on the player, for\nwhich we do not have a second source. Although this approach allows us to maximize player performance on lower cost\nhardware, reduce engineering qualification costs and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers,\nthis also creates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity\nissues or material supply issues, such as tariffs or other export or import restrictions on U.S. parts or\ncomponents for finished players that are used in final assembly of their components or on the finished players\nthemselves. There is also the risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations\nor be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, our competitors or other companies, or become subject\nto U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control restrictions or penalties.\n24\nSuch suppliers may also face production, shipping, or logistical constraints arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny such interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not be\navailable. Switching from a sole-source supplier would require that we redesign our players to accommodate new\ncomponents and would require us to re-qualify our players with regulatory bodies, such as the Federal\nCommunications Commission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our players could adversely affect our ability to meet\nscheduled player deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses and harm\nour business.\nOur players and Roku TV models must operate with various offerings, technologies and systems from our content\npublishers that we do not control. If our streaming devices do not operate effectively with those offerings,\ntechnologies and systems, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed for performance using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth\nwith our players and Roku TV models offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be\ninteroperable with all channels and other offerings, technologies and systems from our content publishers,\nincluding virtual multi-channel video programming distributors. We have no control over these offerings,\ntechnologies and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if our players and Roku TV models do\nnot provide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are\nmade to those offerings that are not compatible with our players or Roku TV models, we may be unable to increase\nactive account growth and user engagement, we may be required to increase our hardware costs and our business will\nbe harmed. We plan to continue to introduce new products regularly and we have experienced that it takes time to\noptimize such products to function well with these offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our\nlargest content publishers have the right to test and certify our new products before we can publish their channels\non these devices. The certification processes can be time consuming and introduce third-party dependencies into our\nproduct release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new products on a timely basis or require us to make\nchanges in order to obtain certifications, our product release plans may be adversely impacted, or we may not\ncontinue to offer certain channels. To continue to grow our active accounts and user engagement, we will need to\nprioritize development of our streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies and systems. If we\nare unable to maintain consistent operability of our devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms,\nour business could be harmed. In addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies and systems from our\ncontent publishers, such as virtual service operators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and\nother performance aspects of our streaming devices. We may not successfully develop streaming devices that operate\neffectively with these offerings, technologies or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and\nuse these offerings, technologies or systems, our business could be harmed.\nOur streaming devices are technically complex and may contain undetected hardware errors or software bugs, which\ncould manifest themselves in ways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur streaming devices and those of our licensees are technically complex and have contained and may in the future\ncontain undetected software bugs or hardware errors. These bugs and errors can manifest themselves in any number of\nways in our devices or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities,\ndata quality in logs or interpretation of data, malfunctions or even permanently disabled devices. Some errors in\nour devices may only be discovered after a device has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be\ndetected under certain circumstances or after extended use. We also update the Roku OS and our software on a\nregular basis, and, despite our quality assurance processes, we could introduce bugs in the process of any such\nupdate. The introduction of a serious software bug could result in devices becoming permanently disabled. We offer\na limited one-year warranty in the United States and any such defects discovered in our devices after commercial\nrelease could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users and\nincreased service costs, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We could\nalso face claims for product or information liability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or\nregulations. In addition, our contracts with users contain provisions\n25\nrelating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit,\nregardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s\nperception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is\nunavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design or other defects over which we have\nno control and render our devices permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors in our products that\ncould harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design or other defect, they can cause our\nproducts to fail and render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by which our users connect\ntheir home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network router. If the Wi-Fi\nreceiver in our player fails, then our player cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access point, and our player\nwill not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to replace these\nplayers at our sole cost and expense. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the\nmarket could be adversely affected and our replacement of these players would harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to develop new\nstreaming players or platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize commercially available off-the-shelf technology in the development of our players and streaming\nplatform. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to our players and our streaming platform, we\nmay be required to license additional technologies from third parties. These third-party licenses may be\nunavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain necessary third-party\nlicenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies with lower quality or performance standards, or at a\ngreater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of our players, streaming platform and our business.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve\nor maintain profitability.\nWe began operations in 2002 and we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations in each year\nsince inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $332.4 million and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 we experienced a net loss of $17.5 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the\nfuture as we continue to expand our operations. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than\nour operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. We expect to incur significant\nlosses in the future for a number of reasons, including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties\ndescribed herein. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications, delays and other factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our expenses exceed our\nrevenue, we may never achieve or maintain profitability and our business may be harmed.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\nyear and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new\ncompanies;\nour ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users,\nand monetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices, in response to the competitive markets in which we\noperate or other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation or increased taxes;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;\n26\nseasonal, cyclical or other shifts in revenue from advertising or player sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels or features;\nthe addition or loss of popular content or channels;\nthe expense and availability of content to license for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our players or the manufacturing or component costs\nof our TV brand licensees for Roku TV models;\ndelays in delivery of our players or our partners’ Roku TV models, or disruptions in our or our licensees’\nsupply or distribution chains, including any disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs, or other\ntrade restrictions or disruptions; and\nan increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party\nintellectual property infringement allegations or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our player segment revenue has a lower gross\nmargin compared to our platform segment revenue derived through our arrangements with advertising, content\ndistribution, billing, and licensing activities. Gross margins on our players vary across player models and can\nchange over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, player\nreturns and other cost fluctuations. In addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as\noverall profitability, may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic or sales channel mix,\ncomponent cost increases, price competition, or the introduction of new streaming devices, including those that\nhave higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically\nreduce our player gross margin in an effort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our gross profit. As\na result, our player segment revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless we\nare able to continue to increase our platform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be unable to\ngrow gross profit and our business will be harmed. If a reduction in gross margin does not result in an increase in\nour active accounts or increase our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may suffer, and our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant\ndemands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our players;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nsupport a larger number of TV brand and service operators;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our business\nwill be harmed.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing and supporting our devices and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our devices and\nstreaming platform.\n27\nIn the course of expanding our international operations and operating overseas, in addition to the risks we face in\nthe United States, we will be subject to a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\ndiffering regulatory requirements, including country-specific data privacy and security laws and\nregulations, consumer protection laws and regulations, tax laws, trade laws, labor regulations, tariffs,\nexport quotas, custom duties on cross-border movements of goods or data flows, extension of limits on TV\nadvertising minutes to OTT advertising, local content requirements, data or data processing localization\nrequirements, or other trade restrictions;\ncompliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption\nlaws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to\ngovernment officials;\ncompliance with various privacy, data transfer, data protection, accessibility, consumer protection and\nchild protection laws in the European Union (“EU”) and other international markets that we operate in;\nslower adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ncompetition with other devices that consumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional pay TV\nservices and products, including those provided by incumbent pay TV service providers;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing our streaming devices and streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain\ninternational markets;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, the presence of local consumer\nelectronics companies and the greater availability of free content on over-the-air channels in certain\ncountries;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges inherent in efficiently staffing and managing an increased number of employees over large\ngeographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, compensation and\nbenefits, and compliance programs;\ndifficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign\njurisdictions;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions whatever the cause, including pandemics, impacts from the United\nKingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), tariffs, trade wars, local or global\nrecessions, or long-term environmental risks;\ninternational political or social unrest or economic instability, including U.S.-China tensions, and other\npolitical, security, or economic tensions between countries in which we do business or which serve as\nsources for Roku products;\nadverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations\ncould impact our judgment in determining our tax provision and effective tax rate;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, which are currently\nprohibited under the WTO’s e-commerce moratorium, but could be permitted if certain WTO Members continue to\noppose extension of the moratorium when it is considered at the WTO’s MC-12 Ministerial Meeting, which was\npostponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is scheduled to take place in 2021;\ndigital services taxes, which have been imposed or are under consideration by several European and other\ncountries, which would lead to taxes on certain digital services even though the providers would not be\nsubject to tax under existing international tax rules and treaties;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemics or epidemics could result in decreased economic activity in\ncertain markets, decreased use of our products or platform, or in our decreased ability to import, export,\nship, or sell our products to supply such services to existing or new customers in international markets;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions;\nfuture possible changes in U.S. regulations on exports of U.S. technologies or dealings with certain\ncountries or parties, including expanding export control restrictions on China and Hong Kong; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\n28\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit\nare traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total\nnet revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, a significant percentage of our player sales through retailers in the fourth quarter are pursuant to\ncommitted sales agreements with retailers for which we recognize significant discounts in the average selling\nprices in the third quarter in an effort to grow our active accounts, which will reduce our player gross margin.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our device sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, disruptions in our supply or distribution chain, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, or for any\nother reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, delays or\ndisruptions at U.S. ports of entry could adversely affect our or our distributors’ ability to timely deliver\nplayers and co-branded Roku TV models to retailers during the holiday season. A substantial portion of our expenses\nare personnel related, including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and facilities related none of\nwhich are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue shortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the\nnegative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in the short term, and our business would be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our devices and streaming platform, our culture and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Our employees,\nparticularly engineers and other product developers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to\nidentifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. Because we face significant\ncompetition for personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located, to attract\ntop talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation packages\nbefore we can validate the productivity of those employees. To retain employees, we also may need to increase our\nemployee compensation levels in response to competition. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional\nskilled employees is necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and\nthe integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\nmany of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, the equity ownership of many of our\nemployees could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners and\nother licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business are increasingly\ncomplex. To manage the expected growth of our\n29\noperations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and financial systems, procedures and controls\nand continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations. An inability to do so will\nnegatively affect our financial reporting, billing and payment services. Our current and planned systems,\nprocedures and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and\nexpense recognition for our future operations and expected growth. Delays or problems associated with any\nimprovement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our\nrelationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement agencies, Roku TV brand partners, or\nother licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and could also result in errors in our financial and other\nreporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity\nsecurities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable\naccounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property\nclaims, and may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the\nacquisitions. In addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products or technologies may create\nunforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies in\ninternational markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across\ndifferent cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks\nassociated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without\nincurring significant costs, delays or other operational problems and if we were unable to address such risks\nsuccessfully our business could be harmed.\nWe have outstanding debt and our credit facility provides our lender with a first-priority lien against\nsubstantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may\nlimit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe entered into a credit agreement among us, as borrower, the lenders and issuing banks from time to time party\nthereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., or the Agent providing for a (i) a four-year revolving credit\nfacility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-\nyear delayed draw term loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, (the “Term Loan A\nFacility”) and (iii) an uncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (collectively, the “Credit\nAgreement”). The Credit Agreement contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants, which may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry\nor take future actions. The Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum\nadjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on the basis of the\nprior period of our four consecutive fiscal quarters. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we granted the Agent a\nsecurity interest in substantially all of our assets. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Term Loan A and\nRevolving Credit Facilities.”\nIn November 2019, we borrowed $100.0 million aggregate principal amount pursuant to the Term Loan A Facility and in\nMarch 2020, we borrowed $69.3 million aggregate principal amount of revolving loans pursuant to the Revolving\nCredit Facility. In May 2020, weentered into the Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which we sold 4.0\nmillion shares of our Class A common stock at an average selling price of $126.01 per share, for aggregate gross\nproceeds of $504.0 million, a portion of which was used to repay the$69.3 million outstanding under our Revolving\nCredit Facility. We also have outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2020 totaling $30.8 million against\nthe Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.\nHowever, if we fail to comply with the covenants, make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo\nany other event of default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which\nwould give it the right to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings\noutstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition,\nthe Agent would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit\nAgreement. If the outstanding debt under the\n30\nCredit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient assets to repay it,\nwhich would harm our business and financial condition.\nWhen we borrowed pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, we chose a variable interest rate based on London\nInter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the\nsubject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for phase out. The future of LIBOR\nat this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity\nrelated to LIBOR’s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.The\nconsequences of the developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the value of our\nLIBOR-linked financial obligations, such as an increase in the cost of our credit agreement indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new devices and enhance our streaming\nplatform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our retail partners’ demand requirements, improve our\noperating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Our primary uses of cash\ninclude operating costs such as personnel-related expenses and capital spending. Our future capital requirements\nmay vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors including our growth rate and the\ncontinuing market acceptance of our streaming platform, the Roku OS and players along with the timing and effort\nrelated to the introduction of new platform features, players, hiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of\nsales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic conditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of\nholders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses and an\nacceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain\nadequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be\nharmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the\nordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate,\npersonal and other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment\ncard information, other user information and other confidential information. It is critical that we do so in a\nsecure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. Our obligations\nunder applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-certifications, and other documentation may\ninclude maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information in our possession or\ncontrol, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as part of an information security program, and\nlimits on the use and/or cross-border transfer of such personal information. These obligations create potential\nlegal liability, to regulators, our business partners, our users, and other relevant stakeholders and also impact\nthe attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential users.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits\n31\nand stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information) and as a result, we manage\na number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our information technology systems (including our\ncomputer networks) or to our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract\nor outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems,\nincluding the functions of third parties that are involved or have access to those systems, is very large and\ncomplex. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nsecurity breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility and distributed nature of\nour information technology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those\nsystems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external threats on\nour technology environment. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our\nemployees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are\nincreasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by\nsophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to,\nindustrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others.\nFor example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including any efforts to educate or train our employees, we remain vulnerable to phishing attacks.\nAlthough we have, and may in the future, implement remote working protocols and offer work-issued devices to\nemployees, the actions of our employees while working remotely may have a greater effect on the security of our\nsystems and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems or data arising from\nemployees’ combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that\nwe do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nThese risks have been heightened by the dramatic increase in the numbers of our employees who have been and are\ncontinuing to work from home as a result of government guidelines and internal policies that have been put in place\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information, other threats\ncould include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering\nand other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\ninformation. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the nature of our third-party web hosting, cloud\ncomputing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our systems likely experience directed attacks on\nat least a periodic basis that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’, content publishers’\nand advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; and/or obtain our data (including without\nlimitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information). Although we have implemented certain\nsystems, processes, and safeguards intended to protect our information technology systems and data from such\nthreats and mitigate risks to our systems and data, we cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a\nmaterial impact on our systems or services in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain\nthreats may not be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and data due to the developing\nsophistication and means of attack in the threat landscape. Recent developments in the threat landscape include an\nincreased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks, with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the\nsophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology. Additionally, our third-party vendors or\nbusiness partners’ information technology systems may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be\naffected by those or similar third-party relationships.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that our insurance policies may not cover some or all\naspects of a security incident. Even where an incident is covered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not\ncover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we may be faced with in the wake of a security incident.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Our platform also incorporates licensed software from third parties, including\nopen-source software, and we may also be vulnerable to attacks that focus on such third-party software. Any\nattempts by threat actors to\n32\ndisrupt our platform, our streaming devices, website, computer systems or our mobile apps, if successful, could\nharm our business, subject us to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations and\ndamage our reputation. Efforts to prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting\nvulnerabilities in our devices are expensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing\nintrusion or vulnerabilities. Such unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and\ncould expose us to the risk of contractual damages, litigation and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm\nour business. The risk of harm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our\nproduct and service offerings and as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security\nsafeguards requires substantial resources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ and/or commercial partners’ information technology systems or\nother similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and\ntelecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our product development and our\nbusiness operations.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to\nsystems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that\nleads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal\ninformation regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming,\ndistracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require\nus to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and\ncontractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could\nresult in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\nFor example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties\nand related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment\nCard Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.\nPenalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities\nwithin the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy,\nconfidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further security\nincidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of\nsensitive information, which could include personal information, may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system or networks as less desirable or we could be subject to claims by\nthird parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and\nadversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents. Data protection laws around the world often require\n“reasonable”, “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation\nand application of those laws are often uncertain and evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security\nmeasures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security\nmeasures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not\nbe able to protect the information we maintain. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory\ncorrective action due to a data security incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result\nin substantial costs for years to come.\n33\nWe and our service providers collect, process, transmit and store the personal information of our users, which\ncreates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit and store information about a variety of individuals including our users and their\ndevices, and rely on third party service providers to collect, process, transmit and store personal information of\nour users, including our users’ payment card data. Further, we and our service providers as well as business\npartners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers and related technologies, to help us\nmanage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website and partners’ content to deliver\nrelevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our partners on our devices.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully\nleverage this data as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be\nrestricted by a number of factors, including users’ having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our,\nour service providers or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by\nadvertisers, content publishers and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws, regulations\nand industry standards. For example, certain EU laws and regulations prohibit access to or storage of information\non a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for advertising) that is not “strictly\nnecessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of a transmission unless the user has\nprovided unambiguous, affirmative consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection of\ninformation which is used for advertising purposes. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could\nharm our ability to grow our revenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant\nrecipients of advertising campaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing and security of the data we\nreceive from and about our users, employees and other individuals. The regulatory environment for the collection\nand use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers, content distributors,\nadvertisers and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally. Privacy groups and government\nbodies, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state attorneys general, the European Commission and\nEuropean data protection authorities, have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that\nidentify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the\ninternet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The United States, U.S. states, and foreign\ngovernments have enacted and are considering laws and regulations that could significantly restrict industry\nparticipants’ ability to collect, use and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of consumer\nnotice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For example, the EU\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective in May 2018 and imposes detailed requirements related\nto the collection, storage and use of personal information related to people located in the EU or which is\nprocessed in the context of EU operations and places new data protection obligations and restrictions on\norganizations and may require us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what\nwe have already done.\nFurther, in the wake of Brexit, there has been uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the\nUnited Kingdom. Although the United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018, and the EU may declare the\nUnited Kingdom’s privacy laws as adequate for receiving personal information from the EU, a level of uncertainty\nremains regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated after Brexit. We made changes\nto our data protection compliance program to prepare for the GDPR and will continue to monitor the implementation\nand evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not compliant with GDPR or other data protection laws\nor regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties (such as restrictions\non personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For example, under the GDPR, fines of up to EUR\n20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, whichever is greater, as well as data\nprocessing restrictions could be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Other countries have\nalso proposed or passed legislation with obligations similar to that of the GDPR.\nThe U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with states such as California and Nevada having\nenacted broad-based data privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing\nto consider additional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-\nreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and\nexpenses in an effort to comply. Effective October 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal\nInformation Law (“SPI Law”) to\n34\nnow require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to intake requests\nfrom consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect\nin January 2020 and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information such as\nrights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of the sale of their personal\ninformation, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides\nfor civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data\nbreach litigation. The CCPA was amended and the California Office of the Attorney General published final\nregulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was\npassed into law and goes into effect on January 1, 2023 (with a ‘look-back’ to January 1, 2022). The CPRA builds on\nthe CCPA and amongst other things,requires the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy\nissues.\nData protection laws continue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For\nexample, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) came into effect on August 15, 2020. The LGPD bears many\nsubstantive similarities to the GDPR such as extra-territorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data\ntransfer restrictions and mandatory breach notification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a\ncompany’s Brazilian revenue.\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments\nto existing laws on our business.\nApplicable data privacy and security laws may also obligate us to employ security measures that are appropriate to\nthe nature of the data we collect and process and, among other factors, the risks attendant to our data processing\nactivities in order to protect personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental or\nunlawful destruction, loss, or alteration. We have implemented security measures that we believe are appropriate,\nbut a regulator could deem our security measures not to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in\ncertain data protection laws. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be\nsure that our chosen safeguards will protect against security threats to our business including the personal\ninformation that we process. However, even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance\nwith applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our information technology systems and the data\ncontained in those systems, or our data that is contained in third parties’ systems. Moreover, certain data\nprotection laws impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our\ndata processing. Our employees’ or third parties’ intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase\nour vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for\nsuccessful access, acquisition or other disclosure of our data despite the quality and legal sufficiency of our\nsecurity measures.\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to the United States. However, there\nare certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of these data transfer mechanisms, the resolution of\nwhich may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to the United States. On July\n16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the highest EU Court) ruled the EU-US Privacy Shield to be an invalid data\ntransfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding\nsupplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. We are currently awaiting regulatory\nguidance from EU Data Protection Authorities and the US Department of Commerce on the impact of this ruling on\nbroader international data transfer compliance for companies, including guidance on specific supplementary measures\nthat all companies would be required to implement in addition to the Model Clauses. This may involve changes that\nrequire significant time and resources to implement, including through adjusting our operations, conducting\nrequisite data transfer assessments, and revising our contracts. Our ability to continue to transfer personal\ninformation outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to increased scrutiny and\nliability under the GDPR, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers\nin the future. In addition, cloud service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened\nscrutiny from EU regulators, which may lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer\npersonal information outside the EU, which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some\n35\nflexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for\ncertain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted ‘data localization’ laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their country be maintained in their country. Maintaining local data centers in individual\ncountries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect that, in addition to the business as usual\ncosts of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and enforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, as\nwell as other domestic and foreign data protection laws will lead to increased operational and compliance costs and\nwill require us to continually monitor and, where necessary, make changes to our operations, policies, and\nprocedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of\nsecurity of user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, contractual indemnity or public\nstatements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others. In addition to potential liability, these events could\nharm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information and/or other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving\ncompliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and\ndocumentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state and federal action if they are\nfound to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws,\nenactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our\ncost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal information and confidential information that we (or\nour service providers or business partners) collect, store or process could trigger contractual and legal\nobligations, harm our reputation, subject us to liability and otherwise adversely affect our business including our\nfinancial results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and process personal information (including payment card\ninformation) and/or other confidential information of our employees, our partners, and our users. We use third-\nparty service providers and subprocessors to help us deliver our services. These vendors may store or process\npersonal information, payment card information and/or other confidential information of our employees, our\npartners, or our users. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad\nand may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected.\nA variety of state, national, and foreign laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection,\ndisclosure, security, transfer, cross-border transfer, localization, and other processing of personal information.\nThese privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, with new or modified laws and\nregulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different\ninterpretations. In addition, each state and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nEU member states, and the United Kingdom, as well as some other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring\nnotification to regulatory authorities, to affected users, and/or others within a specific timeframe when there has\nbeen a security breach involving certain personal information as well as impose additional obligations for\ncompanies. Additionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event\nof a security breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may\ncause our users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\nLitigation resulting from security breaches may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our platform,\nsystems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our users or other relevant stakeholders.\nThese proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management’s time and attention,\nincrease our costs of doing business, and/or adversely affect our reputation. We could be required to\n36\nfundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products and/or platform capabilities in\nresponse to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Any actual or perceived inability\nto adequately protect the privacy of individuals’ information in our possession, custody or control may render our\nproducts or services less desirable and could harm our reputation and business. Any costs incurred as a result of\nthis potential liability could harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the performance and operation of the\nRoku OS, streaming platform and computer systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our devices\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users. We utilize computer systems located either in our\nfacilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-based or cloud computing\nservices. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we exercise no control over\ntheir operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions or delays that they may experience. In the\nfuture, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting systems to cloud computing\nservices, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we are unable to manage such a\ntransition effectively, we may experience operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nUpon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace\ntheir services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable\nto us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies\nuntil the transition is complete. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications\nfailures, break-ins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely. As\nwe do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations and could adversely affect our business. Any disruption in the services provided by these vendors could\nhave adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. We expect to continue\nto invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform performance. To\nthe extent that we or our third-party service hosting provider do not effectively address capacity constraints,\nupgrade or patch systems as needed and continually develop technology and network architecture to accommodate\nincreasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated changes in\ntechnology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain low-cost, high-speed\naccess to the internet, which relies in part on the network operators’ continuing willingness to upgrade and\nmaintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their continued\nwillingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over network\noperators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions or delays in their operations. Any material\ndisruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business if network operators\nengage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in an effort to monetize access to their\nnetworks by data providers. In the past, internet service providers have attempted to implement usage-based\npricing, bandwidth caps and traffic “shaping” or throttling. To the extent network operators were to create tiers\nof internet access service and either charge us for access to these tiers or prohibit our content offerings from\nbeing available on some or all of these tiers, our quality of service could decline, our operating expenses could\nincrease and our ability to attract and retain users could be impaired, each of which would harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers\nwith multichannel video programming. These network operators have an incentive to use their network\n37\ninfrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of other companies seeking to distribute\nsimilar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their\nown data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our devices and\nstreaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent\nlitigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been or could be substantial. Some of our\ncompetitors may be better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their\nsubstantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant\nmanagement time and divert management from our business. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and\ncontinuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The\noccurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or\nroyalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to\ngain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property\nlicenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the\nscope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us\nand our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual\nproperty; cease making, licensing or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent or materials; and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. In addition, any lawsuits regarding\nintellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time\nand attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business and operating\nresults could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and other\nintellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek to\nprotect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and any third parties\nwho have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology. However, we cannot be certain that we have\nexecuted such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who had\naccess to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements will not be breached. Any party\nwith whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary\ninformation, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We\ncannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or\nthat competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially\nequivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing\na claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-consuming and could\nresult in substantial costs and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the\n38\nenforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant\nproblems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may\nalso be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and\nother intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets or other sensitive\ninformation. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to\nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable\nto prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of\nour trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could\nharm our business.\nWe have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is\nno guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained\nwill be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Patent laws, and\nscope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change to\n“first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the\ndetermination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to\nprotect the innovations contained within our devices and platform and could harm our business.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and to pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with\nthese requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or\ncomplete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity or diversion of management and\ntechnical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our devices and our\nstreaming platform.\nWe incorporate open source software in our streaming platform. From time to time, companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source\nsoftware and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been\ninterpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on the sale of our devices. In such event, we could be required to make\nour proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses\nfrom third parties in order to continue offering our devices, to re-engineer our devices or to discontinue the sale\nof our devices in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could\nharm our business.\n39\nUnder our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract manufacturer\nand suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to infringe upon\nthe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were\nto lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary\nliabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and Roku TV brands often involve the\nuse of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of\ninfringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to our\ntechnology.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business and we are unable to predict the extent to which the\npandemic and related effects will continue to impact our business.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing into 2021, there has been widespread global impact from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and our business has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the pandemic and resulting\neconomic consequences. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to take precautionary measures intended to help\nminimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including mandatory work-from-home policies, suspending non-\nessential business travel and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We may take\nfurther actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our\nemployees, TV brand partners, content publishers, advertisers, retail and distribution partners, contract\nmanufacturers, services venders and supply chain. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to\nmitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and an extended period of remote work arrangements could disrupt\nour business, introduce business and operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and could make it more\ndifficult for us to effectively manage our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measures that we have taken in response have had a mixed impact on our\nbusiness during the year ended December 31, 2020. When staying-at-home restrictions were first issued in the first\nquarter of 2020, we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours, which has moderated since peaking in early in the\nsecond quarter, and account activations. In our platform segment, we experienced increases in trials of and\nsubscriptions to SVOD content, growth in the consumption of AVOD content, and increased purchases of TVOD content.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we experienced delays in the start of some video advertising campaigns and an\nincrease in advertising campaign cancellations. We also have encountered supply chain disruptions related to our\nplayers that resulted in elevated air freight costs to replenish inventory and meet increased demand. Additionally,\nat times some of our retail partners have had to close or severely limit access to their brick-and-mortar\nlocations, resulting in reduced sale of devices in these locations. For example, during the holiday season our\npartners saw fewer shoppers in their brick-and-mortar locations. Further, our management team has focused on\naddressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, which has required and will continue to require, a\nsignificant investment of their time and resources, and has diverted their attention away from other aspects of our\nbusiness. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 our management team took steps to slow the rate of growth\nof our operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our management team also monitored our liquidity and in May\n2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets\nInc., as sales agents (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”), pursuant to which we sold 4.0 million shares of our\nClass A common stock at an average selling price of $126.01 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $504.0\nmillion, a portion of which was used to repay $69.3 million that we drew down on our Revolving Credit Facility in\nMarch 2020. Our management team will continue to evaluate our investments and initiatives for 2021 and will\ncontinue to monitor our liquidity as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business will depend on future developments, which\nare uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its\nseverity, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the virus or treat its impacts, the development\nand rollout of effective vaccines, possible variants of the virus that render vaccines ineffective, and how quickly\nand to what extent economic and operating conditions normalize. As staying-at-home restrictions are eased consumers\nmay spend less time streaming TV, which could reduce our streaming hours and number of active accounts and also\ncould negatively impact our platform revenue if we experience a decrease in sales of advertising or transactional\nrevenue shares from content\n40\npublishers. We also may incur significant operating costs and be exposed to increased liability risks as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, both now and increasingly as once staying-at-home restrictions are lifted and employees\nbegin to return to our offices, such as the cost of collecting additional information (including health and medical\ninformation) about our employees, contractors and visitors at our facilities; and testing supplies and personal\nprotective equipment for on-site staff. In addition, with the increase in remote working during the COVID-19\npandemic, we may not be able to maintain the same level of control over the security of our systems or the personal\ninformation that we collect, store and process, particularly as cyber attackers appear to increasingly attempt to\ncompromise systems and data in an effort to exploit this pandemic. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic itself has\nsubsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of any global economic impact,\nincluding as a result of an ongoing recession. For instance, a prolonged economic downturn may result in the\npurchase of fewer streaming devices which could lead to a reduction in account activations and streaming hours, and\nalso could negatively impact our revenue. Our platform business also may be negatively impacted by decreases in\ntotal advertising spend, if advertising budgets do not continue to shift to OTT advertising or if acquiring content\nthat our users want to watch becomes more difficult or costly for us or our content partners as the amount of new\ncontent decreases due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged economic downturn could also impact the overall\nfinancial condition of our TV brand partners, content publishers, advertisers, retailers, contract manufacturer,\nservices venders and supply chain all of whom we depend on in order to operate our business. As a result, the\ncurrent level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic means the impact on\nour business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt and impact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, medical epidemic or\npandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other man-made disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt our\nbusiness operations. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in\norder to fully resume operations. In particular, our principal offices are located in California, our contract\nmanufacturer and some of our suppliers are located in Asia both of which are regions known for seismic activity\nmaking our operations in these areas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas.\nOur insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. If our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or\nother event, our ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired.\nDisruptions in the operations of our contract manufacturer as a result of a disaster or other catastrophic event\ncould delay the manufacture and shipment of our players or other products, which could impact our business. If we\nare unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a\ndisaster or other catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or\ncatastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to the internet\nand online services, which may include laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children and accessibility, among\nothers. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation and\nregulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the laws and regulations governing issues such as data privacy\nand security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs and\nconsumer protection related to the internet continue to develop. For example, laws relating to the liability of\nproviders of online services for activities of their users and other third parties have been tested by a number of\nclaims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark\ninfringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the advertisements\nposted, actions taken or not taken by providers in response to user activity or the content provided by users.\nCongress has also enacted legislation related to liability of providers of online services and may continue to\nlegislate in this area. The CCPA and Nevada SPI Law also apply to entities that do business in California and\nNevada, respectively, and\n41\nimpose a number of requirements on internet and online services. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising\ncontinue to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices, and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing our Roku TV reference design, we were\nrequired to understand, address and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing, manufacturing,\nmarketing and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations regarding the\nmanufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and our licensees may be unable to sell Roku\nTV models at all, which would harm our business and our ability to grow our user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, and\nsimilar activities continue to proliferate, often with little harmonization between jurisdictions and limited\nguidance. A number of existing bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and other government bodies that contain\nprovisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and other tracking technologies to\ncollect, use and share user information. The CCPA also imposes requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nalready has existing laws, which are due for update in 2021, requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for\nexample, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from users for the placement of cookies or other tracking\ntechnologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. If we or the third parties that we work with, such as\ncontract payment processing services, content publishers, vendors or developers violate or are alleged to violate\napplicable privacy or security laws, industry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such\nviolations and alleged violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business\nand reputation and subject us to potential liability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers\nor publishers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply\nwith these laws may subject us to liability and reputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npublishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).\nSome of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to\nactivities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties. The Federal Trade\nCommission has also in recent years revised its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act\n(“COPPA Rules”) broadening the applicability of the COPPA Rules, including the types of information that are\nsubject to these regulations, and it is currently examining whether additional changes are appropriate. Such\nactions could limit the information that we or our content publishers and advertisers may collect and use through\ncertain content publishers, the content of advertisements and in relation to certain channel partner content. The\nCCPA also imposes certain opt in and opt out requirements for certain information about minors. We and our content\npublishers and advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other privacy,\nadvertising, or similar laws.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our\ncontrol may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which our contract manufacturer and component suppliers are located.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical\nconditions. For example, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to U.S.\ntrade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs. For example, in November 2018, the United States, Mexico, and\nCanada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) which supersedes the North American Free Trade\nAgreement. The USMCA has been ratified by the respective legislatures of each of the three countries. Congress\napproved the USMCA in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (H.R.5430) in January 2020 (the\n“Act”), and the President signed the Act into law. The USMCA agreement entered into force on July 1, 2020, although\nthere are some remaining issues with respect to ensuring that Mexico’s and Canada’s laws and regulations to ensure\nthat both are fully in compliance with the USMCA obligations and commitments, and there may be further changes to\ninterim regulations regarding customs procedures, rules of origin, and other provisions that could affect products\nsourced from Mexico or Canada, and their eligibility for duty-free entry into the U.S., Mexican, and Canadian\nmarkets.\nThe previous U.S. Administration threatened tougher trade terms with China, the European Union, and other\ncountries, including the imposition of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $320 billion of\nimports from China. In response, China imposed higher Chinese tariffs on a large amount of U.S. exports to China,\nwhich could affect\n42\nthe prices of U.S. origin parts or components of our products assembled in China. In January 2020, the U.S. and\nChina signed a “Phase One” trade deal pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. will modify its Section 301\ntariff actions. As part of the Phase One agreement, the U.S. canceled additional Section 301 duties that were\noriginally scheduled to go into effect in December 2019 on certain imported products, including certain of our\nproducts, and reduced the duties on certain other imported products, including televisions assembled in China by\nRoku TV brand partners, from 15%ad valoremto 7.5%. While the new U.S. Administration has promised a detailed review\nof U.S. policies toward China, it is unclear what the outcomes of the review will be or whether it could lead to\nadditional U.S. tariffs, export controls, or sanctions.\nAt this time, it is unknown whether the Phase One deal will last or whether there will be sufficient progress on\nPhases Two and Three to lead to a further reduction in U.S.-China trade tensions: whether additional Section 301\ntariffs will be imposed on Roku products, imported from China and, if so, how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods\nwill remain in effect or whether even higher tariffs will be imposed, or new regulatory proposals to restrict trade\nwill be adopted. There are also pressures on the new U.S. Administration to retaliate against China over China’s\nactions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang Province, which could lead to additional U.S., Chinese and other tariffs, or a\nresumption of trade hostilities, exposing us to increased tariffs in the U.S. and Chinese markets. Finally, there\nare questions whether international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing free trade agreements re-\nnegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the new Administration; or the effect that any\nsuch action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry or our business or licensees. If any new\nlegislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or terminated, or\nif tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be inefficient and expensive for us to alter our\nbusiness operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes, and higher prices could depress consumer\ndemand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations or cash flows.\nOn January 15, 2021, the U.S. Trade Representative found that Vietnam’s currency practices violate Section 301 of\nthe Trade Act of 1974 but deferred any decision whether to take any specific actions in connection with its\nfindings, leaving the decision whether to impose higher U.S. tariffs or other trade restrictions to the new U.S.\nAdministration. This decision could lead to increased tariffs on products assembled in Vietnam, but none have been\nannounced as of this time.\nIn addition, on October 2, 2020, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation\nunder Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 regarding Vietnam’s acts, policies, and practices related to the import\nand use of illegally harvested timber. While no decision has been reached yet in this investigation, as with China,\nUSTR's Section 301 investigations of Vietnam could lead to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports from Vietnam if the\nU.S. concerns cannot be resolved through negotiations. Such tariffs may not be limited to products directly\ninvolved in the acts, policies, and practices found to violate Section 301 (e.g. tropical timber) and thus could\naffect other, unrelated products, including those sourced by us or our suppliers and licensees.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain commodities,\nsoftware, and technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could\nlimit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or strategic\npartners, or could limit our commercial and/or strategic partners’ ability to implement our products in those\ncountries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the\nintroduction of our products in international markets, prevent our commercial and/or strategic partners with\ninternational operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of\nour products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. In particular, the U.S. government continues\nto expand export control restrictions on China and Hong Kong, which may limit the company’s ability to collaborate\nwith and transfer technology to partners in the region. Cross-border data transmissions are currently exempt from\ncustoms duties under the WTO’s temporary e-commerce moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, but\nthe moratorium faces opposition from certain WTO Members when it comes up for renewal at the WTO Ministerial\nMeeting, which was originally scheduled for June 2020. It has been postponed because of COVID-19 but may take place\nin 2021. Other potential barriers include the further proliferation of digital services taxes which potentially\ncould expose certain digital services to new taxes, U.S. or foreign sanctions or related sanctions legislation,\nincreased export and import restrictions stemming from governmental policies or U.S.-China “de-coupling,” or\nchanges in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, restrictions, and\nsanctions. Any change in export or import regulations, the imposition of customs duties or other restrictions on\nintangible goods such as cross-border data flows, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our\ndecreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or new customers in international markets or hamper\nour ability to source\n43\nproducts, components, and parts from certain suppliers. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our\nability to export, import, or sell our products, or source parts and/or components, would harm our business.\nFurther, following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom formally left the EU on January 31, 2020.\nThe effects of Brexit have been and are expected to continue to be far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to\nits impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute\nto instability in global financial markets. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of\ngoods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal\nuncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws\nto replace or replicate. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given these possibilities and others we may not\nanticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.\nThe supply chains of our contract manufacturers and many of our licensees may source products, parts or components\nfrom China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. There are many uncertainties around the COVID-19\npandemic, including scientific and health issues, the unknown duration and extent of economic disruption in China\nand other markets in the region, and the impact on the Chinese, U.S., and global economies. As a result, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may result in further supply shortages of our products or our licensees’ products, and delays in\nshipping and transportation services that negatively impact our ability or our licensees’ ability to import,\nexport, ship, or sell streaming devices to customers in U.S. and international markets. Any decrease, limitations\nor delays on our or our licensees’ ability to produce, import, export, ship, or sell our streaming devices would\nharm our business.\nUnited States or international rules that permit ISPs to limit internet data consumption by users, including\nunreasonable discrimination in the provision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nLaws, regulations or court rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including\ndecisions that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, could decrease customer demand for our\nservice offerings, may impose additional burdens on us or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our\nbusiness model.\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted open internet rules intended to protect the ability of consumers and content\nproducers to send and receive non-harmful, lawful information on the internet, known as the Open Internet Order.\nThe Open Internet Order prohibited broadband internet access service providers from: (i) blocking access to legal\ncontent, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (ii) throttling, impairing or degrading performance based\non content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (iii) charging more for favorable delivery of\ncontent or favoring self-provisioned content over third-party content (collectively, the “prohibited activities”).\nThe Open Internet Order also prohibited broadband internet access service providers from unreasonably interfering\nwith consumers’ ability to select, access and use the lawful content, applications, services or devices of their\nchoosing as well as edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to\nconsumers.\nIn January 2018, the FCC released a new order, known as the Restoring Internet Freedom Order (the “Order”), that\nrepealed most of the blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization restrictions adopted in the Open Internet Order.\nThe Order reclassified broadband internet access service as a non-common carrier “information service” and repealed\nrules that had prohibited broadband internet access service providers from conducting the “prohibited activities”\nbut continued to require broadband internet access service providers to be transparent about their policies and\nnetwork management practices, and subjected discriminatory practices to case-by-case assessment under antitrust and\nconsumer protection laws. Most portions of the Order went into effect in April 2018 and the remainder went into\neffect in June 2018. Numerous judicial challenges to the Order were filed, and in October 2019, the Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld nearly all of the Order, but reversed the FCC's decision to\nprohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet access service, requiring case by case\ndeterminations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC's rules. The court also required the\nFCC to reexamine three issues from the Order where it found insufficient analysis but allowed the Order to remain\nin effect pending the FCC’s review. The original parties were denied a rehearing by the full U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the D.C. Circuit in February 2020 and the period to seek review by the Supreme Court has ended. On remand, the\nFCC reaffirmed its existing approach in October 2020; however, four petitioners sought reconsideration of the FCC’s\ndecision in February 2021. The FCC, now newly organized following the inauguration of President Joe Biden, has yet\nto issue a decision in response to these petitions. To the extent the courts, the agencies or the states do not\nuphold or adopt sufficient safeguards to protect against discriminatory conduct, network operators may seek to\nextract fees from us or our\n44\ncontent publishers to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in blocking, throttling or other discriminatory\npractices, and our business could be harmed.\nSeveral states have adopted or are considering network neutrality legislation or regulation. For example,\nCalifornia’s legislation codifies portions of the FCC’s rescinded Open Internet Order. The U.S. Department of\nJustice filed suit in September 2018 to block implementation of the California law, and the California Attorney\nGeneral agreed to delay implementation of the state law until the litigation is resolved. While the Department of\nJustice withdrew its challenge of the California net neutrality law in February 2021, the status of state net\nneutrality legislation remains uncertain because several broadband service provider trade associations also have\nsued California to invalidate its net neutrality law on grounds that the law is preempted by the Order, among other\nclaims. Several states in addition to California have enacted net neutrality legislation and several governors have\nsigned executive orders requiring broadband internet access service providers contracting with state agencies to\nadhere to network neutrality principles. The regulatory framework for network neutrality thus remains unsettled and\nis subject to ongoing federal litigation as well as federal and state legislative and regulatory activity.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or\napplications could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nBroadband internet providers are subject to government regulation and enforcement actions, and changes in current\nor future laws, regulations or enforcement actions that negatively impact our distributors or content publishers\ncould harm our business.\nUpon the effective date of the FCC’s Restoring Internet Freedom Order, the FTC became the federal agency primarily\nresponsible for regulating broadband privacy and data security in the United States. The FTC follows an\nenforcement-focused approach to regulating broadband privacy and security. Future FTC enforcement actions could\ncause us or our content publishers to alter advertising claims or alter or eliminate certain features or\nfunctionalities of our products or services which may harm our business. At the FCC, many broadband internet\nproviders provide traditional telecommunications services that are subject to FCC and state rate regulation of\nintrastate telecommunications services, and are recipients of federal universal service fund payments, which are\nintended to subsidize telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. Changes in rate regulations\nor in universal service funding rules, either at the federal or state level, could affect these broadband internet\nproviders’ revenue and capital spending plans. In addition, various international regulatory bodies have\njurisdiction over non-United States broadband internet providers. The Nevada SPI Law and the CCPA also apply to\nbroadband internet providers that do business in Nevada and California, respectively. To the extent these broadband\ninternet providers are adversely affected by laws or regulations regarding their business, products or service\nofferings, our business could be harmed.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of\neligible service providers for caching, hosting or linking to, user content that includes materials that infringe\ncopyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by the DMCA in conducting our business. Similarly,\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) protects online distribution platforms, such as ours,\nfrom actions taken under various laws that might otherwise impose liability on the platform provider for what\ncontent creators develop or the actions they take or inspire.\nHowever, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines that rely on or may rely on in the future, in\nthe United States or international jurisdiction where we may operate, are subject to uncertain judicial\ninterpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. For example, the FCC Chair under President Trump said the\nFCC would seek comment on a petition for rulemaking filed by the National Telecommunications and Information\nAdministration that sought to limit the scope of protection provided to online distribution platforms under Section\n230. Since then, however, the acting FCC Chair appointed by President Biden has said the FCC will not seek comment\non the NTIA petition. Regulatory or legislative changes, whether in the United States or in international\njurisdictions where we may operate, may ultimately\n45\nrequire us to take a different approach towards content moderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth,\nbreadth, and variety of content we offer and, in so doing, reduce our advertising revenue or user base.\nMoreover, the DMCA and Section 230 provide protections primarily in the United States. If the rules around these\nstatutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections or if a court\nwere to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could incur liability and our business\ncould be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of the content that is streamed over or\nthe advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these\nclaims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our business. Our\ninsurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may be imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform. While our platform policies\nprohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the copyright holder, and we maintain\nprocesses and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in certain instances our platform has\nbeen misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted content. If content owners or\ndistributors are influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and are deterred from working with\nus as a consequence, this could impair our ability to maintain or expand our business, including through\ninternational expansion plans.\nOur involvement in any such legal matters now or in the future, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses\nand other costs, and be disruptive to our business.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock may be\nadversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are\nunable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is\nunable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock\nexchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require\nadditional financial and management resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a\nsignificant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions\ncompleted before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, we adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)(“ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective\nmethod. We applied the revenue standard to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We\nrecognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance\nof retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the\naccounting standards in effect for the prior periods. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to\naccounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm our business.\n46\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the collection of sales tax and payment of income\ntaxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses,\npenalties and fees as a result of our noncompliance, which could harm our business.\nBy engaging in business activities in the United States, we become subject to various jurisdiction laws and\nregulations, including requirements to collect sales tax from our sales within those jurisdictions, and the payment\nof income taxes on revenue generated from activities in those jurisdictions. The laws and regulations governing the\ncollection of sales tax for sales on our website and payment of income taxes are numerous, complex, and vary by\njurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were required to collect sales or other\ntaxes or to pay income taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax liabilities, fees and expenses,\nincluding substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nReforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for U.S. politicians, and key members of the\nlegislative and executive branches, and a wide variety of changes has been proposed or enacted. Certain changes to\nU.S. tax laws could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash equivalent balances\nwe maintain outside the United States. Additionally, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities\nmay increase our worldwide effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay and harm our business.\nLegislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), as modified by legislation\nenacted on March 27, 2020, entitled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”),\nsignificantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act,\nalters U.S. federal tax rates, imposes additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the\nexpensing of certain capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation\nto a territorial system. Additionally, the TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act, has both positive and negative\nchanges to the utilization of future net operating loss carryforwards. For example, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in\ntaxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such\nU.S. federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. The U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly\nimpact how we will apply the law, which could affect our financial position and result of operations. It is\nuncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA and the CARES Act.\nIn addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices\nthat impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming\nservices and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption,\nvalue added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in\nliability for third-party obligations. For example, Maryland recently passed legislation establishing a tax on\ncertain advertising activities and in the EU, certain member states, and other countries have adopted or proposed\ntaxes on digital advertising and marketplace service revenue. The OECD and G-20 are currently engaged in\nnegotiations over an Inclusive Framework on “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS). The talks particularly\ntarget digital businesses, involve 135 countries, and could significantly alter the rules on international taxation\nof multinational enterprises. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional\ntaxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from\nthe failure to comply with any collection obligations. The United States has threatened to impose retaliatory\nduties under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on imports from countries that adopt DSTs, which could result in\nincreased trade tensions and potential retaliation by foreign governments against U.S. digital services or\ntechnologies.\nWe continue to examine the impact these and other tax reforms may have on our business. The impact of these and\nother tax reforms is uncertain and one or more of these or similar measures could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations and\nproceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nway that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government\nentities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees, may\n47\nrequire us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other penalties or\nsanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us\nto incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business. For example, in the\npast, we responded to requests for information made by staff from the SEC.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial\npublic offering, including our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, and limiting your\nability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding\nshares of our common stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the\nholders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power\nof our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent as little as 10% of all outstanding\nshares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence\ncorporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could\nbe adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31,\n2020, Mr. Wood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though\nhe only owns 13% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary\nduty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests\nof our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Wood is entitled to vote his shares in\nhis own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. This concentrated\ncontrol could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially\nall of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the\nconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also\ndiscourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to\nthe Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our\nClass A common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nloss by us of key content publishers;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our devices or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n48\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures\nor\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our\nfinancial performance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nsales of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could\nresult in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\nemployees, other service providers, and directors are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,\nat the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These employees, service providers and\ndirectors may also sell shares during a closed window periods pursuant to trading plans that comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it\nwould be dilutive to existing stockholders and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock. If securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our\nstock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If\none or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly,\ndemand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n49\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market, may increase legal and financial\ncompliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to\nvarying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is\nprovided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws,\nregulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a\ndiversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may\ninitiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of\nDirectors, on committees of our Board of Directors or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our outstanding Credit Agreement contains prohibitions\non the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A\ncommon stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third-party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Roku, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected\nat one time;\npermitting the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly\ncreated directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement\na stockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\n50\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nand the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all\ndisputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable\njudicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nis the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws;\nor any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides\nthat the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any\ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. In December 2018, the Delaware Chancery\nCourt issued a ruling invalidating such provision, which we appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware.\nIn March 2020, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware reversed the ruling of the Delaware Chancery Court and\nheld that the federal forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is facially valid.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs\nassociated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will\nbe enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum\nprovision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an\naction, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions, all of which could harm our business."

                "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Report. In\naddition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020\nand 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in\nthis Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019\nfiled with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nOverview\nWe operate in two revenue segments: the platform segment and the player segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising and related services, content distribution services, subscription and transaction\nrevenue shares, Premium Subscriptions, billing services, sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls and\nlicensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer revenue is generated primarily from the sale of streaming players. We expect to continue to manage the\naverage selling prices (“ASP”) of our streaming players to increase our active accounts. As a result, player\nrevenues may not increase as they have historically. We expect that the tradeoff from player gross profit to grow\nactive accounts will result in increased platform monetization and gross profit.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe widespread global impact from the outbreak and spread of the novel strain of coronavirus referred to as\nCOVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, continued through the end\nof 2020. Precautionary measures to slow down the spread of the virus that were put in place by governmental\nauthorities had eased in many locations but were re-instated in many geographies during the fourth quarter. We\ncontinue to have the majority of our workforce work from home to protect the health and safety of our employees and\ntravel has been severely curtailed.The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting precautionary measures, have caused,\nand are expected to continue to cause, economic uncertainty both in the U.S. and globally as well as significant\nvolatility in, and disruption to, financial markets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to accelerate the shift of TV viewing\naway from traditional pay TV to streaming TV resulting in a faster growth of our active accounts and an increase in\nstreaming hours. Although the growth in streaming hours per account moderated during the third quarter, streaming\nhours per account accelerated again during the fourth quarter to 17.0 billion hours. Despite advertising slowdown\nduring the second quarter that we experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the fourth quarter we had\nstrong platform revenue growth driven by advertising spend and the expansion of content distribution partnerships.\nWe believe advertising budgets will continue to shift from traditional linear TV to streaming TV and that we will\nbenefit from this shift due to our advanced advertising capabilities. Major content publishers continue to re-\norganize around streaming and as a result, our content distribution business has benefited as our rapid rate of\nactive accounts growth was accompanied by strong consumer demand for ad-supported viewing, subscription services\nand premium movie rentals. While we have experienced an increase in TV streaming during the COVID-19 pandemic and\nour business generally has generally, there can be no assurance that these patterns will continue into 2021.\nDespite the adverse impact COVID-19 pandemic has had on global supply chains, we have largely been able to maintain\ninventory of our players, audio products and accessories in stock at retailers and online stores. During the fourth\nquarter, player sales moderated due to the impact of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and ongoing economic\nuncertainty on holiday sales and consumer demand. While our player and Roku TV model sales have remained strong\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that these patterns will continue throughout the pandemic\nor beyond.\n56\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our future operations and financial performance remains uncertain, we\nare continuing to monitor our operating expenses and capital expenditures and are committed to investing in\nstrategic areas to grow our business and extend our competitive advantages.\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, active accounts, streaming hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nactive accounts as they stream content on our platform. The majority of our gross profit is generated from our\nplatform segment.\nOur gross profit was $808.2 million and $495.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nactive accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the number of unique individuals who\nactively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an account. For example, a single account\nmay be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account may be used on multiple streaming\ndevices.\nWe had 51.2 million and 36.9 million active accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020,\nthe fastest growing source of new accounts was licensing arrangements with our Roku TV brand partners and other\nservice operators, which collectively accounted for 62% of new accounts, up from 56% in 2019.\nHours Streamed\nWe believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices\nstream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed on non-Roku platforms are not included in this\nmetric. We report streaming hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue from content\npublishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming hours does\nnot correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis. Moreover,\nstreaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku player or a Roku TV is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming channel may\nauto-play subsequent content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also\noccurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we completed the deployment across all of our devices of a new Roku OS feature\nthat is designed to identify when content has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of\ntime without user interaction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts\nthe user to confirm that they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not\nrespond affirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our\ncustomers, channel partners and advertisers. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have\nimplemented similar features within\n57\ntheir channels. This Roku OS feature supplements these channel features. This feature has not had and is not\nexpected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nWe streamed 58.7 billion and 37.8 billion hours during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote About Our Streaming Hours Adjustments\nTo calculate and report our streaming hours, we utilize data from event logs generated by the firmware running on\nthe Roku devices that are recorded in a central database. The event information (play, pause, stop, time counts,\netc.) is generated by the firmware running on the Roku streaming devices, and event data is transmitted to our\ncentral database at regular intervals when a device is connected to the internet. Pause time is not intended to be\nincluded in streaming hours.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020 we discovered that some pause time was inadvertently included in the streaming\nhours information recorded in our central database. Upon discovering these errors in the log data, we promptly\nreviewed and analyzed the issue utilizing our firmware, data engineering and core analytics teams. We concluded\nthat certain past Roku OS releases inadvertently caused the logging errors. The error rates varied over time and\nacross different types of devices and firmware versions. As a result, we reported higher streaming hours and\nstreaming hours growth rates for the affected periods than we would have if all pause time had been excluded from\nstreaming hours as we had intended. Neither these logging errors, nor the resulting adjustments that we made to our\nstreaming hours calculations, has had any impact on our financial results, and do not require us to revise any of\nour previously reported key operating metrics other than streaming hours.\nThe affected log data was for the periods from February 2016 to August 2020. After adjusting for logging errors, we\nestimate that our streaming hours were, on average, approximately 0.5% lower than previously reported for the\nperiod January 2017 through September 2018, and approximately 5.8% lower for the period October 2018 through March\n2020.\nBy the end of August 2020, we fully deployed a software update that addressed the root cause of the pause time\nlogging errors and prevented them from continuing.\nThe roll out of the “Are you still watching” feature had no impact on the adjustments we made to our streaming\nhours calculations. While our revenue from content publishers is not based on the hours streamed on their streaming\nchannels, and the number of streaming hours does not directly correlate to revenue earned from such content\npublishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis; we believe that the growth in the number of hours of content\nstreamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the growing user demand for TV streaming. After\nadjusting our streaming hours as discussed above, our estimated year-over-year streaming hour growth rates for\nfiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2019 versus fiscal year 2018 and the first quarter of 2020\nversus the first quarter of 2019 were 60.5%, 59.3% and 46.8%, respectively. The estimated year-over-year streaming\nhour growth rate for the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019 was 65%.\nThe following table presents the estimated impacts on streaming hours (in billions) for periods from January 1,\n2017 through March 31, 2020 and streaming hours growth rates on a year-over-year (“YoY”) basis by quarter for\nperiods from January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and annually for fiscal year 2018 and 2019. Revised streaming\nhours for 2016 are not estimated and therefore revised 2017 YoY growth rates are not available.\n58\nQuarter  Published SHs  Revised SHs  SHs % Delta  Published YoY  Revised YoY\n2017 Q1  3.3B           3.2B         -0.5%        63.4%          NA\n2017 Q2  3.5B           3.5B         -0.4%        60.0%          NA\n2017 Q3  3.8B           3.8B         -0.4%        57.8%          NA\n2017 Q4  4.3B           4.3B         -0.2%        55.3%          NA\n2018 Q1  5.1B           5.1B         -0.5%        56.0%          56.1%\n2018 Q2  5.5B           5.4B         -0.5%        57.2%          57.0%\n2018 Q3  6.2B           6.1B         -0.7%        62.7%          62.1%\n2018 Q4  7.3B           7.1B         -2.2%        68.6%          65.2%\n2019 Q1  8.9B           8.4B         -5.4%        74.1%          65.5%\n2019 Q2  9.4B           8.8B         -6.0%        72.1%          62.6%\n2019 Q3  10.3B          9.6B         -6.5%        67.6%          57.9%\n2019 Q4  11.7B          10.9B        -6.3%        60.2%          53.7%\n2020 Q1  13.2B          12.3B        -7.0%        49.3%          46.8%\nYear     Published SHs  Revised SHs  SHs % Delta  Published YoY  Revised YoY\n2017     14.8B          14.8B        -0.4%        58.8%          NA\n2018     24.0B          23.7B        -1.1%        61.7%          60.5%\n2019     40.3B          37.8B        -6.1%        67.8%          59.3%\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $28.76 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $23.14 as of December 31, 2019.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nRate of TV streaming and advertising shift to OTT\nConsumers have significantly shifted their TV viewing behavior, and we believe that someday all TV content will be\nstreamed. We also believe this presents a large market opportunity for digital advertising. This shift in viewing\nbehavior is a critical component of our business model because our platform revenue and player revenue, as well as\nour overall expense structure, is dependent on this shift. In addition, the number of hours streamed on our\nplatform is a critical element of our business because user engagement with our platform generates our advertising\ninventory and determines our advertising sell through.\nUser acquisition strategy\nWe acquire users through three primary ways: our TV brand partners sell Roku TVs through our Roku TV licensing\nprogram, we sell streaming players, and we have licensing relationships with service operators. We monetize our\nuser base through platform revenue. Player revenue and player gross profit have decreased, and may continue to\ndecrease, over time as we strategically aim to acquire new users through the sale of lower priced streaming\nplayers.\nAbility to monetize users and streaming hours\nOur business model is to increase both active accounts and streaming hours while growing revenue and gross profit\nthrough the monetization of our streaming platform. We believe we have a significant opportunity to grow platform\nrevenue as we further monetize our users’ engagement. Our platform makes it easy for content publishers to\ndistribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary business models: transaction video on demand\n(“TVOD”) that includes channels that offer a la carte movie purchases or rentals, subscription video on demand\n(“SVOD”) that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand channels and so-called virtual multichannel\nvideo programming distribution services, and advertising supported video on demand (“AVOD”) that includes channels\nthat do not charge a subscription\n59\nfee to users. We generate revenue from TVOD and SVOD channels from various forms of revenue sharing arrangements.\nOur revenue sharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services\nand to movie rentals or purchases for TVOD. Through our platform we also are able to offer content partners with\nbilling services which support in-channel purchases including movie purchases, rentals, and subscriptions.\nRevenue from the distribution of AVOD channels is generated through the sale of advertising within the channel. We\nare increasing the monetization of these streaming hours by expanding our advertising capabilities both on and off\nour platform. We intend to continue to leverage our data and analytics to deliver relevant advertising and improve\nthe ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure their results. We also plan to continue to\nexpand our direct sales teams to increase the number of advertisers who use our services. The Roku Channel offers\nfree, ad-supported access for users to a selection of films, television series and other content. The Roku Channel\nis a source of digital advertising inventory under our control and is another way that we connect content\npublishers with users. The Roku Channel provides customers with free access to over 50,000 titles, including hit\nHollywood movies, TV episodes, news channels and more and is rapidly becoming one of our leading sources of\nadvertising inventory. In January 2019, we launched Premium Subscriptions within The Roku Channel, through which we\nresell ad-free premium content subscription services from providers such as Showtime, Starz, and Epix.\nContinued investment in growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to improve the value for users, content publishers and advertisers on our\nplatform. We must regularly update and enrich our platform to meet evolving consumer behavior and deliver a\nsuperior experience for our users, content publishers and advertisers. Further, it is important that we remain a\nplatform for content delivery and invest to provide content publishers with best-in-class publishing tools and\nactionable audience insights. We must continue to innovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and\ntechnology so that we attract and encourage incremental advertising spend on our platform. Accordingly, we plan to\ncontinue investing in our business to enhance our competitive differentiation and seed future growth. In\nparticular, these investments will include: Research and Development initiatives to bring new features, technology,\nand content to our platform; Sales and Marketing efforts to drive increased scale and engagement of our user base;\nand building out our General and Administrative infrastructure to support a global scale business.\nSeasonality\nIn the fourth quarter of each calendar year, we generally generate significantly higher levels of revenue and gross\nprofit from platform segment revenue and significantly higher levels of player segment revenue. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, fourth quarter revenue comprised 37% and 36% of our total net revenue, respectively,\nand fourth quarter gross profit comprised 38% and 33% of our total gross profit, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from advertising sales and related services, subscription and transaction revenue\nsharing arrangements with partners, the sale of Premium Subscription services, sales of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls and licensing arrangements with service operators. Our first-party video ad inventory includes The\nRoku Channel, native display ads on our home screen and screen saver as well as ad inventory we obtain through our\ncontent distribution agreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-sell video inventory that we purchase\nfrom content publishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party inventory on a revenue share basis. To\ndate, we have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nPlayer Revenue\nWe generate player revenue primarily from the sale of streaming players through consumer retail distribution\nchannels, including major brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and Walmart, and online retailers, including\nAmazon. We generate most of our player revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily\nsell our\n60\nplayers through wholesale distributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers. We currently distribute our players in\nCanada, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Mexico, Brazil and several other Latin American\ncountries.\nPlayer revenue also includes the sale of our audio products, including wireless speakers, smart soundbars and\nwireless subwoofers.\nCost ofRevenue\nCost of Platform Revenue\nCost of platform revenue consists of costs associated with arrangements with content partners and publishers\nincluding advertising inventory and content or programming licensing fees. Cost of platform revenue also includes\npayment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the delivery of our services including salaries,\nbenefits and stock-based compensation for our operations and support teams, third-party cloud services and\namortization of acquired technology.\nCost of Player Revenue\nCost of player revenue is comprised mostly of player manufacturing costs payable to our third-party contract\nmanufacturer and technology licenses or royalty fees. Cost of player revenue also includes inbound and outbound\nfreight, duty and logistics costs, third-party packaging and allocated overhead costs related to facilities and\ncustomer support, and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and\nstock-based compensation for our development teams as well as outsourced development fees. In addition, research\nand development expenses include allocated facilities and overhead costs. We expect research and development\nexpenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform, player and TV\nproducts, advertising products and other platform services.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits,\ncommissions and stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing,\ncommunications, data science and analytics, business development, product management and partner and customer\nsupport functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include marketing, retail and merchandising costs and\nallocated facilities and overhead expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars\nin future periods as we focus on growing active accounts, platform and player revenues, and expanding our business\ninternationally.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our\nexecutive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the expansion of\nour business and related infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on cash and cash\nequivalents, interest expense that primarily includes interest on our Credit Facility (as defined in ‘Liquidity and\nCapital Resources’ below) and amortization of deferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement and transaction\ngains and losses. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,other income (expense), net consists of interest\nincome on short-term investments and cash balances, interest expense that primarily includes amortization of\ndeferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement and transaction gains and losses.\n61\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nOur income tax (benefit) expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have a valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax\nassets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development.\nWe expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020        2019        2018\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                 71  %       66  %       56  %\nPlayer                                                   29  %       34  %       44  %\nTotal net revenue                                       100  %      100  %      100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                 28  %       23  %       16  %\nPlayer                                                   27  %       33  %       39  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                    55  %       56  %       55  %\nGross Profit:\nPlatform                                                 43  %       43  %       40  %\nPlayer                                                    2  %        1  %        5  %\nTotal gross profit                                       45  %       44  %       45  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                 20  %       24  %       23  %\nSales and marketing                                      17  %       16  %       14  %\nGeneral and administrative                               10  %       10  %       10  %\nTotal operating expenses                                 47  %       50  %       47  %\nLoss from Operations                                     (2  )%      (6  )%      (2  )%\nOther Income, Net:\nOther income, net                                         —  %        1  %        1  %\nTotal other income, net                                   —  %        1  %        1  %\nLoss before income taxes                                 (2  )%      (5  )%      (1  )%\nIncome tax (benefit) expense                              —  %        —  %        —  %\nNet loss attributable to common                          (2  )%      (5  )%      (1  )%\nstockholders\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet Revenue\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2020            2019       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 1,267,744    $    740,776    $   526,968          71  %\nPlayer                                                    510,644         388,145        122,499          32  %\nTotal Net Revenue                     $                 1,778,388    $  1,128,921    $   649,467          58  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $527.0 million, or 71%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2019. The increase is mostly attributable to higher advertising revenues, including revenue from\n62\nour demand-side platform, which we acquired fromdataxuin November 2019. In 2020,were-brandedour demand-side\nplatformas the OneView Ad Platform and integrateditwith Roku-native identity, data and attribution tools.

During the year ended December 31, 2020,the\nvolume of streaming players sold increased 28% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 offset by a 3%\ndecrease in the average selling price of players. The increase in the volume of players sold was due to an increase\nin demand for lower priced models, namely the Roku Express player and the Roku Premiere player, and in part to\nconsumers spending more time at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCost of Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue:                                             2020          2019       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                   503,177    $  262,655    $   240,522          92  %\nPlayer                                                    466,992       371,042         95,950          26  %\nTotal Cost of Revenue                 $                   970,169    $  633,697    $   336,472          53  %\nGross profit:\nPlatform                              $                   764,567    $  478,121    $   286,446          60  %\nPlayer                                                     43,652        17,103         26,549         155  %\nTotal Gross Profit                    $                   808,219    $  495,224    $   312,995          63  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of platform revenue increased by $240.5 million, or 92%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related\ncosts of $29.2 millionrelated to increased headcount of 27% and related stock-based compensation, an increase of\n$16.1 million related to higher legal, consulting and professional service fees, an increase of $5.1 million\nrelated to higher facilities costs, an increase of $3.1 million in allowance for doubtful accounts primarily from\nadoption of accounting standard for credit losses, and a net increase of $3.3 million that includes various\ncorporate expenses and overheads partly offset by a decrease in travel expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Income (Expenses), Net\n(in thousands, except             Years Ended December 31,\npercentages)                                          2020            2019          Change $       Change %\nInterest expense               $                    (3,432  )    $  (2,366  )    $  (1,066    )          45  %\nOther income (expense), net                          5,233           6,506          (1,273    )         (20  )%\nTotal Other Income             $                     1,801       $   4,140       $  (2,339    )         (56  )%\n(Expense), Net\n64\nOther income (expenses), net\nTotal other income (expense), net, decreased by $2.3 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2019.Interest expense, including amortization of deferred debt costs, was higher for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher level of borrowings under our Credit Facility as compared to the\nprior year. Other income, net was $1.3 million lower in the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income declined\n$2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a significant drop in interest rates early in the year in\nreaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our investment yields. This was offset by favorable foreign\nexchange totaling $1.4 million primarily related to the British Pound.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expenses\n(in thousands, except                  Years Ended December 31,\npercentages)                           2020                              2019          Change $    Change %\nIncome tax (benefit) expense        $  (945                      )    $  (982  )    $        37    (4        )%\nIncome tax benefit\nIncome tax benefit arises from foreign income taxes and state income taxes in the United States.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,092.8 million. Approximately 1.2% of our cash was\nheld outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries which are used to fund foreign\noperations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and player revenue and proceeds from equity sales including\nequity issued pursuant to our employee stock option plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of revenue including\nthird party manufacturing costs, costs to acquire advertising inventory, and content and programming license fees\nas well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting and professional service fees, and\nfacility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment.\nWe have multi-year lease agreements for office space and incurred material expenses in 2020. We expect to continue\nto incur material expenses for facility and building related costs forour campus headquarters in San Jose,\nCalifornia as well as at other office locations in the U.S. and internationally. As our business and workforce\ncontinue to expand, we further expect ongoing purchases of computer systems and other investments in property and\nequipment. In addition, we may pursue merger and acquisition activities, including the acquisition of rights to\nprogramming and content assets that could materially impact our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and our undrawn available balance\nunder our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve\nmonths. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be\naffected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk\nFactors and the effects of the COVD-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has not severely impacted our liquidity and\ncapital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital and\ncredit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Our\nCredit Agreement expires in February 2023. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and also to restrictive covenants.\n65\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn May 13, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Inc., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 4.0 million shares of our Class\nA common stock and received gross proceeds of $504.0 millionat an average selling price of $126.01 per share and\nincurred issuance costs of $6.8 million.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019 (the “Original Closing Date”), we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Existing Credit\nAgreement”) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. On May 3, 2019, (the “Closing Date”), the Existing Credit\nAgreement was amended pursuant to an Incremental Assumption and Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment” and the Existing\nCredit Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”).\nThe Credit Agreement provides for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up\nto $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan A facility in the\naggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”) and (iii) an uncommitted\nincremental facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial and other conditions, in the amount of up to\n(v) $50.0 million, plus (w) 1.0x of our consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter\nperiod, plus (x) an additional amount at our discretion, so long as, on a pro forma basis at the time of\nincurrence, our secured leverage ratio does not exceed 1.50 to 1.00, plus (y) voluntary prepayments of the\nRevolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility to the extent accompanied by concurrent reductions to the\napplicable Credit Facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A Facility, collectively,\nthe “Credit Facility”).\nFor our current borrowings, we have elected a Eurodollar borrowing with interest at a rate equal to the adjusted\none-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our secured leverage ratio. The borrowings under\nthe facility mature or have to repaid in full by February 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are\nsecured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants, a financial covenant that is tested quarterly and requires us to\nmaintain a certain adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, and customary events of default.As of December\n31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 10 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements in Item 8 of this Report, for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $30.8 million and $30.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, respectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2020              2019\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   148,192       $    13,707\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities                        (81,324  )       (110,295  )\nCash flows provided by financing                               509,048           458,328\nactivities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $148.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net loss of\n$17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $225.7 million comprising\nmainly of $134.1 million of stock-based compensation, $36.2 million of depreciation and amortization primarily on\nproperty and equipment and acquired intangible assets, $28.7 million of amortization of operating lease right-of-\nuse assets, $22.4 million of amortization of capitalized licensed content assets and $3.8 million of provision for\ndoubtful accounts. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities used cash of $60.0 million comprised\nofoutflows of $196.0 million from an increase in accounts receivableprimarily driven by higher sales volume in the\nlast quarter, $4.2 million from increased inventory levels\n66\nat the end of the year, $3.5 million from an increase in prepaid and other current assetsdue to an increase in\ncontract assets, prepaid taxes and other general expenses, and $1.1 million from an increase in other long term\nassets. These outflows were offset by cash inflows by an increase of $103.2 million from an increase in accrued\nliabilitiesrelated to content publisher payables,marketing, retail and merchandising costs, advertising inventory\ncostsand overall growth in the volume of business,$21.5 million from an increase in deferred revenue due to overall\ngrowth in the volume of business,$13.0 million from an increase in operating lease liabilities for new leases added\nduring the year, $6.4 million from an increase in accounts payable, and $0.6 million from an increase in other\nlong-term liabilities.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss of $59.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $127.9 million comprising mainly\nof $85.2 million of stock-based compensation and $15.7 million of depreciation and amortization primarily on\nproperty and equipment and acquired intangible assets, $22.3 million of amortization of operating right-of-use\nassets and $2.9 million of amortization of capitalized licensed content assets. The changes in our operating assets\nand liabilities used cash of $54.2 million comprised of outflows of $110.2 million from an increase in accounts\nreceivable due to increased seasonal revenues in the fourth quarter, $14.1 million from increasing inventory\nlevels, $10.6 million from a decrease in deferred revenue, $9.9 million from an increase in prepaid and other\ncurrent assets due to an increasein prepaid contracts, marketing expenses and prepaid capital expenditure for new\nfacilities, $3.0 million from a decrease in other long-term liabilities, and $3.0 million from an increase in other\nlong-term assets. These outflows were offset by cash inflows of $74.5 million from an increase in accrued\nliabilities due to timing of payments, increased content publishers payables, and overall growth in the volume of\nbusiness,$11.7 million from an increase in operating lease liabilities, $9.4 million from an increase in accounts\npayable, and $1.1 million from a decrease in deferred cost of revenue.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities used cash of $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash used comprised\nof $82.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment, which primarily related to expenditures on leasehold\nimprovements related to expanding our facilities and other capital investments, partially offset by $1.1 million of\ncash received from proceeds from the resolution of purchase acquisition contingencies.\nOur investing activities used cash of $110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash used comprised\nof $77.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment, which primarily related to expenditures on leasehold\nimprovements related to expanding our facilities and other capital investments, $68.1 million related to the\nacquisition of dataxu, Inc., $12.4 million spent on the purchase of short-term investments, and $7.4 million\nrelated to the purchases of other intangible assets, partially offset by $54.8 million received from\nsales/maturities of short-term investments.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $509.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash was\nreceived mainly from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our at-the-market offering amounting to\n$497.2 million, net of offering costs and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $16.8 million. We\nborrowed and repaid $69.3 million of our Revolving Credit Facility in addition to the repayments of $5.0 million on\nour Term Loan A during the year.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $458.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash was\nreceived mainly from net proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock through our at-the-market offerings\namounting to $330.5 million, net of offering costs, proceeds from borrowings amounting to $99.6 million, net of\nissuance costs, and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $28.2 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as defined by\napplicable SEC rules and regulations.\n67\nContractual Obligations\nOur future minimum payments under our non-cancelable contractual obligations were as follows as of December 31,\n2020 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period       Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\nTotal          1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nTerm Loan A Facility       $                  95,000    $      5,000    $   90,000    $       —    $          —\n(1)\nPurchase commitments                         185,945         185,945             —            —               —\n(2)\nOperating lease                              440,645          50,889        94,974       92,930         201,852\nobligations (3)\nOther obligations (4)                         70,990          42,574        26,376        2,040               —\nTotal                      $                 792,580    $    284,408    $  211,350    $  94,970    $    201,852\nRepresents the principal amount of Term Loan A Facility.

Consistent with\nindustry practices, we enter into firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments to acquire products\nthrough a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand\ninformation. Our contract manufacturer sources components and builds our products based on these demand forecasts.\nChanges to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our products, may result in us being committed to\npurchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in\nthe table above.\nAs we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits, net, the table does not include $29.2 million of such non-current liabilities not included in our\nconsolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions\nare affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic\nenvironment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations may require significant\njudgment.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation.\nFor performance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales.\nFor those\n68\nperformance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that may include\nmarket conditions and other observable inputs.\nTo the extent platform services are part of multiple element arrangement, revenue recognition of each performance\nobligation in the estimated transaction price of a contract is based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur player revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price. The\nestimates for returns and sales incentives are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We\nprovide unspecified upgrades and updates to our player end users. We record the allocated value of these as\ndeferred revenue and recognize it ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the\nassociated players. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at\nfair value on the date of acquisition. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\nthe useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\nintangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and\noutflows, expected technology life cycle, attrition rates of customers, and discount rates. We estimate the useful\nlives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit\nfrom the asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately\nvalue assets and liabilities acquired, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a\nresult, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments\nto the assets and liabilities acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent we identify\nadjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the values of assets and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments\nare recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when specific\ncircumstances dictate, between annual tests. We measure recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level. The\nprocess of determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly subjective and involves the use of significant\nestimates and assumptions. In performing our annual assessment, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to\ntest a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on our\nqualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is, more likely than not, less\nthan its carrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit's\ncarrying amount over its fair value will be recorded as an impairment loss.\nWe identify intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determine their fair value. The determination\ninvolves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an\nasset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate discount weighted-average cost of capital. We\namortize purchased-intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We\nreview purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is\nshorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such\nfacts and circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of\npurchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected\n69\nundiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset group against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment,\nif any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of these asset groups. If the useful life\nof the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the\nremaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nAllowances for Sales Returns, Sales Incentives and Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives and\ndoubtful accounts which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts\nreceivable. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical experience, promotional\nprograms, claims to date and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nWe assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist\nand on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with collectability issues and determine the\nallowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly review the allowance by considering historical collectability based\non past due status, credit quality, and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing\ncredit evaluations. We consider customer-specific information and current economic conditions that may affect a\ncustomer’s ability to pay.\nIf our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual results, the losses or gains,\ncould be material.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized\nas an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of\nthe respective award. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment.\nWe account for the fair value of restricted stock units using the closing market price of our Class A common stock\non the date of the grant.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of\nthe grant date fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock\nfair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables\ninclude our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and\ncancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. We use the closing market price for our Class A common stock as reported on\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the\nstock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the\nsimplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the\nvesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to\nprovide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term.\nVolatility. As we do not have sufficient trading history for our Class A common stock, the expected\nvolatility for our Class A common stock is estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for\nindustry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock\noption awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar\nin size, stage of life cycle or financial leverage. We intend to consistently apply this process until a\nsufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own Class A common stock share\nprice becomes available or unless circumstances change such that the identified peer companies are no longer\nsimilar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are available would be utilized in\nthe calculation.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with\nmaturities similar to the expected term for each of our stock options.\n70\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nWe account for forfeitures as they occur. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes\nsignificantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted\npreviously.\nWe will continue to use judgement in evaluating assumptions related to our stock-based compensation cost. As we\ncontinue to accumulate additional data related to our Class A common stock and our business evolves, we may have\nrefinements to our assumptions and estimates which could impact our future stock-based compensation cost.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and\nliability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation\nallowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance to offset domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of\nrealizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. Our\nvaluation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. net operating\nlosses and other deferred tax assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2020 and those not yet adopted are\ndiscussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. They are\nincorporated herein by reference."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash, cash equivalents and interest\nexpense on the Credit Facility. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while\nmaximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest\nrates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility totaled $95.0 million with an effective interest rate\nof 2.03%. If the amount outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility remains at this level for an entire year and\ninterest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease,\nrespectively, by an additional $1.0 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and we have minimal foreign currency risk related to our\nrevenue. In addition, most of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar, resulting in minimal\nforeign currency risks. In the future, if our international revenues increase or more of our expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely be more\nsignificant. For any of the periods presented, we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts. However, in\nthe future, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk.\n71"

In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in\nfiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the\noptional transition method.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit\nof the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that\n(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

For transactional revenue sharing arrangements, the estimate of the variable consideration is based on\nmanagement’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted performance of the publisher’s content\napplication(s). For the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls, the estimate of the variable\nconsideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted player and Roku TV sales\nvolumes.\nWe identified the revenue forecasts relating to content publisher arrangements as a critical audit matter due to\nthe significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration and transaction prices. Such estimates\nrequired a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to content\ndistribution services and branded channel buttons.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\no  Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\nAnalyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\no  recognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract,\nincluding terms and conditions for revenue sharing.\no  Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance and sales departments regarding the\nestimates for sales of branded channel buttons.\no  Evaluated management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to\nactual consideration received.\no  Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\no  Compared management’s forecasts of variable consideration to historical data, other information within the\nCompany, and certain publicly available historical and forecasted industry information, when applicable.\nTested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecast.The critical audit matter communicated\nbelow is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\no  material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments.

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On , Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company’s TV streaming platform\nallows users to easily discover and access a wide variety of movies and TV episodes, as well as live sports, music,\nnews and more. The Company operates in reportable segments and generates platform revenue from advertising, content\ndistribution, audience development, billing services and licensing activities and player revenue from the sale of\nstreaming players and audio products.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior period amounts within cash flow from operations in the statement of cash flows, have been\nreclassified to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net cash provided\nby operating activities for any period reported.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgements, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition,\ndetermining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable consideration, determining\nthe stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue recognition, evaluation of\ncustomer versus vendor relationships, and other obligations such as sales return reserves and sales incentive\nprograms; the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; useful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for doubtful accounts; the valuation of deferred income tax assets; and stock-based compensation. The\nCompany bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe comprehensive loss is equal to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. Comprehensive loss includes\nunrealized gains on the Company’s short-term investments and foreign currency translation adjustments for the year\nended December 31, 2019. Comprehensive loss includes unrealized losses on the Company’s short-term investments for\nthe year ended December 31, 2018. Income taxes on the unrealized gains or losses are not material.\n81\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities\nof these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at rates in effect at period-end and\nnonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at\naverage exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or losses from re-measurement and\ntransaction gains or losses are recorded as other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\noperations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $ million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $ million and $\nmillion, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to\nbe cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, financial institutions managed % and %, respectively, of the\nCompany’s total cash and cash equivalents balance. As of December 31, 2019, the same financial institutions managed\n% and %, respectively, of the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents balance.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives and doubtful accounts. The Company\nperforms ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses and\ndoubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional activities, historical claim\nrate and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales incentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns: Allowance for sales returns consist of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020             2019             2018\nBeginning balance                      $                    (6,550  )    $   (7,335  )    $   (6,907  )\nCharged to revenue                                         (14,594  )       (15,541  )       (17,396  )\nUtilization of sales return reserve                         15,232           16,326           16,968\nEnding balance                         $                    (5,912  )    $   (6,550  )    $   (7,335  )\nAllowance for Sales Incentives: Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020             2019             2018\nBeginning balance                         $                   (19,476  )    $  (13,750  )    $  (10,442  )\nCharged to revenue                                            (68,315  )       (65,676  )       (50,958  )\nUtilization of sales incentive reserve                         56,953           59,950           47,650\nEnding balance                            $                   (30,838  )    $  (19,476  )    $  (13,750  )\n82\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020            2019          2018\nBalance, beginning of period              $                    (1,140  )         (686  )        (63  )\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2016-13                              (1,066  )            —             —\nAdjusted balance, beginning of period                          (2,206  )         (686  )        (63  )\nProvision for doubtful accounts           $                    (3,801  )    $    (704  )    $  (876  )\nAdjustments for recovery and write-off                          1,826             250           253\nBalance, end of period                                         (4,181  )       (1,140  )       (686  )\nCustomer H accounted for % of the accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31, 2020. The Company did t have\nany customer that accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31, 2019.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company determines whether a transaction meets the definition of a business combination before applying the\nacquisition method of accounting to that transaction. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase\nconsideration of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired business is included\nin the Company’s consolidated statement of operations beginning on their effective acquisition date. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and other related charges are recognized separately from the\nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred. Contingent consideration arrangements are recognized at fair\nvalue as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in operations.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during\nthe measurement period, which may be up to from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax\npositions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as\nof the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and\nassumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that\nthe Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination\nof the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values upon acquisition close.\nIntangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not\nlimited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In\nperforming its annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting\nunit’s goodwill for impairment or it can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s\nqualitative assessment, if\n83\nit is determined that the fair value of our reporting unit is, more likely than not, less thanitscarrying amount,\nthen the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair\nvalue is be recorded as an impairment loss.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, intangible assets and capitalized licensed content assets with finite lives\nfor impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. The Company assesses\nthese assets for impairment based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the\nasset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.\nThe Company did t recognize any impairment for goodwill, intangible assets or capitalized licensed content assets\nin any periods reported. The impairments of operating right-of-use assets during the years ended December 31, 2020\nand 2019 were not material.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price of a contract based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales. For\nthose performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on market\nconditions and other observable inputs.\nWhen the Company sells third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the principal, and\nreports revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, the\nCompany considers if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the\ncustomer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and\ndiscretion in establishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services, content\ndistribution services, subscription and transaction revenue shares, Premium Subscriptions, billing services, sale\nof branded channel buttons on remote controls and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\n84\nThe Company sells digital advertising directly to marketers or through advertising agencies. Revenue from\nadvertising is mostly generated through video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions.\nAdvertising is typically sold on a cost-per-thousand (“CPM”) basis and is evidenced by an Insertion Order (“IO”).\nRevenue is recognized as the number of impressions are delivered. IOs may include multiple performance obligations\nas they contain distinct advertising products or services. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to\neach distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company also generates revenue from customers\nusing its platform. For that it charges a platform fee, which is a percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory\nspend during the month, along with data and any add-on features purchased through the platform. The Company\nrecognizes revenue on either a gross or net basis for digital advertising based on its determination as to whether\nit is acting as the principal in the revenue generation process or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal,\nit controls the advertising inventory before it is transferred to its customers. This is further supported by the\nCompany being primarily responsible to its customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nAdvertising arrangements comprised of multiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in time or\nover time depending on the nature of the distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company’s content distribution revenue sharing arrangements include cash or non-cash consideration. The revenue\nsharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the\ntime of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is deemed to be the agent\nbetween content publishers and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, as the services\nare delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the form of advertising\ninventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party data.\nThe Company sells monthly subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such premium subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nto the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based on the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in\nCost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded channel buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to\na publisher’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to TV brands and service operators. The licensing\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time, when the Company makes the intellectual property available and the\ncontrol transfers to the customer. The revenue allocated to unspecified upgrades is recognized on a time elapsed\nbasis, by day, over the service period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are provided or\naccepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nPlayer segment:\nThe Company sells the majority of its players and audio products to retail distribution channels in the U.S.,\nincluding brick and mortar and online retailers, as well as through the Company’s website. Player revenue primarily\nconsists of hardware, embedded software and unspecified upgrades on a when and if-available basis. The hardware and\nembedded software are considered as one performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe control transfers to the customer. Unspecified upgrades or enhancements are available to customers on a when-\nand-if available basis. The Company records the allocated value of the unspecified upgrades as deferred revenue and\nrecognizes it as player revenue ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the associated\nplayers.\nThe Company’s player revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in Revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue.\n85\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance in Leases (Topic 842), using the optional transition method\nand recorded operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities on its consolidated balance\nsheets. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception.Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance\nsheets.ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at\ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the\nlease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The Company takes\ninto consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental borrowing rate.\nThe Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term, when it is\nreasonably certain to exercise one of the options. The Company combines lease and non-lease components into a\nsingle lease component for its real estate and equipment leases.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature.The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between and five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the\n.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the\nCompany capitalized internal-use software development costs of $ million, $ million and $ million, respectively.\nCapitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which\nis generally to , beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. During the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2019 and 2018, the Company amortized expenses of $ million, $ million and $ million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received from licensing and service arrangements, including\nadvertising, that will be recognized as revenue over time or as services are rendered. Deferred revenue balances\nconsist of the amount of player sales allocated to unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a when-and-if available\n86\nbasis, licensing and services fees from service operators and TV brands, and payments from advertisers and content\npublishers. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as current liabilities and the\nremaining is recorded as noncurrent liabilities.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company incurred advertising costs of $ million, $ million and $ million for the\nyears December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nNet Loss per Share\nSince the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted\nnet loss per share for all periods as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding and potentially\ndilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)\n2016-13,Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nThe guidance amended reporting of credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt\nsecurities to require that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather\nthan as a write-down.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective adoption method and recorded\na cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit of approximately $ 1.1million. The\nmeasurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and subsequent changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses are recorded in the statements of operations. This impact mainly relates to credit losses recognized\non the Company’s doubtful accounts. As the Company did not have any available-for-sale debt securities as of the\nadoption date, there was no additional impact to accumulated deficit.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02,Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and\nEntertainment—Broadcasters—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350): Improvements to Accounting for Costs\nof Films and License Agreements for Program Materials, in order to align the accounting for production costs of an\nepisodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the content distinction\nfor capitalization. ASU 2019-02 also requires that an entity reassess estimates of the use of a film in a film\ngroup and account for any changes prospectively. In addition, ASU 2019-02 requires that an entity test films and\nlicense agreements for program material for impairment at a film group level when the film\n87\nor license agreements are predominantly monetized with other films and license agreements. OnJanuary 1, 2020, the\nCompanyadopted the guidance in ASU 2019-02. There wasnomaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe Company also adopted the following ASUs effective January 1, 2020, none of which had a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial position or results of operations.\nASU          Description\nASU 2018-15  Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Topic 350), Customer’s Accounting for\nImplementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\nASU 2018-13  Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements\nfor Fair Value Measurement\nASU 2017-04  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\nASU2019-04   Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments\nFinancial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842)—Amendments to SEC\nASU2020-02   Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on\nEffective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\nASU2020-03   Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04,Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference\nRate Reform on Financial Reporting. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S.\nGAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank\nOffered Rate (“LIBOR”) that is expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. The guidance is\neffective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company made a policy election in the second quarter\nof 2020 to elect a different reference rate for the Credit Agreement when LIBOR is discontinued. It is still\nuncertain when the transition from LIBOR to another reference rate will occur or which reference rate will become\nthe accepted market alternative to LIBOR.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income\nTaxes, to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and\nalso simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial\nstatements and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or rate changes. The guidance is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, with early\nadoption permitted. The Company believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the\nfinancial statements.\n88\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenues are represented by the reportable segments discussed in Note 17.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020          2019          2018\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             523,852    $  332,673    $  183,078\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                     7,431         3,588           753\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                       55,465        39,861        45,442\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   21,283        15,370        19,594\nTotal deferred revenue                   $              76,748    $   55,231    $   65,036\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns,\nand sales incentives. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are generally current in nature and\nare included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.Contract assets increased by $ million during the year\nended December 31, 2020 and by $ million during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in\nthe growth of platform revenue combined with the timing of billing which falls into a subsequent period.\nContract liabilities are included in deferred revenue and reflect consideration invoiced prior to the completion of\nperformance obligations and revenue recognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 due to the increase in estimated values of content publisher and licensing partner\narrangements and change in the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations of approximately $ million, and\nhigher growth in the player segment, resulting in a net increase in deferred revenue related to unspecified\nupgrades of approximately $ million. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $ million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 primarily due to revenue recognized of $ million pursuant to customer acceptance of a\nmilestone,and the remaining revenue recognized primarily relates to thetiming of fulfillment of performance\nobligations.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of December\n31, 2019 was $ million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 from amounts included in\ndeferred revenue as of December 31, 2018 was $ million.\nThe Company recognized $ 14.4million and $ 10.9million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in\ntransaction price of its revenue contracts.\nCustomer C accounted for %, % and % of the total net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018, respectively.\n89\n4. business combination\nOn November 8, 2019, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of dataxu, Inc., (“dataxu”) according to the terms\nand conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 22, 2019(the “Merger Agreement”).dataxu is\na demand-side platform (“DSP”) that enables marketers to plan and buy video ad campaigns. The acquisition of\ndataxu’s platform complements the Company’s OTT advertising platform and enables marketers to access a single,\ndata-driven software solution to plan, buy, and optimize their ad spend across TV and OTT providers.\nThe total purchase consideration for dataxu was $ 147.3million, which consisted of $ 77.6million in cash and $\n69.7million for the fair value of the Company’s 571,459shares of Class A common stock. Pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, the Company had deposited $ 18.8million into an escrow account to secure certain indemnifications and\nother potential obligations. As of the year ended December 31, 2020, a balance of $ 13.6million is unreleased and\nremains in the escrow account.\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on\nacquisition date is based on estimated fair values and is as follows (in thousands):\nEstimated Useful Lives\nAssets acquired                           Fair Values                   (in years)\nCurrent assets                         $       50,829\nRestricted cash                                 1,303\nProperty and equipment, net                     4,503\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped Technology                           56,400                          6.0\nCustomer relationships                         13,400                          4.0\nTradename                                         400                          0.5\nGoodwill                                       71,676\nOperating lease right-of-use assets            24,658\nOther long-term assets                            235\nTotal assets acquired                         223,404\nLiabilities assumed\nCurrent liabilities                           (51,428  )\nOperating lease liabilities                   (24,658  )\nTotal liabilities assumed                     (76,086  )\nTotal purchase consideration           $      147,318\nThe fair value estimates of the net assets acquired are based upon calculations and valuations, and those estimates\nand assumptions regarding certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the total\nconsideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities is recorded as\ngoodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in our advertising offerings and cross-selling\nopportunities.\nThe goodwill recorded is not deductible for tax purposes. In connection with the acquisition, a deferred tax\nliability is established for the book/tax differences related to non-goodwill intangible assets. The deferred tax\nliability is not reflected as the Company also acquired deferred tax assets, including significant net operating\nlosses, that offset the deferred tax liability. Additionally, both companies have full valuation allowances\nrecorded against their respective deferred tax assets, resulting in a net zero adjustment to deferred taxes on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n90\n5.

The licensing arrangements can be for a fixed fee\nor variable fee. The licensing arrangements specify the period when the content is available for streaming. The\nCompany capitalizes the fixed content fees and its corresponding liability when the license period begins, the cost\nof the content is known, and the content is accepted and available for streaming. If the licensing fee is not\ndeterminable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded, and licensing costs are expenses as\nincurred. The Company amortizes licensed content assets into Cost of Revenue, Platform, using the straight-line\nmethod over the contractual period of availability. The liability is paid in accordance with the contractual terms\nof the arrangement. On , the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2019-02, Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film\nCosts (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment—Broadcasters—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350):\nImprovements to Accounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials, on a prospective basis.\nThe adoption did not have material impact on its financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, licensed content assets that met these requirements were $ million and are recorded in\n“Other non-current assets.” As of December 31, 2019, licensed content assets that met these requirements were $\nmillion and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Payments for content, including additions to\ncontent assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within Net cash provided by operating\nactivities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The increase in the content asset is due to a change in\nthe mix of content licensed and the period over which such content is available for streaming. The corresponding\nliability is included in Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities and is discussed in Note 12.\nThe Company recorded amortization expense of $ million and $ million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively, in Cost of revenue, platform in the consolidated statements of operations, related to\ncapitalized licensed content assets.\nYear Ending December 31,\n2021                        6,527\n2022                        1,338\n2023                           42\n93\nLicensed content assets are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The film group is\nevaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than\nthe carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether the group\nasset is impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did t recognize any impairment for capitalized licensed\ncontent assets.\n8.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and to utilize a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used\nto measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts\nreceivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $ million\nand $ million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe Company did not have Level 3 instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-\nuse assets and licensed content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3\ninputs, only when impairment is recognized. The impairments for operating ROU assets recorded by the Company for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not material.\n94\n9.

Generally, stock options granted to employees vest % after and have a term of . Restricted\nstock units generally vest over years. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the amount of stock-\nbased compensation capitalized as part of internal use software was not material.\nThe following table shows total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018 (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020         2019         2018\nCost of platform revenue          $                       847    $     342    $      97\nCost of player revenue                                  1,407        1,072          469\nResearch and development                               58,412       40,036       18,538\nSales and marketing                                    42,846       24,179       10,459\nGeneral and administrative                             30,564       19,546        8,111\nTotal stock-based compensation    $                   134,076    $  85,175    $  37,674\nThe fair value of options granted under the 2008 Plan and 2017 Plan is estimated on the grant date using the Black-\nScholes option-valuation model. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires the Company to\nmake certain assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term,\nthe expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, an assumed risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.\nThe Company uses the straight-line method for expense recognition. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they\noccur.\n99\nFair Value of Common Stock:The Company uses the market closing price for the Class A common stock as reported on\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term: The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected\nto be outstanding and is determined based on the simplified method as described in ASC Topic 718-10-S99-1,SEC\nMaterials SAB Topic 14, Share-Based Payment.\nExpected Volatility: The Company’s volatility factor is estimated using several comparable public company\nvolatilities for similar option terms.\nExpected Dividends: The Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends in\nthe future, and as a result, the expected dividends are $ 0.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate: The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on\nU.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the estimated life of the stock options. Where\nthe expected term of the Company’s stock options does not correspond with the term for which an interest rate is\nquoted, the Company performs a straight-line interpolation to determine the rate from the available term\nmaturities.\nThe assumptions used to value stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as\nfollows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020            2019            2018\nExpected term (in years)                   5.0 - 6.7       5.0 - 6.7       5.3 - 6.8\nRisk-free interest rate                 0.22 - 1.67%    1.35 - 2.56%    2.32 - 2.88%\nExpected volatility                         36 - 39%        35 - 36%        38 - 40%\nDividend rate                                      —               —               —\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.\nIn order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and\nsuppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-\ncancelable. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ million purchase commitments for inventory.\nThe Company records a liability for non-cancelable purchase commitments in excess of projected demand forecasts.\nThe Company recorded $ million and $ million for these purchase commitments in “Accrued liabilities” as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLicense Content Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a liability of $ million in Accrued liabilities and $ million in\nOther long-term liabilities for licensed content that is available for streaming. As of December 31, 2019, the\nCompany recorded $ million as obligations in Accrued liabilities for licensed content that is available for\nstreaming. The increase in content liability is due to change in the mix of content licensed and the period over\nwhich this content is available for streaming.\nThe Company also enters into contracts with content publishers to acquire content or to buy ad inventory in the\nfuture.As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ million in commitments with content publishers for content or to\nbuy ad inventory that are non-cancellable. These commitments include both content that is available\n100\nfor streaming and is recognized as liabilities as well as content that is not yet available for streaming or ad\ninventories not yet purchased.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $\nmillion and $ million, respectively, related to facilities leases. The letters of credit have various expiration\ndates through 2030.\nContingencies\nThe Company accrues for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing claims, when\nit believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable.These contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly\nand adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel\nand other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal proceedings can be,\nhowever, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any loss contingencies that are material.During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, the Company recorded expenses of $ 9.9million, in total cost of revenue, for various claims\nrelated to patent infringements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company changed its estimate of\ncertain liabilities previously recorded for intellectual property licensing and released $ 8.9million as a result\nof its assessment that the likelihood of payment is now remote. The reversal of $ 8.9million is recorded within\ncost of revenue, player during the year ended December 31, 2018, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course\nof business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. The\nCompany is involved in litigation matters not listed herein. Although the results of these proceedings, claims, and\ninvestigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final outcome of any\nmatters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties.The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n13.

As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2020, management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation\nallowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's valuation allowance increased by $ million and $ million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively, primarily due to U.S. federal and state tax losses and credits incurred during the period.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $ million and $\nmillion are available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to\nexpire in for federal and certain state net operating losses have expired in . The federal net operating loss\ngenerated subsequent to 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely.\nFor U.K. and Denmark income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforward of $ million and $ million,\nrespectively, is available to reduce the future taxable income, if any. U.K. and Denmark net operating loss can be\ncarried forward indefinitely. The Company also has U.K. research and development tax credit carryforwards of $\nmillion. The credit can be carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ million and $\nmillion for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in and , respectively.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), contains provisions that may limit the net operating\nloss and credit carryforwards available for use in any given period upon the occurrence of certain events,\nincluding a statutorily defined significant change in ownership. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of\nthe Code. The Company has assessed whether any section 382 ownership change has occurred since its formation and\ndetermined that a section 382 ownership change occurred on December 18, 2009 and tax attributes generated by the\nCompany through the ownership change date are subject to the limitation.\nA section 382 study was completed for dataxu covering the period from inception beginning May 1, 2008 through\nacquisition date of November 8, 2019. Based on the study, the Company identified fourownership changes for Section\n382 purposes. As such, tax attributes generated by dataxu through the ownership change dates are subject to the\nlimitation.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 is $ million, of which $ million is composed\nof research and development credits and $ million is related international activities.\nAs of December 31,\n2020            2019\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              19,487       $  14,541\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                         9,959          10,378\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statue expiration                       (75  )          (88  )\nGross decrease for tax positions of                          (196  )       (5,344  )\nprior years\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              29,175       $  19,487\nof year\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $ million of accrued interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions.\n103\nChange in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would have an immaterial impact on its effective tax\nrate. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12\nmonths.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,\nthe Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes,\nstate income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of\nunrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n14. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company did not engage in any material related party transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020. There\nwere material amounts payable to or receivable from related parties as of December 31, 2020.\nIn prior years, the Company engaged in transactions with one of its strategic investors. With respect to this\ninvestor, the Company recorded revenue of $ million and $ million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. The Company had an accounts receivable balance of $ million as of December 31, 2019 related to\ntransactions with this investor. The Company incurred expenses of $ million and $ million with this investor for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had a payable of $ million to this investor\nas of December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, the Company had engaged in transactions with another company in which the Company’s Chief Executive\nOfficer holds a majority voting interest and is a member of such company’s board of directors, and another member\nof the Company’s Board of Directors is such company’s Chief Executive Officer. With respect to transactions with\nthis other company, the Company incurred expenses of $ million for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were\noutstanding amounts payable to this other company as of December 31, 2019. The Company did t consummate any\ntransactions with the other company for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n15. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2014, the Company established a defined contribution plan in the U.K. for its U.K.-based employees. The Company\ncontributed $ million, $ million and $ million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively.\n16. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding for the period. For purposes of the calculation of diluted net loss per share\noptions to purchase common stock, restricted stock units and unvested shares of common stock issued upon the early\nexercise of stock options and business acquisitions are considered common stock equivalents, but have been excluded\nfrom the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is antidilutive. Because the Company has\nreported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, diluted net loss per common share is the\nsame as the basic net loss per share for those years.\n104\nThe table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share as follows (in thousands, except per\nshare data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                                        2020             2019             2018\nNet loss attributable to common            $                   (17,507  )    $  (59,937  )    $   (8,857  )\nstockholders\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used in\ncomputing net loss per share, basic and                        123,978          115,218          104,618\ndiluted\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted      $                     (0.14  )    $    (0.52  )    $    (0.08  )\nThe potential common shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their\neffect would have been antidilutive for the periods presented are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020      2019      2018\nEquity awards to purchase common stock                        13,088    15,668    20,057\nUnvested shares of common stock issued\nupon early exercise of stock options and                           1        31        70\nbusiness acquisition\nTotal                                                         13,089    15,699    20,127\n17. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the\nmanagement approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented\nseparately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the\nmanner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating\nresources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level.\nThe Company is organized into reportable segments as follows:\nPlatform\nConsists of revenue generated from sale of digital advertising, content distribution services, subscription and\ntransaction revenue share including Premium Subscriptions, sale of branded buttons on remote controls and licensing\narrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer\nConsists of revenue generated from sale of streaming players, audio products and accessories through retailers and\ndistributors, as well as directly to customers through the Company’s website.\nThe Company does not allocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable\nsegments. Operating expenses are not managed at the segment level.\n105\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the financial measures, including segment\ngross profit, which are regularly reviewed by the CODM and provide insight into the individual segments and their\nability to contribute to Company’s operating results.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020       2019       2018\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                        13  %       *          *\nPlayer segment revenue\nCustomer A                                        10  %      16  %      15  %\nCustomer B                                        18  %      17  %      15  %\nCustomer C                                        40  %      39  %      38  %\nRevenue in international markets was less than % in each of the periods presented.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have\nconcluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nbelow.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\n107\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and\nincluded an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s change in method of accounting for leases in fiscal year\n2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 25, 2021\n108"

TV streaming is now mainstream and consumers are spending\nmore time watching TV streaming services, with many ‘cutting the cord’ from legacy TV services entirely. Over the\npast several years, nearly every major media company has entered TV streaming and launched a streaming service.\nSimilarly, advertisers looking to reach and engage with streaming audiences are increasingly taking advantage of\nthe benefits inherent to the digital advertising capabilities of TV streaming platforms and are re-allocating their\nbudgets accordingly.\nOur Strategy\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nconsumers, content publishers, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we are focused on connecting\nconsumers to the entertainment they love, enabling content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and\nproviding advertisers with unique capabilities to engage consumers. Central to our platform is the Roku operating\nsystem (the “Roku OS”). The Roku OS is purpose built for TV and designed to run on low-cost hardware which allows\nus to manufacture and sell streaming players that are affordable. The Roku OS also powers Roku TV models that are\nmanufactured and sold by our TV brand partners who license the Roku OS and leverage our smart TV hardware reference\ndesigns. Roku TV models and Roku streaming players enable consumers to access a wide selection of content by\nconnecting their Roku device to our streaming platform via a home broadband network.\nThe features and functionality of our platform, powered by the Roku OS, enable us to address the needs of our\nconsumers, content publishers, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners, and other partners. Consumers can discover and\naccess a wide variety of streaming content, content publishers can reach our highly-engaged user base of over 60\nmillion active accounts and utilize our billing services and data insight tools, advertisers can serve targeted and\nmeasurable ads to the TV viewers that they want to reach, Roku TV brand partners can build market share by offering\nhigh performance smart TVs in a range of sizes and price points, and retailers can offer customers Roku’s highly-\nrated streaming devices online and in stores. We continue to invest significant resources to advance the Roku OS;\nto provide an industry-leading platform for our consumers, content publishers, and advertisers; to obtain content\nfor our platform that attracts users, including our own original content; and to extend Roku’s advantage as the\nstreaming decade continues.\nOur Business Model\nThree core areas of focus define our business model. First, we build scale by increasing our active accounts.\nSecond, we increase engagement by growing the hours of content streamed through our platform. And third, we\nmonetize the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Furthermore, our business model is designed\nto fulfill the needs of the participants in the TV streaming ecosystem: consumers, content publishers, advertisers,\nTV brand partners, other device licensees, and retailers.\nScale: Increasing the number of active accounts\nWe make access to TV streaming affordable in part by offering a lineup of stand-alone streaming players that\nconnect to a user’s TV. To enhance our users’ experience and to provide a better audio experience, we also offer\nour Roku Streambars with a streaming player built in that enables the soundbar to connect to our streaming\nplatform, Roku wireless speakers that connect to Roku TV models and Roku Streambars, and our Roku Wireless\nSubwoofers. Furthermore, we offer customer choice with The Roku TV Ready program, which in partnership with audio\ncompanies, we enable their audio products to work seamlessly with Roku TV models. We launch new devices and provide\nupdates via the Roku OS periodically to ensure they offer the highest performance at an affordable price.\nWe also license the Roku OS to TV brand partners that manufacture and sell co-branded Roku TV models that integrate\nthe Roku OS to enable basic TV functions and connect to our TV streaming platform. We have driven strong active\naccount growth through our Roku TV licensing program. Using our reference designs results in relatively low\nhardware costs, enabling these TV brand licensees to manufacture and sell smart TVs that are competitively priced\nfor consumers and that are automatically updated whenever we issue a Roku OS update.\n5\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telecommunications service operators that distribute co-branded\nplayers to their subscribers in their markets.\nWe offer consumers tremendous optionality and value with respect to gaining access to the Roku platform that is\ncombined with an exceptional user experience on the platform. We have been able to significantly scale our active\naccount base over a multi-year period. In 2021, we added over 8.9 million active accounts, ending the year with\n60.1 million active accounts.\nEngagement: Growing streaming hours\nWe believe that offering users a wide range of content and easy-to-use user interface drives increased user\nengagement by delivering a better overall streaming experience. Streaming hours on our platform have grown from\n58.7 billion hours in 2020 to 73.2 billion hours in 2021, as our active accounts have grown through the\ndistribution of Roku streaming players and our partners’ Roku TV models.\nThrough our streaming platform and our streaming devices, we make it easy and affordable for our users to watch\ntheir favorite TV shows and movies, as well as listen to streaming audio. Furthermore, we believe our platform\noffers users an incredible streaming experience through a user interface that is easy to use and navigate. From the\nRoku home screen, our users can easily find and access the 500,000+ free and paid movies and TV episodes, as well\nas live TV, news, sports, hit movies, popular shows, and more, that are available from the thousands of channels on\nour streaming platform. And Roku’s powerful cross-channel search capabilities make it simple for our users to find\nthe entertainment they are looking for. Users have the optionality to align their spend to their budget by choosing\ncontent that is available on an ad-supported, subscription, or transactional basis. Our direct relationship with\nour users provides us with detailed insights about our users and their behavior on our platform, including certain\ncontent they search for, the channels they install, the channels they watch, and certain content that they purchase\nor subscribe to on our platform. Our first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content\nrecommendations to improve our users’ experience.\nWe enable our content partners to publish streaming channels, quickly and easily, which makes us an attractive\nplatform for content publishers to partner with as they seek to reach TV streaming, or over-the-top (“OTT”), users.\nContent publishers can deliver content directly to our large and relevant audiences and reach those users who no\nlonger use or those who never used legacy TV or paid TV subscriptions. As consumers shift to TV streaming, content\npublishers that use our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage users directly.\nThe Roku Channel is our own streaming channel that drives user engagement on our platform by providing our users\nfree, ad-supported access to a large library of third-party movies and shows on-demand that we directly license,\nlive streaming linear channels, original content, and subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) content made available\nthrough Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel. The Roku Channel offers Premium Subscriptions from dozens of\ncontent partners, giving users the ability to browse all available content before signing up, obtain free trials\nfor subscriptions, sign up in one-click, and enjoy simple subscription management with a single monthly bill. The\nRoku Channel also is intended to help content publishers drive additional viewership and maximize the value of\ntheir content on our platform. For example, we provide personalized content selection for users and integrated Roku\nPay billing services into The Roku Channel to enable one-click subscriptions. The Roku Channel is available in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In the United States, The Roku Channel features a diverse lineup of\nmore than 80,000 free movies and TV shows, including original and exclusive content, 200+ free live linear\ntelevision channels, free ad-supported entertainment for kids and family with more than 10,000 titles, and more\nthan 50 premium subscription channels.\nThe Roku Channel model offers content that grows engagement, which accelerates advertising revenue, which then\nenables more investment in content. To further drive user engagement on our platform, in 2021, we acquired\nexclusive movies and TV shows for the first time, featuring titles that are exclusive to The Roku Channel. In May\n2021, we launched this original exclusive content as Roku Originals, which is original content exclusive to The\nRoku Channel. Our first Roku Originals consisted of content from the Quibi library, which we acquired in January\n2021. We have since greenlit second seasons of some of these shows and added original content that was not part of\nthat acquisition. We also acquired the This Old House franchise in March 2021, and launched advertising-supported\nvideo on demand (“AVOD”), ad-supported linear, and Premium Subscription channels for This Old House content on The\nRoku Channel. In 2021, we also launched the Roku Brand Studio that evolves the advertising product and enhances the\nstreaming experience for our users. Through Roku Brand Studio, Roku helps marketers go beyond the traditional\n30-second TV ad spot and offer more innovative ad experiences, such as sponsored ads in our user interface,\ninteractive video ads, branded content series, and more. Roku Originals will continue to play an important part of\nThe Roku Channel’s programming in 2022 and beyond with content investments in original programming planned to be\ncommensurate with the channel’s overall growth.\n6\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe believe that running relevant display and digital ads enhances the user experience on our platform. We generate\nplatform segment revenue by monetizing our users’ engagement on our platform through a variety of services and\ncapabilities, including sales of subscription services and other commerce transactions, brand sponsorship and\npromotions, billing services, and video advertising in ad supported channels. Each user on our platform creates\nmultiple revenue opportunities for Roku, whether they are purchasing content, enjoying ad-supported content,\nopening the Roku home page and seeing a branded takeover of our home screen, or using a Roku remote. We measure\nmonetization of our platform by calculating the average revenue per user (“ARPU”), which we believe represents the\ninherent value of our business model, and growth in gross profit. In 2021, ARPU (which we measure on a trailing\ntwelve-month basis) increased from $28.76 as of December 31, 2020 to $41.03 as of December 31, 2021 and gross\nprofit for the full year grew from $808.2 million as of December 31, 2020 to $1,408.6 million as of December 31,\n2021.\nOur sophisticated and leading streaming platform enables advertisers, including content publishers, brands, and\nagencies, to reach audiences that are no longer reachable or are increasingly unavailable through advertising on\nlegacy TV. We make it easy for content publishers to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three\nprimary business models: transaction video on demand (“TVOD”) that includes channels that offer a la carte movie\npurchases or rentals, subscription video on demand that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand\nchannels and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution services, and ad-supported, which\nincludes AVOD channels with on demand content that do not charge a subscription fee to users, as well as free ad-\nsupported streaming TV (“FAST”), which we define as free, ad-supported linear streaming TV. Through Roku Pay, our\nplatform billing solution, we are also able to assist content partners with billing services, including billing\nusers for in-channel purchases like movie rentals, managing subscriptions, and customer invoices. We believe Roku\nPay is a key platform capability that simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for\nour content publishers.\nContent publishers also have access to our media and entertainment promotional spending campaign tools to help them\nattract and retain viewers. Content publishers can use a variety of ad placements, including native display ads on\nthe Roku home screen or a screen saver to drive channel downloads, promote a channel’s content, and direct traffic\nto their channels in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also derive revenue from the\nsale of branded channel buttons on streaming player and Roku TV remote controls that are intended to increase\nincremental usage of the channel by allowing users to launch straight into the channel from the home screen. Our\nanalytics and reporting assist content publishers with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles.\nUsing machine learning, we also can help content publishers target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe\nto their services.\nWe offer advertisers a unique and effective set of tools to engage with our users and our platform. Advertisers are\nable to leverage our direct relationship with our users, as well as our advertising capabilities and user data and\ninsights, to serve relevant, targeted advertisements. Roku’s first-party data is a result of our direct\nrelationship with users and is exclusively available in our Oneview ad platform. Advertisers on our platform also\ncan measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their return on investment. We offer engagement analytics\nsuch as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We work with a wide variety of\nthird-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and audience demographics,\nvalidate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform. Furthermore, we have\nrelationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data, which enables our\nadvertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on legacy TV. Additional\npromotional advertising opportunities include content sponsorships to give users the opportunity to experience a\nfree movie or show and sponsored themes on our home screen. We also sell branded content rows within The Roku\nChannel.\nOneView is the ad buying platform built for TV streaming. Advertisers use OneView to set up, make changes, and\nmeasure ad campaigns entirely on their own. In a world where all TV ads will be automated and streamed, our\nsoftware and machine learning provide the best way to reach a Roku user wherever they are -- Roku, other TV\nstreaming devices, desktop, mobile, and more. Advertisers choose OneView because it is the only ad buying platform\nwith Roku data, with ad space from The Roku Channel, and with new Roku ad experiences that go beyond the legacy TV\nspot.\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to improve the value for users, content publishers, and advertisers on our\nplatform. We must regularly update and enrich our platform to meet evolving consumer behavior and deliver a\nsuperior experience for our users, content publishers, and advertisers. Further, it is important that we remain a\nplatform for content delivery and invest to provide content publishers with best-in-class publishing tools and\nactionable audience insights. We must continue\n7\nto innovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental\nadvertising spend on our platform. Accordingly, we plan to continue investing in our business to enhance our\ncompetitive differentiation and seed future growth. In particular, these investments will include research and\ndevelopment initiatives to bring new features and technology to our platform; sales and marketing efforts to drive\nincreased scale and engagement of our user base; continuing to invest in both licensed and original content to\ndrive incremental usage of The Roku Channel; and building out our general and administrative infrastructure to\nsupport a global scale business.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe are expanding our total addressable market to direct-to-consumer and small/medium businesses (“SMBs”) that\ncurrently spend primarily on digital and social media platforms. We are building new advertiser products for SMBs\nto access the OneView ad platform. In 2021, we announced a new tool that will allow Shopify merchants to easily\nbuild, buy, and measure TV streaming advertising campaigns on the Roku platform. Also, in 2021, we acquired\nNielsen’s video automatic content recognition and dynamic ad insertion technologies. Roku can now enable TV\nprogrammers to replace legacy TV ads with targeted ads in real-time. This means marketers can improve the consumer\nexperience by no longer running the same ad too many times to the same linear TV viewer and content owners can\nincrease ad revenue by bringing Roku data and attribution into legacy TV advertising.\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional pay TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers consumers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to consumers, content\npublishers, advertisers, TV brand partners, other device licensees, and retailers is as compelling in international\nmarkets as it is in the United States. Today our products are available in 20+ countries while the Roku OS is\navailable in six countries. We are now the #1 TV streaming platform in the United States, Mexico, and Canada by\nhours streamed. We continue to build our foundation for international expansion by establishing teams and offices\naround the world and investing in systems and processes that will support international expansion going forward. In\n2021, we expanded into Germany with our player business and launched new Roku TV models in the United Kingdom,\nBrazil, Mexico, Chile, and Peru. In international territories, we will continue to focus on building scale first,\nincreasing customer engagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously drive active account growth,\nengagement, and monetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities\nare primarily focused on building and expanding relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands,\nretailers, and service operators, and driving sales of our streaming players and audio products and Roku TV models\nto consumers through retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships, to promote and build\nawareness of the features and advantages of the Roku platform among content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform\nto increase effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing\ncampaigns. We enter into distribution agreements with our content publishers and license their content through our\ndedicated content relationship management team. Our relationship with content publishers is typically client-\ndirect. We secure direct access to publishers’ video ad inventory as part of our distribution agreements and\nthrough access to programmatic ad exchanges in OneView to serve as an additional channel for content publishers to\nmonetize their audience. These sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content\npublishers. Whereas our publishers typically feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering\na large streaming audience across many channels at once using our own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of\nadvertisers helping them reach their goals across numerous key performance indicators. Our sales teams and products\nare organized into six groups that specialize in the unique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and\nFortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and mid-market clients, (iii) content publishers and entertainment\nbrands, (iv) performance and direct to consumer brands, (v) international markets, and (vi) local advertising.\nWe work with our Roku TV brand partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\ndevelopment, planning, manufacturing, and marketing. Similarly, we work with service operators on the planning and\ndevelopment of their co-branded players.\nIn the United States, the majority of our streaming players, audio products and Roku TV models are sold through\ntraditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, including their online sales\nplatforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website. We also sell products\ninternationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart collectively accounted for 69%\nof our player revenue for both\n8\nof the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and\nwork closely with these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting. We intend to\ncontinue to invest significant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and streaming player sales. Our\nrevenue and gross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our player sales through retailers in an effort to grow our active\naccounts, which typically reduce our player gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, audio\nproducts, TVs, features, and functionality. We work closely with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development process that\ncaptures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features\nand enhancements to the Roku platform.\nWe intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and\nenhance our platform and capabilities.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. All\nof our products are manufactured by our contract manufacturers in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asia,\nand Brazil. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific\nprice. Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish\nbased upon historical trends and analysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The\ncontract manufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in California, the United Kingdom, Germany,\nand Brazil where we ship our products directly to retailers, wholesale distributors and to end users.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our devices and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprivacy protections and the security of online services. And an increasing number of states have passed, or are\nconsidering legislation to govern consumer privacy. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate impose\ndifferent, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections, compared to the United States. Consumer\nprivacy laws are constantly changing and may become more diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the\nchallenges and costs associated with complying with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit\nthe ability of advertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet. To the extent regulators allow network operators to restrict the flow of\ncontent over the internet, such operators may seek to extract fees from us or our content publishers to deliver our\ntraffic or may otherwise engage in blocking, throttling, or other discriminatory practices with respect to our\ntraffic, which could adversely impact our business.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\n9\ncertain content quotas or local production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 750 issued patents and 600 pending applications in the United States\nand foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our product\nofferings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business, see Item\n1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on our ability to acquire users by delivering high quality streaming devices at competitive prices,\npartnering with Roku TV brands to bring co-branded smart TVs to market, and developing and monetizing our streaming\nplatform with compelling content, promotional services, and advertising.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with our streaming players and Roku TV models and\ncompanies that license their operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs and well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach consumers on other content and advertising mediums;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices that may be better able attract and retain top talent\nin engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\n10\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,000 full-time employees located in 13 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees currently are\nworking from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but we expect that most employees will adopt a hybrid work\nschedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home) in 2022.\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to use our\nbroad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions.\nAs we grow our business, our goal is to ensure that Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive. In 2021,\nwe launched our first company-wide employee engagement survey to better understand employee sentiment regarding our\nstrategy, culture, compensation and benefits, leadership, and other dimensions of the employee experience.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. We follow through on this commitment via our annual\npay equity analysis designed to ensure we pay fairly and equitably across gender and ethnicity, year over year;\nhiring and management trainings that incorporate topics on mitigating unconscious bias; and diverse interview\npanels that limit questions to those that are legally compliant and objectively tied to applicable job openings.\nOur Vice President of Global Talent Management and Inclusion leads a growing team that is focusing on priorities in\nfour key areas: Inclusive Employee Experiences, Inclusive Recruiting, Inclusive Communities & Social Impact, and\nInclusive Customer Advocacy.\nInclusive Employee Experiences : Our Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) Program currently supports six ERGs, which are\nvoluntary, employee-led groups intended to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace, build internal community,\nencourage career growth and networking, and support social impact partnerships. We also regularly hold educational\nemployee-led and expert-led dialogues that cover various diversity and inclusion topics, and we provide diversity\nand inclusion training and curriculum in the areas of bias, leading diverse teams, and sourcing diverse talent.\nInclusive Recruiting : Every member of our recruiting team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit\nqualified diverse candidates. In fact, all recruiters are equipped to discuss a diverse hiring strategy with every\nhiring manager to ensure we continue to widen the candidate pipeline for all roles. Our University Recruiting and\nIntern programs weave diversity and inclusion into their strategies so that we are recruiting not only from diverse\nschools but also diverse clubs and programs across all schools. Our external relationships also are focused on\norganizations that represent diverse communities, including technical and non-technical women and ethnic minority\norganizations, as well as professional Veteran’s networks, to enable our hiring managers and recruiters to attend\nor speak at diverse conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story to a wider audience.\nInclusive Communities & Social Impact : We have developed social impact programs to support employees and Roku in\nvolunteerism, charitable activities, and youth engagement.\nInclusive Customer Advocacy : As a TV streaming platform with both U.S. and international viewers, we believe our\ncustomer experiences should reflect the diversity of our customers. In 2021, we launched several “inclusion zones”\non the Roku platform that highlight and celebrate diverse stories from various content providers.\nLearning and Talent Development\nOur Learning and Talent Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to\nsupport our strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive New Hire\nOnboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources employees need to increase their speed to\nproductivity. In addition to mandatory training covering Anti-Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, and Privacy, we\noffer employees a highly encouraged suite of training offerings such as High-Performance Feedback, Effective\nMeetings, and Communication and Presentation Skills. Managers are provided with development on Expectations for\nManagers, Interviewing and Hiring, and Performance Management to support new and newly promoted leaders in managing\nand leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access to on-demand technical and non-technical skill\ndevelopment\n11\nthrough LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase, and custom-build additional training\nmaterials to support our global employees’ performance and development needs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation, we consider what they would be paid by another\nemployer, what we would have to pay to replace them if they leave Roku, and the amount we would pay to retain them.\nGenerally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of salary and equity awards rather than offering\nspecific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by different employees. We do not pay cash bonuses or\nhave performance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level regardless of\npossible bonus payouts or awards.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Investors and others should note that we\nannounce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (roku.com/investor),\nSEC filings, webcasts, press releases, and conference calls.

technology companies, content owners and\naggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to differentiate\nourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users\nand our business will be harmed.\nTV streaming is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and retaining\nusers on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need to be\nable to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to the\ncontent they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features\nand functionality of our streaming platform for users, content publishers, and advertisers. We also must\neffectively support popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime\nVideo, Disney+, Discovery+, HBO Max, Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly\nto actual and anticipated market trends in the TV streaming industry.\nLarge technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with our\nstreaming players. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart\nTVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into\nsmart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have greater financial resources than we do and can\nsubsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements in order to promote their other products\nand services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, and increase streaming\nhours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or\nthat provide a better streaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands\nthrough advertising than we do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast, offer TV\nstreaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing consumer\nbases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in the TV\nstreaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to our streaming players and our\npartners’ Roku TV models, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours,\nrevenue, gross profit or ARPU.\n14\nWe also compete for streaming hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may\nprefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming\ncould adversely impact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing\npressure, lower revenue, and gross profit or the failure of our players, Roku TV models, or our platform to gain or\nmaintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading TV streaming\nplatform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and support, and\ndevice distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards such as 8K and unknown future developments\nmay require further investments in the development of our players, Roku TV models, and our platform. We may not\nhave sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive position. In\naddition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases\nand significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which provide them\nwith advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they may be able to\nrespond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sales, and\ndistribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products better than we\ncan. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards and may\nbe able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our sales volume,\nrevenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer audio products, including Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers,\nand Roku wireless subwoofers. As a result, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio speakers and\nsoundbars, as well as makers of other TV peripheral devices. While sales of our audio products have not generated\nmaterial amounts of revenue, if these products do not operate as designed or do not enhance the Roku TV or other\nviewing experience as we intend, our users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may impact the\noverall demand for Roku TV models or our other products.\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of over-the-top (“OTT”) advertising and OTT advertising\nplatforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, including digital and social media platforms, as well as traditional media, such\nas radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content and\nother advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These competitors\nare often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may adversely\naffect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from advertising. If\nwe are unable to increase our revenue from advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s\ncapabilities to further optimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory, and\nexpanding our advertising sales team and programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be\nharmed. We may not be able to compete effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our\nability to grow our advertising revenue and would harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,\nsuch as linear TV, radio, and print, and to advertising through digital and social media platforms. The future\ngrowth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising and on advertisers increasing their spend on\nadvertising on our platform. Although legacy TV advertisers have shown growing interest in OTT advertising, we\ncannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to legacy TV\nadvertising, especially if our users no longer stream TV or significantly reduce the amount of TV they stream as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic coming to an end, as a result of the launch of new hybrid broadcast standards (such\nas ATSC 3.0), or for other reasons. In addition, if we are unable to compete with digital and social media\nplatforms to win business from advertisers and agencies who have traditionally advertised on these platforms, such\nas direct-to-consumer and small or medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be limited. If\nadvertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may\ndevelop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our\nbusiness.\nFinally, there is political pressure in some countries to limit OTT advertising or impose local content\nrequirements on OTT services. This pressure has been driven by owners of traditional broadcast television services\nand could pose a threat to our services.\n15\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising and content distribution services. As\nsuch, we are seeking to expand the number of active accounts and increase the number of hours that are streamed\nacross our platform in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user base grows and as\nwe increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively monetize our\nexpanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of streaming hours, however, does not correlate with\nplatform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed or every\nuser on our platform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a player or a Roku TV is\nstreaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a player is connected to a TV, and\nthe viewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular\nstreaming channel may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe\nthat this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes. Since the first\nquarter of 2020, all Roku devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when content has been\ncontinuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This feature, which we\nrefer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the\nselected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe that the\nimplementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our users, channel partners, and advertisers.\nSome of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have similar features within their channels. This\nRoku OS feature supplements these channel features. This feature has not had and is not expected to have a material\nimpact on our financial performance.\nOur ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or\nprevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect personal viewing\ndata or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to\ncollect data regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our\nlegal obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing\ndata from many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users. Other\nchannels available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on\nincreasing user engagement and time spent within their channels by allowing users to purchase additional content\nand streaming services within their channels, for which we may earn less revenue than activations on or through our\nplatform. If our users spend most of their time within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to\nplace advertisements or leverage user information, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in\nproviding more relevant advertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or\ngross profit. If we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising,\nwe will need our users to stream significantly more ad-supported content. Our efforts to monetize our streaming\nplatform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not continue to grow as we expect. This means of\nmonetization will require us to continue to attract advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as\ndeliver ad-supported content that appeals to users. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nIf we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView ad platform or if we are not\nsuccessful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.\nThrough our OneView ad platform, advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage\ntheir OTT, desktop and mobile advertising campaigns. OneView leverages the demand-side platform (“DSP”) developed\nby dataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of our\nproprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic OTT ad buying is an emerging market, and\nour current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not shift to programmatic ad buying from other\nbuying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for programmatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or\ndevelops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising agencies may not use OneView or we may not attract\nprospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and our business could be harmed. In addition, we have\nlimited experience running a DSP, and if OneView does not have the functionality or services expected by\nadvertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be able to attract their advertising spend to OneView, or our\nexisting customers may not maintain or increase their spend on OneView. Moreover, our ownership of OneView may\nnegatively impact the ability of OneView to purchase advertising on non-Roku platforms. If we fail to adapt to our\nrapidly changing industry or to our customers’ evolving needs, advertisers and advertising agencies will not adopt\nOneView, and our business may be harmed. We also may not be\n16\nable to compete effectively with more established DSPs or be able to adapt to changes or trends in programmatic OTT\nadvertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue and harm our business.\nOur growth will depend in part on our ability to develop and expand our relationships with TV brand partners in the\nUnited States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service operators.\nWe have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand partners and, to a\nlesser extent, service operators in both the United States and international markets. Our licensing arrangements\nare complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential partners include TV brands,\ncable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion\nof our Roku TV program both in the United States and international markets. Our licensing program for service\noperators has historically been primarily focused on international markets and has been decreasing in scale in\nrecent years, as we have shifted the focus of our international growth to the sale of Roku streaming players and\nexpanding our licensing program with TV brand partners.\nIn the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our TV brand partners has materially contributed to our active\naccount growth, to our streaming hours, and to our platform monetization efforts. This growth has primarily been in\nthe United States; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to certain international markets. We\nlicense the Roku OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand partners to manufacture co-branded smart\nTVs. We do not typically receive, nor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements,\nbut we expect to incur expenses in connection with these commercial agreements. The primary economic benefits that\nwe derive from these license arrangements have been and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily from growing\nour active accounts, increasing streaming hours, and generating advertising-related revenue on our platform. If\nthese arrangements do not continue to result in increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth\ndoes not in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of a relationship with a TV brand partner or service operator could harm our results of operations, damage\nour reputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from other partners and distribution channels, or\nincrease our marketing costs. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with\nany of these third parties, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, or other impediments to our\ndevelopment of these relationships, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nUnder these license arrangements, we generally have limited control over the amount and timing of resources these\nentities dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our TV brand partners have failed to meet their forecasts for\ndistributing licensed streaming devices, and they may fail to meet their forecasts in the future. If our TV brand\nor service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts for distributing licensed streaming devices or chose to\ndeploy competing streaming solutions within their product lines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed\non our platform. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the top three streaming services represented over 50% of all\nhours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically streamed a\nlarge percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, active accounts, or\nstreaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming channels and popular content. In order to remain competitive, we must\nconsistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels and content, particularly as we launch new players,\nintroduce new Roku TV models, or enter new markets, including international markets. If we are not successful in\nhelping our content publishers launch and maintain streaming channels that attract and retain a significant number\nof users on our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be\nharmed. Our ability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel offerings on a cost-\neffective basis largely depends on our ability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\n17\nIn addition, if service operators, including pay TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream certain\nchannels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of popular\nstreaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand their\naudiences on the Roku platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nMost of our agreements with content publishers are not long term and can be terminated by the content publishers\nunder certain circumstances. Any disruption in the renewal of such agreements may result in the removal of certain\nchannels from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates. Our agreements with content publishers generally have terms of one to three years and can be\nterminated before the end of the term by the content publisher under certain circumstances, such as if we\nmaterially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content\npublishers’ security or other platform certification requirements. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are\nrequired to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing content from these content publishers on our\nstreaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future may not be able, to reach a satisfactory\nagreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements have expired. If we are unable to renew\nsuch agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, we may be required to temporarily or permanently\nremove certain channels from our streaming platform.\nThe loss of such channels from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our business. More broadly,\nif we fail to maintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if\nthese content publishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may lose channel\npartners or users and our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell\nour available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to\nsell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure\ncontent that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient\nsupply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are\nalso dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may\nfail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on\nour streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform\nvaries greatly among channels. Accordingly, we do not have access to a significant portion of the video ad\ninventory on our platform. For certain channels, including YouTube’s ad-supported channel, we have no access to\nvideo ad inventory at this time, and we may not secure access in the future. The amount, quality, and cost of video\nad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow and maintain a sufficient supply of\nquality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our business may be harmed.\nIf our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected\nnot to participate in our integrated advertising framework or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage\nwithin their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language\nin order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels on our streaming platform. If we introduce\nnew features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a change may not comply with certain content\npublishers’ certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers may find other languages, such as\nHTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their channels on other platforms. If\nkey content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop channels for, do not\nvalue and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine\nthat our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their certification requirements, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform are not relevant or\nnot engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver\nrelevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our users. Existing and\nprospective\n18\nadvertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and media and entertainment promotional\nspending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem irrelevant,\nrepetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of our\nadvertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but we may not be\nsuccessful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and content publishers.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant or are overly intrusive and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using our platform, which\nwill harm our business.\nThe Roku Channel may not continue to attract a large number of users or generate significant revenue from\nadvertising.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers both ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films,\ntelevision series, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs\nand expenses in connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize\nprimarily through advertising. For example, in 2021, we acquired content rights, including rights to certain\nprojects in development, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and announced that The\nRoku Channel would become the home of such content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old\nHouse business, which own and produce the “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related\nbusiness lines, to further the growth strategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The\nagreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make\nspecific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these\nagreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new\nagreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the\nduration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable\nterms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku\nChannel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream (including, for example, the content that we acquired\nthrough the Quibi and This Old House transactions) is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers, usage\nof The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, following the Quibi and This Old House transactions and the launch of our advertising brand studio, we\nare producing content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited experience\nproducing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing to our\nusers and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with content\nproduction, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not\nrelevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available\ncontent, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not\ngenerate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition, we distribute The\nRoku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising through the\ndistribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,\nour business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our\nplatform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from\nvarious content publishers. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or\nsubscriptions for any reason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content\npublishers or by other means for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from\nwithin their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn\nfrom sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their\nspending on such in-channel transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business\nmay be harmed.\n19\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that are outside of our control,\nwhich makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nTV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth\nand profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming\nplatform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an\nentertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access\n(including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband content delivery, broadband\nservice providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content traveling on their networks, the\nquality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for users relative to other sources of content, as\nwell as the quality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms. Accordingly, the future\nevolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact our success, is dependent on many of the\nfactors that are outside of our control.\nWe and our Roku TV brand partners depend on our retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our players\nand Roku TV models, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we could\nexperience lower player or Roku TV model sales.\nTo continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand our retail sales channels. The majority of\nour players and our TV brand partners’ Roku TV models are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such\nas Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, including their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon. We\nalso sell players directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers such as\nCoppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, and MediaMarkt in Germany. As we have only recently expanded to certain\ninternational markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or relationships with global retailers as\ncompared to our domestic operations or our competitors in international markets. Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in\ntotal accounted for 69% of our player revenue for both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our retailers\nand distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-\nterm contracts with any of these retailers or distributors. If one or several retailers or distributors were to\ndiscontinue selling our players or our TV brand partners’ Roku TV models, choose not to prominently display those\ndevices in their stores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations\ndue to COVID-19 restrictions or other concerns, the volume of our streaming devices or our TV brand partners’ Roku\nTV models sold could decrease, which would harm our business. If any of our existing TV brand partners choose to\nwork exclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to other operating system\ndevelopers, this may impact our ability to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV brands and\nour ability to continue to grow active accounts. Traditional retailers have limited shelf and end cap space in\ntheir stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website product placement\nspace. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines, stronger\nbrand identity and greater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with\nretailers. In addition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices and smart\nTVs, is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or\npromote our devices on its website. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our devices, or increased\ncompetition for available shelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing expenditures to\nmaintain our product visibility or result in reduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In\nparticular, the availability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is\ncritical to our revenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our devices during these periods, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be\npositively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our\nplayers or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of Roku\nTV models and the quality of the content that our content publishers provide, may be out of our control, yet users\nmay nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness\nand market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and may\nhave greater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through traditional advertising, digital\nadvertising or website product placement. If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand, it may be\ndifficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace, therefore\nour ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from thousands of channels, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and watch,\nand they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to our streaming devices. While we have\npolicies\n20\nthat prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates third-party\nrights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content. Controversies related to\nthe content included on certain channels that we distribute have resulted in, and could in the future result in,\nnegative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers. This credit risk may\nvary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In addition, typically, we are\ncontractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated period of time, regardless\nof whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In addition, we typically experience\nslow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While we attempt to balance\npayment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not always successful. As a\nresult, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than our accounts receivables,\nrequiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or\nthrough our DSP. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In\nthe future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may increase over time.\nAny increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on time or at all,\nour business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we\ncould lose users and TV brand partners or other licensees, which would harm our business.\nOur users depend on our customer support organization to resolve any issues relating to our devices. A high level\nof support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our devices. We currently outsource the majority of\nour customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end users\nof our players and audio products. In addition, we train our TV brand partners and service operator licensees to\nprovide first-level customer support to users of Roku TV models and co-branded players. If we do not effectively\ntrain, update, and manage our third-party customer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if\nthat support organization does not succeed in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing\nsupport, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our devices to users and harm our reputation with potential\nnew users and our licensees.\nWe must successfully manage streaming device and other product introductions and transitions to remain competitive.\nWe must continually develop new and improved streaming devices and other products that meet changing consumer\ndemands. Moreover, the introduction of a new streaming device or other new product is a complex task, involving\nsignificant expenditures in research and development, promotion, and sales channel development. For example, in\nrecent years, we introduced Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers, and Roku wireless subwoofers, among other\nproducts. Whether users will broadly adopt new streaming devices or other new products is not certain. Our future\nsuccess will depend on our ability to develop new and competitively priced streaming devices and other new products\nand add new desirable content and features to our streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new streaming\ndevices and other new products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and we must secure production orders for\nthose products from our contract manufacturers. The development of new streaming devices and other new products is\na highly complex process, and while our research and development efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex\nproblems, we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. The successful development and introduction\nof new streaming devices and other new products depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;\n21\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments, which could impact the\npricing, timing and availability of such devices and depress consumer demand, limit the ability of our contract\nmanufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies, and lead to shortages;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing\nmishaps, and shipping delays; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not have manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract manufacturers, and\nour operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players and audio products. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among other issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from strikes, mechanical issues, quality\ncontrol issues, natural disasters, and public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new streaming devices or other products. For example, in 2021,\nglobal supply chain disruptions led to increased component costs and shipping costs for our products, which\nnegatively affected our player gross margin. We expect that global supply chain disruptions will continue in 2022,\nand our player gross margin may continue to be adversely affected.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our players and other products to our quality and performance standards and specifications.\nDelays, component shortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems could impair the retail\ndistribution of our players and other products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our\ncontract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our players or other\nproducts to our retailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers to perform some of the development work on our products. The contract\nmanufacturers may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete desired development. Delays in development work\nby contract manufacturers could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our players or other products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our\ncontract manufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs\nincrease because of inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import\nrestrictions, or if they decide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or\nterminated, and we would have to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract\nmanufacturers. Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a\nposition to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance\nstandards on a timely basis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers\nfor any reason could require us to reduce our supply of players or other products to our retailers and\ndistributors, which in turn would reduce our revenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would\nnegatively impact our player gross margin. In addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities are located in\nSoutheast Asia, the People’s Republic of China, and Brazil and may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade,\npublic health, social, and legal uncertainties that may harm or disrupt our relationships with these parties or\ntheir ability to perform. We believe that the international location of these facilities increases supply risk,\nincluding the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade restrictions on exports or imports.\n22\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our Roku TV brand partners encounter problems with\ntheir internal operations or contract manufacturers or suppliers.\nCertain of our Roku TV brand partners have internal manufacturing capabilities and others primarily rely upon\ncontract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that they sell to retailers. Regardless of whether their\nmanufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our Roku TV brand partners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable\nto capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in U.S. tariffs on imports of Roku TV models;\nfuture possible changes in U.S. regulations on exports of U.S. technologies; U.S. restrictions on dealings with\ncertain countries, parties, regions, or imported inputs; foreign tariffs on U.S. parts or components for Roku TV\nmodels that are assembled outside of the United States; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays. Their\ncontrol over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when components are in short supply,\nmay be limited. For those Roku TV brand partners with contract manufacturers or suppliers, the problems are\nexacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the Roku TV brand partner does not have direct\nvisibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and other manufacturing and supply\nproblems (whether due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the current high demand for consumer electronics and\ninformation technology products, or other reasons) could impair the retail distribution of their Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors at times have affected, and could\nadversely affect in the future, our active accounts and streaming hours. For example, in 2021, some of our Roku TV\nbrand partners faced supply chain and inventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales, which we\nbelieve affected our streaming hours and active account growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing issues affecting the quality or performance of our Roku TV brand partners’ Roku TV\nmodels could harm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements and manage our inventory with our contract\nmanufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and air freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nplayers or other products are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and\ncomponents many months in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may\npurchase excess components and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase\nexcess components or build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In\nthe past, we have agreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a\nresult of our decision to discontinue a certain model of player or the use of particular components. If we incur\ncosts to cover excess supply commitments, this would harm our business.\nConversely, if we underestimate our player or other product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have\ninadequate material or component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our players or other\nproducts, result in insufficient quantities available to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of\norders from retailers and distributors. In addition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases\nin demand that resulted in the need to ship players via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight,\nand adversely affected our player gross margin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year\nholidays). Throughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, shipping delays, and sustained high\ndemand for consumer electronics and information technology products created tight component supply conditions and\nlogistical delays for our products and key components, which adversely impacted our player gross margin. If we fail\nto accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur players and other products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able\nto deliver our products to our retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our players and other products. For example, each of our\nplayers may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi front-end module, each of\nwhich may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a second source. Although this\napproach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering development and\nqualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also creates supply\nchain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or material supply\nissues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other export or import\nrestrictions on parts or components for finished\n23\nproducts that are used in final assembly of their components (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages\nof key components. There is also the risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease\noperations, be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put\ncontract manufacturers on allocation because of the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, or become subject to\nU.S. or foreign sanctions or export control restrictions or penalties. Such suppliers also have experienced, and\nmay continue to experience, production, shipping, or logistical constraints arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch interruptions and delays have forced us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which have not\nalways been available, and have caused us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching\nfrom a sole-source supplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new\nchips and components, and may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S.\nFederal Communications Commission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and\nharm our business.\nOur players and Roku TV models must operate with various offerings, technologies, and systems from our content\npublishers that we do not control. If our streaming devices do not operate effectively with those offerings,\ntechnologies, and systems, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed for performance using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth\nwith our players and Roku TV models offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be\ninteroperable with all channels and other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers,\nincluding virtual multi-channel video programming distributors. We have no control over these offerings,\ntechnologies, and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if our players and Roku TV models do\nnot provide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are\nmade to those offerings that are not compatible with our players or Roku TV models, we may be unable to increase\nactive account growth and user engagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will\nbe harmed. We plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, and we have experienced that it takes time to\noptimize such products to function well with these offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our\nlargest content publishers have the right to test and certify our new products before we can publish their channels\non these devices. The certification processes can be time consuming and introduce third-party dependencies into our\nproduct release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new products on a timely basis or require us to make\nchanges in order to obtain certifications, our product release plans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able\nto offer certain products to all TV brand partners or we may not continue to offer certain channels. To continue to\ngrow our active accounts and user engagement, we will need to prioritize development of our streaming devices to\nwork better with new offerings, technologies, and systems. If we are unable to maintain consistent operability of\nour devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms, our business could be harmed. In addition, any\nfuture changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, such as virtual service\noperators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of our streaming\ndevices. We may not successfully develop streaming devices that operate effectively with these offerings,\ntechnologies, or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings,\ntechnologies, or systems, our business could be harmed.\nOur streaming devices are technically complex and may contain undetected hardware errors or software bugs, which\ncould manifest themselves in ways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur streaming devices and the products of our TV brand partners are technically complex and have contained and may\nin the future contain undetected software bugs or hardware errors. These bugs and errors can manifest themselves in\nany number of ways in our devices or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security\nvulnerabilities, data quality in logs or interpretation of data, malfunctions, or even permanently disabled\ndevices. Some errors in our devices may only be discovered after a device has been shipped and used by users and\nmay in some cases only be detected under certain circumstances or after extended use. We also update the Roku OS\nand our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance processes, we could introduce bugs in the\nprocess of any such update. The introduction of a serious software bug could result in devices becoming permanently\ndisabled. We offer a limited one-year warranty in the United States, although applicable law or our software\nupdates could cause us to be responsible for issues\n24\nwith devices after this period of time. Any defects discovered in our devices after commercial release could result\nin loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service\ncosts, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims\nfor product or information liability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In\naddition, our contracts with users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations,\nwhich may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s\nattention and adversely affect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance\ncoverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be\nharmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects over which we have\nno control and render our devices permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they can\ncause our products to fail and render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by which our\nusers connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network router. If\nthe Wi-Fi receiver in our player fails, then our player cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access point, and our\nplayer will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to recall and\nreplace these players at our sole cost and expense. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, our\nreputation in the market could be adversely affected, and our replacement of these players would harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to develop new\nstreaming players or platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize commercially available off-the-shelf technology in the development of our players and streaming\nplatform. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to our players and our streaming platform, we\nmay be required to license additional technologies from third parties. These third-party licenses may be\nunavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain necessary third-party\nlicenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies with lower quality or performance standards, or at a\ngreater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of our players, streaming platform, and our business.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in recent quarters, we\nmay not be able to maintain or grow our profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we have\nachieved profitability in recent quarters, we may not be able to maintain or grow our profitability. As of December\n31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $90.0 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the\nfuture as we continue to expand our operations and invest in growth and new areas. If our revenue and gross profit\ndo not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may not be able to maintain and grow our\nprofitability. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of reasons, including without\nlimitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating\nor legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may result in losses in future\nperiods.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-\nto-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;\nour ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and\nmonetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or\nother macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is\ncurrently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\n25\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or player sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels, or features;\nthe addition or loss of popular content or channels;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our players or our TV brand partners’ Roku TV models;\ndelays in delivery of our players or our partners’ Roku TV models, or disruptions in our or our TV brand\npartners’ supply or distribution chains, including any disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs, or\nother trade restrictions or disruptions; and\nan increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party\nintellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our player segment has lower gross margins\ncompared to our platform segment (which generates revenue from digital advertising sales and related services,\ncontent distribution services, and licensing arrangements). Gross margins on our players vary across models and can\nchange over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, player\nreturns, and other cost fluctuations. In addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as\noverall profitability, may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or sales channel\nmix, component cost increases, price competition, or the introduction of new streaming devices, including those\nthat have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future\nstrategically reduce our player gross margin in an effort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our\ngross profit. As a result, our player revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and,\nunless we are able to continue to increase our platform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be\nunable to grow gross profit and our business will be harmed. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our player gross\nmargin was negative due to rising component and shipping costs. Though we do not believe that the increased\ncomponent and shipping costs are permanent, they may continue to impact us in the near future and are expected to\ncause player gross margin to be negative until such conditions normalize. If a reduction in gross margin does not\nresult in an increase in our active accounts or an increase our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial\nresults may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant\ndemands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our players;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nsupport a larger number of TV brand partners and service operators;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our business\nwill be harmed.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our devices and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our devices and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our\n26\ncompetitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and have greater\nexperience managing a global organization.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and\nregulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade\n(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content\nrestrictions, and local content and advertising requirements, among others;\ncompliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws,\nU.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials\nand requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records and a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that\nconsumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional pay and over-the-air TV services and products,\nincluding those provided by incumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing our streaming devices and streaming platform, including delivering\nsupport and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain\ninternational markets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest or economic instability, whatever the cause, including\ndue to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the potential Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions, long-\nterm environmental risks, or climate change;\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World\nTrade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in\ncertain markets, decreased use of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell\nour products to supply such services to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for\nmaterials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit\nare traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total\nnet revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the\naverage selling prices of our player sales through retailers in an effort to grow our active accounts, which\ntypically reduce our player gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our device sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, disruptions in our supply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or\nair freight delays, or for any other reason,\n27\nwould cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, delays or disruptions at U.S.\nports of entry have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our or our distributors’ ability to timely\ndeliver players and Roku TV models to retailers during holiday seasons. A substantial portion of our expenses are\npersonnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and benefits) and facilities-related, none of\nwhich are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue shortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the\nnegative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in the short term, and our business would be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our devices and streaming platform, our culture, and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and workforce participation rates. Our employees,\nparticularly engineers and other product developers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to\nidentifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. Because we face significant\ncompetition to attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive\ncompensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, the recent move by\ncompanies to offer a remote or hybrid work environment may increase the competition for such employees from\nemployers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we also may need to increase our\nemployee compensation levels in response to competition. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional\nskilled employees necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\nmany of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, the equity ownership of many of our\nemployees could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners, and\nother licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex. To manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational\nand financial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, Roku TV brand partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in errors\nin our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could\n28\nbe material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits from an acquisition\nmay never materialize. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence\nof debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose\nus to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient\nfinancial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions. In addition, the process of\nintegrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and\nexpenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies involve areas of operation in\nwhich we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies in\ninternational markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across\ndifferent cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks\nassociated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without\nincurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address such risks\nsuccessfully, our business could be harmed.\nWe have outstanding debt, and our credit facility provides our lender with a first-priority lien against\nsubstantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may\nlimit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe entered into a credit agreement, dated February 9, 2019 (as amended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”)\namong us, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders and\nissuing banks from time to time party thereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and\ncollateral agent (the “Agent”), providing for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal\namount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan A\nfacility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement contains a number of\naffirmative and negative covenants, which may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability\nto respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions. The Credit Agreement also\ncontains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00,\ntested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on the basis of the prior period of our four consecutive fiscal\nquarters. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we granted the Agent a security interest in substantially all of our\nand our subsidiary guarantors’ assets. In November 2019, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100.0\nmillion from the Term Loan A Facility. We also had outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2021, totaling\n$38.0 million against the Revolving Credit Facility. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Term Loan A and\nRevolving Credit Facilities” elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. However, if we\nfail to comply with the covenants, make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo any other event\nof default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which would give it the\nright to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the Agent would have the\nright to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If the outstanding\ndebt under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient\nassets to repay it, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWhen we borrowed pursuant to the Term Loan A Facility, we chose a variable interest rate based on the one-month\nU.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate.\nIf we borrow pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, we are permitted to choose LIBOR as the benchmark for\nestablishing the applicable interest rate as well. LIBOR, which is calculated and published for various currencies\nand periods by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), is in the process of being phased out. The IBA has\nceased publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and intends to cease publication of\nall other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (including the one-month setting) after June 30, 2023. Accordingly, in the\nnear future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate. The current and any future reforms and\nother pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past,\nincluding during the transition period. Although our Credit Agreement will expire in February 2023 (before the\ncessation of the publication of the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR setting), the consequences of the LIBOR\ndevelopments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the value of our LIBOR-linked\nfinancial obligations, such as an increase in the cost of our Credit Agreement indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new devices and enhance our streaming\n29\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our streaming platform,\nthe Roku OS, and players, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features,\nplayers, hiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall\neconomic conditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain\nadequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be\nharmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,\nand other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card\ninformation, other user information, employee information, and other confidential information. It is critical that\nwe do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information. Our\nobligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-certifications, and other\ndocumentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information in\nour possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as part of an information\nsecurity program, and limits on the use or cross-border transfer of such personal information. These obligations\ncreate potential legal liability to regulators, our business partners, our users, and other relevant stakeholders\nand impact the attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential users.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information), and as a\nresult, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or could have access to our\ninformation technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential information. In addition,\nmany of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. As a\nresult, our information technology systems, including the functions of third parties that are involved in or have\naccess to those systems, are very large and complex. While all information technology operations are inherently\nvulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks, and exposures, the size,\ncomplexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the large amounts of\nsensitive or personal information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to unintentional or\nmalicious, internal, and external threats on our technology environment. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from\ninadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third\nparties. For example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in\nthose systems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have\nexperienced, and remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, and\nimproper employee access of confidential data. Malicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of\npersistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and\nindividuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise,\nincluding organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others.\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols and offer work-issued devices to employees, the actions of\nour employees while working from home may have a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we\nprocess, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from\nemployees’ combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that\nwe\n30\ndo not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network. These\nrisks have been heightened by the dramatic increase in the numbers of our employees who have been and are\ncontinuing to work from home as a result of government guidelines and internal policies adopted in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or\nintellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the\nnature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our\nsystems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,\ncontent publishers’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our\ndata (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or\nintellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or\nservices in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to\nprotect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the\nthreat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our\ncybersecurity. Recent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and\nransomware attacks, with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware\ntechniques and methodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may\nimpact our ability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors\nexperience an outage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally,\nour third-party vendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such\nthird parties for use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business\ncould be affected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open source software, which may be incorporated\ninto our systems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which\nwe are not aware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. For example, the Apache Log4j vulnerability\ndiscovered in December 2021 can be exploited by remote code execution, which can allow a bad actor to steal data or\ntake over our systems. We have taken steps to patch this vulnerability by updating our relevant Apache software,\nbut we, and the many other affected organizations, remain vulnerable in light of the widespread use of the Apache\nLog4i library and difficulty in identifying all instances of this library across an entire enterprise.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that our insurance policies may not cover some or all\naspects of a security incident. Insurance policies will also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a\nmajor security incident. Even where an incident is covered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the\ncosts of complete remediation and redress that we may be faced with in the wake of a security incident. The\nsuccessful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our platform, our streaming devices,\nwebsite, computer systems, or our mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us to liability, be\nexpensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our reputation. Efforts to prevent threat\nactors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in our devices are expensive to implement\nand may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or vulnerabilities. Such unauthorized access to our\ndata could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk of contractual damages,\nlitigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of harm to our business\ncaused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings and as we enter into\nnew markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial resources now and\nwill likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other\nsimilar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\nforeign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our\nproduct development and our business operations.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot\n31\ndiscovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to systems,\nand many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to\nunauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal information\nregarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal\nor state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming, distracting, and\nexpensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the\ncorrectness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations, and contractual\nobligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in\nincreased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm. For example, in\nthe wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties and related\nenforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment Card\nIndustry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data. Penalties\narising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities within\nthe payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our\nprivacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further\nsecurity incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer\nof sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims\nby third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents. Data protection laws around the world often require\n“reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation\nand application of those laws are often uncertain and evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security\nmeasures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security\nmeasures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be\nable to protect the information we maintain. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory\ncorrective action due to a data security incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result\nin substantial costs and reputational harm.\nWe and our service providers collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential information, which\ncreates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),\nemployees, and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect, process, transmit, and store\npersonal or confidential information of our users (including our users’ payment card data), employees, and\npartners. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad and may store\nor process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service providers and\nour business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related technologies,\nto help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and partners’ content to\ndeliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our partners on our devices.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully\nleverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be\nrestricted by a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our\nservice providers’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by\nadvertisers, content publishers, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws,\nregulations, and industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit\naccess to or storage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for\nadvertising) that is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of\na transmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection\nof information which is used for advertising purposes. Additionally, certain device manufacturers or operating\nsystem providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and similar technologies, or otherwise restrict the\ncollection of personal information through these or other tools, via our applications. Any restrictions on our\n32\nability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our revenue, particularly our platform revenue which\ndepends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising campaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and\nsecurity of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory\nenvironment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,\ncontent distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally. Privacy and\nconsumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state attorneys\ngeneral, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian national data\nprotection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that identify or are\nidentifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the internet, and we\nexpect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and foreign governments\nhave enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’\nability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and\nconsent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For example, the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage, and use of\npersonal information related to people located in the EU (or which is processed in the context of EU operations)\nand places new data protection obligations and restrictions on organizations, and may require us to make further\nchanges to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what we have already done. In addition, in the wake of\nthe United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted a framework similar to the\nGDPR. The EU has recently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being “adequate” to receive EU\npersonal data. We are monitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data protection framework and\nthe impact this may have on our business.\nWe made changes to our data protection compliance program to prepare for the GDPR and will continue to monitor the\nimplementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not compliant with GDPR or other data\nprotection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties (such\nas restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For example, under the GDPR,\nfines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, as well as data processing restrictions,\ncould be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Data protection laws continue to proliferate\nthroughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For example, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law\n(“LGPD”) came into effect in August 2020. The LGPD bears many substantive similarities to the GDPR such as extra-\nterritorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data transfer restrictions, and mandatory breach\nnotification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a company’s annual revenue in Brazil.\nThe U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based\ndata privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider\nadditional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an\neffort to comply. For example, effective October 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information\nLaw (“SPI Law”) to require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to\nintake requests from consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Effective January 2020, the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal\ninformation, such as rights to access, and require deletion of, their personal information, opt out of the sale of\ntheir personal information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA\nalso provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may\nincrease data breach litigation. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which becomes effective on January 1,\n2023 (with a “look-back” to January 1, 2022), builds on the CCPA and among other things, requires the establishment\nof a dedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy issues. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado adopted laws introducing\nnew privacy obligations for which we may need to take additional steps to comply. We are continuing to assess the\nimpact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments to existing laws on our\nbusiness. Such restrictions could, for example, limit our ability to supply targeted advertising and thus\nnegatively impact our business.\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.\nAdditionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a\nsecurity breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause\nour users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\n33\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United\nStates. However, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of data transfers to the United\nStates, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to\nthe United States. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be an\ninvalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues\nregarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. In 2021, the European Commission\npublished updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within\nprescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal information outside of the EEA. The United\nKingdom is expected to publish final versions of its own Model Clauses in 2022. Updating agreements to incorporate\nthese new Model Clauses for the EEA and United Kingdom may require significant time and resources to implement,\nincluding through adjusting our operations, conducting requisite data transfer assessments, and revising our\ncontracts. In addition, cloud service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny\nfrom EU regulators, which may lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal\ninformation outside the EU, which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate. We continue to assess\nthe available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data Protection Authorities and\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce on international data transfer compliance for companies, including guidance on\nspecific supplementary measures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data sharing that may be\ndeemed a cross-border transfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our ability to continue to\ntransfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to\nincreased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience operating\ndisruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter\nrequirements for certain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.\nMaintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect\nthat, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and\nenforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will\nlead to increased operational and compliance costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary,\nmake changes to our operations, policies, and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-\nrelated legal obligations, or any compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement\nactions, litigation, contractual indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or\nothers. In addition to potential liability, these events could harm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving\ncompliance if our employees, representatives, agents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our\npublished policies, certifications, and documentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international,\nlocal, state, and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual\npractices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing\nlaws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase\nour cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the performance and operation of the\nRoku OS, streaming platform, and computer systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our devices\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer\nsystems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-\nbased or cloud computing services. Although we\n34\ngenerally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we exercise no control over their operations,\nwhich makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that they may experience. In the future, we may\ntransition additional features of our services from our managed hosting systems to cloud computing services, which\nmay require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we are unable to manage such a transition\neffectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services, operational delays, or inefficiencies until the\ntransition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we\nmay not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels\nand cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to\noperational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes,\nwars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar\nevents could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely. As we do not maintain entirely\nredundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations, products, or services\nand could adversely affect our business. Any disruption in the services provided by these vendors could have\nadverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform\nperformance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to\naccommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated\nchanges in technology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their\ncontinued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over\nnetwork operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as\nany decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic.\nAny material disruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, and traffic “shaping” or throttling,\nthat could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense,\nor otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also offer consumers\nmultichannel video programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators\nhave an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of\nother companies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to\nprovide preferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our devices and\nstreaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow\n35\nand face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us will grow.\nPlaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and pending patent\napplications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent litigation or other\nproceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been or could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be better\nable to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their substantially greater financial\nresources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant management time and divert\nmanagement from our business. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or\nother proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing\ncould harm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or\nroyalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to\ngain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property\nlicenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the\nscope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us\nand our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual\nproperty; cease making, licensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties. For example, we have in the past elected\nto develop and implement specific design changes to address potential risks that certain products could otherwise\nbecome subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from patent infringement and other intellectual\nproperty claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In addition, any lawsuits regarding\nintellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time\nand attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology. However, we cannot be certain that\nwe have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who\nhad access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements will not be breached. Any\nparty with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach that agreement and disclose our\nproprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be\ndisclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop\nsubstantially equivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret\nand enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-\nconsuming, and could result in substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign\ncountries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we\ndevelop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our\ncompetitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a\ncompetitive advantage in our market, which could harm our business.\nWe have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is\nno guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained\nwill be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. U.S. patent laws,\nand the scope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change\nto “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the\ndetermination of inventorship may result\n36\nin inventors and companies having to file patent applications more frequently to preserve rights in their\ninventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to file more patent applications. Another\nchange to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any issued patent in the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an action in U.S. federal court. Any\ninvalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to protect the innovations contained\nwithin our devices and platform and could harm our business.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. In particular, our actions to monitor\nand enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit versions of our products or products\nbearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace, which could divert sales from us,\ntarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our devices and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open source software in our streaming platform. From time to time, companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source\nsoftware or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming\nownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Although\nwe have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open source software, these processes and\nprocedures may not be followed by all of our employees or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of\nmany open source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on the sale of our\ndevices or impose unanticipated obligations that require disclosure of trade secrets. In such event, we could be\nrequired to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost,\nto seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our devices, to re-engineer our devices, or to\ndiscontinue the sale of our devices in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all,\nany of which could harm our business.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract\nmanufacturers, and suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to\ninfringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were\nto lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary\nliabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and Roku TV brand partners often\ninvolve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there\nis a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to\nour technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually limited.\n37\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and continues to pose risks to our business, the nature and extent of\nwhich are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nOur business has been, and is expected to continue to be, impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting\neconomic consequences. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to take precautionary measures intended to help\nminimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including work from home policies, suspending certain business\ntravel, and limiting physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences. We may take further actions as\nrequired by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, TV brand\npartners, content publishers, advertisers, retail and distribution partners, contract manufacturers, services\nvendors, and supply chain. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed\nby the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a mixed impact on our business in 2021. When staying-at-home restrictions\nwere first issued in the first quarter of 2020, we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours and account\nactivations, which have both since moderated as restrictions have lifted and we believe consumers have increasingly\npursued out-of-home entertainment activities. Although we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift\nof advertising from legacy TV to streaming TV, certain advertisers with businesses affected by the current global\nsupply chain disruptions have reduced and may continue to reduce their spending on advertising. We also have\nencountered supply chain disruptions related to our players that have resulted in an increase in component prices\nand elevated air freight costs to replenish inventory and meet increased demand, and some of our TV brand partners\nhave faced inventory challenges that have negatively impacted their unit sales, which we believe has affected and\ncould continue to affect our streaming hours and active account growth. Additionally, at times during the pandemic\nsome of our retail partners have had to close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations,\nresulting in reduced sale of devices in these locations.\nWe continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and\nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our operational and\nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including the timing,\nextent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic; the emergence infectiousness, and severity of new variants; the\ndevelopment, availability, distribution, acceptance, use, and effectiveness of vaccines, vaccine boosters, and\ntreatments; the imposition of protective public safety measures; the resolution of global supply chain disruptions;\nand the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on\nour business may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services,\nour supply chain and sales and distribution channels, our ability to execute our strategic plans, and our\nprofitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many\nof the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt and impact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the potential\nRussian invasion of Ukraine), terrorist attack, medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other\nman-made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our business operations. Any of these business\ndisruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. In\nparticular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. In\naddition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and TV brand partners,\ncould be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and\nincreased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California, increasing\nintensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages.\nFurther, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole. If our streaming\nplatform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the operations of\nour contract manufacturers, suppliers, or TV brand partners as a result of a disaster or other catastrophic event\ncould delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or Roku TV models, which could impact our business. If we\nare unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a\ndisaster or other catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or\ncatastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\n38\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,\namong others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation\nand regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations\ngoverning issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of\nproviders of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the\ninternet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing\nregulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing our Roku TV reference design, we were\nrequired to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing, manufacturing,\nmarketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations regarding the\nmanufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and our TV brand partners may be unable to\nsell Roku TV models at all, which could harm our business and our ability to grow our user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer\nprotection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little harmonization between jurisdictions\nand limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and other government bodies that contain\nprovisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and other tracking technologies to\ncollect, use, and share user information. The CCPA also imposes requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nhas laws requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from\nusers for the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In\naddition, EU institutions continue to negotiate the draft of the proposed Digital Services Act, legislation\nintended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products, and services. If we or the third\nparties that we work with, such as contract payment processing services, content publishers, vendors, or\ndevelopers, violate or are alleged to violate applicable privacy or security laws, industry standards, our\ncontractual obligations, or our policies, such violations and alleged violations may also put our users’\ninformation at risk and could in turn harm our business and reputation and subject us to potential liability. Any\nof these consequences could cause our users, advertisers, or publishers to lose trust in us, which could harm our\nbusiness. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to liability and\nreputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npublishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).\nSome of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to\nactivities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties. In addition, the FTC\nhas initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which\nlimits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children under the age of 13.\nThe review could result in broadening the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information that are\nsubject to these regulations. Changes to the COPPA rules could limit the information that we or our content\npublishers and advertisers may collect and use and the content of advertisements in relation to certain channel\npartner content. The CCPA also imposes certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain information about\nminors can be collected. We and our content publishers and advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged\nviolation of these and other privacy, advertising, or similar laws.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. These and other trade disputes can disrupt supply chains and\nincrease the cost of our products and the components required to manufacture our products, as well as costs for our\nRoku TV brand partners. This\n39\ncould cause our products and those of our Roku TV brand partners to be more expensive for consumers, which could\nreduce the demand for or attractiveness of such products. Countries also could adopt other measures, such as\ncontrols on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our operations and\nsupply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of restrictions\ncould be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the adverse\nimpacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also could have\na negative impact on consumer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth. In\nparticular, given the general deterioration in U.S.-China relations and ongoing tensions on trade, security. and\nhuman rights, additional U.S. sanctions, tariffs. and export or import restrictions, as well as Chinese sanctions\nor retaliatory measures, remain a serious risk.\nWe cannot predict whether new international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing free trade agreements\nrenegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the Biden Administration with other U.S.\ntrading partners; or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry\nor our business or licensees. If any new legislation or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade\nagreements are renegotiated or terminated, or if tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be\ninefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes,\nand higher prices could depress consumer demand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business. Although we attempt to\nensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and sanctions laws, we\ncannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within our complete control,\nand our devices could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our retailers to third\npersons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. Any such potential violation could have\nnegative consequences, including government investigations or penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may\nbe harmed.\nFurther, there are many uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic, including scientific and health issues, the\npace of worldwide vaccinations, the unknown duration and extent of economic disruption, and the impact on the\neconomies of various countries in which we operate or in which our contract manufacturers and suppliers are\nlocated. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in further supply shortages of products for us or our TV\nbrand partners, delays in shipping and transportation services that negatively impact our ability or our TV brand\npartners’ ability to import, export, ship, or sell products to customers in U.S. and international markets, and our\nability to market and sell our streaming services internationally. Any limitations or delays on our or our TV brand\npartners’ ability to produce, import, export, ship, or sell our products would harm our business, and could\nnegatively impact our international sales.\nIn addition, the effects of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU have been and are expected to continue to be\nfar-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic\nconditions. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people\nbetween the United Kingdom and the EU, and some disruptions have already occurred. Brexit could also lead to legal\nuncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws\nto replace or replicate. Although the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on the EU-UK post-Brexit economic\nrelationship took effect on January 1, 2021, it is incomplete, and the full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given\nthese possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent\nto which our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is\nuncertain.\n40\nU.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade\nusers’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the\nprovision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Laws, regulations, or court\nrulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including decisions that undermine\nopen and neutrally administered internet access, or that disincentivize internet access network operators’\nwillingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their equipment, could decrease customer demand for our\nservice offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our\nbusiness model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations governing the provision of internet access service.\nSubstantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in 2015,\nthe FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content\npartners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules. More recently, the Biden Administration signed an\nexecutive order encouraging the FCC to readopt comprehensive open internet rules. The FCC therefore could consider\nadopting additional or modified rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for data and services. If network operators were to engage in restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, any of\nwhich could harm our business. Several states and foreign countries in which we operate also have adopted or are\nconsidering rules governing the provision of internet access.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or\napplications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”) and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the United States, and the E-Commerce Directive in\nEurope, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The DMCA, Section\n230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to uncertain\njudicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that limit the\napplicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content moderation on our\nplatform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit our ability to\ngenerate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform. While our platform policies\nprohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the copyright holder, and we maintain\nprocesses and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in certain instances our platform has\nbeen misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted content. If content owners or\ndistributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our ability to maintain or expand\nour business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock may be\nadversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby\n41\nmanagement on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are\nunable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is\nunable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The\nNasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and\nmanagement resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is difficult to\npredict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm\nour business.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our\nnoncompliance, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\n42\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, and\nproceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nway that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government\nentities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees, may require us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other\npenalties or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation,\nand require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31,\n2021, Mr. Wood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though\nhe only owns 12.0% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Wood owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Wood is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. This\nconcentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could\nresult in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated\ncontrol could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited\nvoting power relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our\nClass A common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content publishers;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our devices or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\n43\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or\npublic health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation or derivative litigation. For example, a stockholder has filed a derivative\nlawsuit, purportedly on our behalf, against certain members of our Board of Directors and management in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention\nfrom other business concerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,\nat the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent\nworkers may also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is\ndilutive to existing stockholders and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock. If securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our\nstock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If\none or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly,\ndemand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n44\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail\nto comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against\nus, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of\nDirectors, on committees of our Board of Directors, or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our outstanding Credit Agreement contains prohibitions\non the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A\ncommon stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Roku, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\n45\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business."

                "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and\n2019 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2020 filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nOverview\nWe operate in two reportable segments: the platform segment and the player segment. Platform revenue is generated\nfrom the sale of digital advertising and related services including our OneView ad platform, content distribution\nservices (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the\nsale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls), and licensing\narrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer revenue is generated primarily from the sale of streaming players and audio products. We expect to continue\nto manage the average selling prices (“ASP”) of our streaming players to increase our active accounts. We expect\nthat the trade off from player gross profit or loss to grow active accounts will result in increased platform\nrevenue and platform gross profit.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe widespread global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic continued through 2021. Governmental authorities have put\nin place various precautionary measures and promoted vaccination programs to slow down the spread of the virus. The\nimpact of the pandemic continues to vary by geography as well as over time as different variants of the virus\nsurface. The majority of our workforce continues to work from home to protect the health and safety of our\nemployees, and business travel continues to be curtailed. We evaluate and refine our return to office strategy by\ngeography as circumstances change. We expect that most employees will adopt a hybrid work schedule (consisting of\nboth in-person work and working from home) in 2022.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting precautionary measures, have caused, and are expected to continue to\ncause, economic uncertainty both in the United States and globally as well as significant volatility in, and\ndisruption to, financial markets and supply chains. Global supply chain disruptions have resulted in shipping\ndelays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices. In addition, some of our\nTV brand partners have faced inventory challenges that have negatively impacted their unit sales.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift of TV viewing away from legacy TV to streaming TV. During the year\nended December 31, 2021, we continued to see an increase in the number of active accounts , but the growth rate was\nslower than in the prior year . Active accounts increased to 60.1 million as of December 31, 2021, growing 17%\nyear-over-year. Streaming hours for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 73.2 billion, growing 25% year-\nover-year.\nWe have largely been able to maintain an inventory of our players, audio products, and accessories in stock at\nretailers and online stores throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, like many companies, we have been negatively\naffected by the constraints in the global supply chain, which have resulted in shortages of certain components,\nincreased component costs, shipping constraints, and increased shipping costs. Player unit sales were down in the\nsecond half of 2021, year-over-year, due to the demand spike in the second half of 2020 because of the COVID-19\npandemic. In 2021, we insulated our customers from the rising player-related costs and prioritized account\nacquisition growth, which strategically supports our Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) growth. The increasing\ncomponent costs put additional constraints on our player gross margin resulting in a gross loss in the player\nsegment for the year ended December 31, 2021. Though we do not believe that the cost constraints and supply chain\nissues are permanent, they may continue to impact us in the near future, and we expect player gross margin to be\nnegative until such conditions normalize.\n49\nOur platform segment continues to perform well, with platform revenue increasing to $2,284.9 million for the year\nended December 31, 2021, reflecting year-over-year growth of 80%. Our ARPU grew to $41.03, up 43% year-over-year.\nAlmost every major media company has reorganized around streaming and, as a result, our content distribution\nbusiness has benefited as our active accounts growth was accompanied by continued consumer demand for both ad-\nsupported and subscription services, and increased media and entertainment promotional spending by our content\npartners. We believe advertising budgets will continue to shift from legacy TV to streaming TV and that we will\nbenefit from this shift due to our advanced advertising capabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2021, however,\ncertain advertising verticals experienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted product availability\nand resulted in reduced advertising spend. While we have experienced an increase in TV streaming during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and our business generally has benefited, there can be no assurance that these patterns will\ncontinue into 2022.\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, active accounts, streaming hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nactive accounts as they stream content on our platform. Substantially all of our gross profit is generated from our\nplatform segment.\nOur gross profit was $1,408.6 million and $808.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, reflecting an increase of 74%.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nactive accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the number of unique individuals who\nactively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an account. For example, a single account\nmay be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account may be used on multiple streaming\ndevices.\nWe had 60.1 million and 51.2 million active accounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively reflecting an\nincrease of 17%.\nHours Streamed\nWe believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices\nstream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku platforms are\nnot included in this metric. We report streaming hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content publishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming\nhours does not correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis.\nMoreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku player or a Roku TV is streaming content,\nwhether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer\nturns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming\nchannel may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this\nalso occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, all of our devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when\ncontent has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This\nfeature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are\nstill watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe\nthat the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our customers, channel partners, and\nadvertisers. Some of our leading channel\n50\npartners, including Netflix, also have implemented similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature\nsupplements these channel features. This feature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our\nfuture financial performance.\nWe streamed 73.2 billion and 58.7 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively\nreflecting an increase of 25%.\nNote About Our Streaming Hours Adjustments\nTo calculate and report our streaming hours, we utilize data from event logs generated by the firmware running on\nthe Roku devices that are recorded in a central database. The event information (play, pause, stop, time counts,\netc.) is generated by the firmware running on the Roku streaming devices, and event data is transmitted to our\ncentral database at regular intervals when a device is connected to the internet. Pause time is not intended to be\nincluded in streaming hours.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020 we discovered that some pause time was inadvertently included in the streaming\nhours information recorded in our central database. Upon discovering these errors in the log data, we promptly\nreviewed and analyzed the issue utilizing our firmware, data engineering and core analytics teams. We concluded\nthat certain past Roku OS releases inadvertently caused the logging errors. The error rates varied over time and\nacross different types of devices and firmware versions. As a result, we reported higher streaming hours and\nstreaming hours growth rates for the affected periods than we would have if all pause time had been excluded from\nstreaming hours as we had intended. Neither these logging errors, nor the resulting adjustments that we made to our\nstreaming hours calculations, has had any impact on our financial results, and do not require us to revise any of\nour previously reported key operating metrics other than streaming hours.\nThe affected log data was for the periods from February 2016 to August 2020. After adjusting for logging errors, we\nestimate that our streaming hours were, on average, approximately 0.5% lower than previously reported for the\nperiod January 2017 through September 2018, and approximately 5.8% lower for the period October 2018 through March\n2020.\nBy the end of August 2020, we fully deployed a software update that addressed the root cause of the pause time\nlogging errors and prevented them from continuing.\nThe roll out of the “Are you still watching” feature had no impact on the adjustments we made to our streaming\nhours calculations. While our revenue from content publishers is not based on the hours streamed on their streaming\nchannels, and the number of streaming hours does not directly correlate to revenue earned from such content\npublishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis; we believe that the growth in the number of hours of content\nstreamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the growing user demand for TV streaming. After\nadjusting our streaming hours as discussed above, our estimated year-over-year streaming hour growth rates for\nfiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2019 versus fiscal year 2018, and the first quarter of 2020\nversus the first quarter of 2019 were 60.5%, 59.3%, and 46.8%, respectively. The estimated year-over-year streaming\nhour growth rate for the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019 was 65%.\nThe following table presents the estimated impacts on streaming hours (in billions) for periods from January 1,\n2017 through March 31, 2020 and streaming hours growth rates on a year-over-year (“YoY”) basis by quarter for\nperiods from January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and annually for fiscal year 2018 and 2019. Revised streaming\nhours for 2016 are not estimated and therefore revised 2017 YoY growth rates are not available.\n51\nQuarter    Published SHs    Revised SHs    SHs % Delta    Published YoY    Revised YoY\n2017 Q1    3.3B             3.2B           (0.5)%         63.4%            NA\n2017 Q2    3.5B             3.5B           (0.4)%         60.0%            NA\n2017 Q3    3.8B             3.8B           (0.4)%         57.8%            NA\n2017 Q4    4.3B             4.3B           (0.2)%         55.3%            NA\n2018 Q1    5.1B             5.1B           (0.5)%         56.0%            56.1%\n2018 Q2    5.5B             5.4B           (0.5)%         57.2%            57.0%\n2018 Q3    6.2B             6.1B           (0.7)%         62.7%            62.1%\n2018 Q4    7.3B             7.1B           (2.2)%         68.6%            65.2%\n2019 Q1    8.9B             8.4B           (5.4)%         74.1%            65.5%\n2019 Q2    9.4B             8.8B           (6.0)%         72.1%            62.6%\n2019 Q3    10.3B            9.6B           (6.5)%         67.6%            57.9%\n2019 Q4    11.7B            10.9B          (6.3)%         60.2%            53.7%\n2020 Q1    13.2B            12.3B          (7.0)%         49.3%            46.8%\nYear       Published SHs    Revised SHs    SHs % Delta    Published YoY    Revised YoY\n2017       14.8B            14.8B          (0.4)%         58.8%            NA\n2018       24.0B            23.7B          (1.1)%         61.7%            60.5%\n2019       40.3B            37.8B          (6.1)%         67.8%            59.3%\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $41.03 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $28.76 as of December 31, 2020.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from digital advertising sales and related services including our OneView ad platform,\ncontent distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue sharing arrangements, media and\nentertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands. Our ad inventory includes video\nad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku Channel, native display ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well\nas ad inventory we obtain through our content distribution agreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-\nsell video inventory that we purchase from content publishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party\ninventory on a revenue share basis. To date, we have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nPlayer Revenue\nWe generate player revenue primarily from the sale of streaming players through consumer retail distribution\nchannels, including major brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and Walmart, and online retailers, including\nAmazon. We generate most of our player revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily\nsell our players through wholesale distributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers. We currently distribute our\nplayers in various countries in North America, South America, and Europe.\nPlayer revenue also includes the sale of our audio products, including wireless speakers, smart soundbars and\nwireless subwoofers.\n52\nCost of Platform Revenue\nCost of platform revenue primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory and\namortization costs of content, both licensed and produced. Cost of platform revenue also includes other costs such\nas payment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the delivery of our services that primarily include\ncosts of third-party cloud services and salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our platform\noperations personnel, and amortization of acquired developed technology.\nCost of Player Revenue\nCost of player revenue is comprised mostly of manufacturing costs for streaming players and audio products payable\nto our third-party contract manufacturers and technology licenses or royalty fees. Cost of player revenue also\nincludes inbound and outbound freight, duty and logistics costs, third-party packaging, inventory reserves, and\nallocated overhead costs related to facilities and customer support, and salaries, benefits, and stock-based\ncompensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our development teams as well as outsourced development fees. In addition, research\nand development expenses include allocated facilities and overhead costs. We expect research and development\nexpenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and player\nproducts and services.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits,\ncommissions, and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing,\ncommunications, data science and analytics, business development, product management, and partner and customer\nsupport functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include marketing, retail and merchandising costs, and\nallocated facilities and overhead expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars\nin future periods as we focus on growing active accounts, platform and player revenue, and expanding our business\ninternationally.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\nfinance, legal, information technology, human resources, and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting, and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the expansion of\nour business and related infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on cash and\ncash equivalents, income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated with the delivery of services as\npart of a strategic commercial arrangement, i nter est expense that includes interest on our debt and amortization\nof deferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement, and transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nOur income tax (benefit) expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have a valuation allowance for U.S. and\nNetherlands deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. U.S. deferred tax assets include tax\ncredits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the\nforeseeable future.\n53\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021       2020       2019\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   83  %      71  %      66  %\nPlayer                                                     17  %      29  %      34  %\nTotal net revenue                                         100  %     100  %     100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   30  %      28  %      23  %\nPlayer                                                     19  %      27  %      33  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                      49  %      55  %      56  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                                                   53  %      43  %      43  %\nPlayer                                                     -2  %       2  %       1  %\nTotal gross profit                                         51  %      45  %      44  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                   17  %      20  %      24  %\nSales and marketing                                        16  %      17  %      16  %\nGeneral and administrative                                  9  %      10  %      10  %\nTotal operating expenses                                   42  %      47  %      50  %\nIncome (Loss) from Operations                               9  %      -2  %      -6  %\nOther Income (Expense), Net:\nInterest expense                                            —  %       —  %       —  %\nOther income (expense), net                                 —  %       —  %       1  %\nTotal other income (expense), net                           —  %       —  %       1  %\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes                           9  %      -2  %      -5  %\nIncome tax benefit                                          —  %       —  %       —  %\nNet Income (Loss)                                           9  %      -2  %      -5  %\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nNet Revenue\n(in thousands, except                   Years Ended December 31,\npercentages)                                                2021            2020        Change $    Change %\nPlatform                             $                 2,284,925    $  1,267,744    $  1,017,181          80  %\nPlayer                                                   479,659         510,644         -30,985          -6  %\nTotal net revenue                    $                 2,764,584    $  1,778,388    $    986,196          55  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $1,017.2 million, or 80%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to higher content distribution services, including higher\nrevenue from media and entertainment promotional spending and Premium Subscriptions, we well as higher advertising\nrevenue which includes revenue from our OneView ad platform.\n54\nPlayer\nPlayer revenue decreased by $31.0 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in both the volume of streaming players sold and average\nselling prices, offset by a slight increase in revenue from the sale of audio products and accessories. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, the volume of streaming players sold decreased by 4% and the average selling price of\nplayers decreased by 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the volume of players sold\nis due to the slowdown in growth in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2020 when the growth was aided by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the average selling price is due to higher\npromotions during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 where the volume\nwas aided by the COVID-19 pandemic and required fewer promotions.\nCost of Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of Revenue:                                             2021          2020       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                   823,924    $  503,177    $   320,747          64  %\nPlayer                                                    532,060       466,992         65,068          14  %\nTotal cost of revenue                 $                 1,355,984    $  970,169    $   385,815          40  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                              $                 1,461,001    $  764,567    $   696,434          91  %\nPlayer                                                    -52,401        43,652        -96,053        -220  %\nTotal gross profit                    $                 1,408,600    $  808,219    $   600,381          74  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of platform revenue increased by $320.7 million, or 64%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily driven by higher advertising inventory\ncosts, higher content amortization costs, Premium Subscription costs, and credit card processing fees totaling\n$303.1 million. Platform costs increased an additional $15.3 million due to increases in cloud services costs for\nsupporting the platform and higher personnel costs.\nGross profit for platform revenue increased by $696.4 million, or 91%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the overall growth in our platform revenue.\nPlayer\nThe cost of player revenue increased by $65.1 million, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher product costs of $35.6 million, an\nincrease in freight costs of $15.0 million, an increase in overhead costs such as cloud services, outsourced\nconsulting services, and personnel costs totaling to $9.4 million, higher royalty expenses of $5.7 million, and an\nincrease in inventory reserves of $2.8 million offset by a reduction in other manufacturing related costs of $3.3\nmillion.\nGross profit for player revenue decreased by $96.1 million, or 220%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a gross loss for fiscal year 2021. The increase in costs\nwas driven primarily by higher direct manufacturing costs for player products and accessories as a result of\ndisruptions in the global supply chain driving component prices higher, combined with reduced player revenue in\n2021 as compared to 2020. We believe that the cost increases and supply chain issues will continue in the near\nfuture, and we expect to incur negative gross margin in the player segment until such conditions normalize.\n55\nOperating Expenses\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2021          2020       Change $    Change %\nResearch and development              $                   461,602    $  355,784    $   105,818          30  %\nSales and marketing                                       455,601       299,457        156,144          52  %\nGeneral and administrative                                256,297       173,231         83,066          48  %\nTotal operating expenses              $                 1,173,500    $  828,472    $   345,028          42  %\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $105.8 million, or 30%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $84.3 million, as a result of increased engineering headcount and related stock-based compensation, and higher\nconsulting, professional services, and cloud services costs of $17.4 million.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $156.1 million, or 52%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $91.4 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation in sales and sales support,\nproduct management, marketing, and business analytics to support efforts to grow our business. Sales and marketing\nexpenses also include an increase of $44.7 million mainly due to increases in advertising expenses to promote the\nRoku brand, marketing, retail and merchandising costs, and general sales promotions, an increase of $9.5 million in\nprofessional services and consulting fees, and an increase in facilities costs of $8.3 million due to expansion of\noffice spaces.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $83.1 million, or 48%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $50.0 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation, an increase of $28.3 million\nrelated to higher legal expenses, consulting, and professional services fees, and a net increase of $4.8 million\nrelated to higher general overhead, business taxes, and similar costs offset by recoveries of credit losses.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2021         2020       Change $    Change %\nInterest expense                      $                    -2,980    $  -3,432    $       452         -13  %\nOther income (expense), net                                 4,467        5,233           -766         -15  %\nTotal other income (expense), net     $                     1,487    $   1,801    $      -314         -17  %\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net, decreased by $0.3 million, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses of $2.5\nmillion and lower interest income of $1.4 million from a decline in interest rates, which impacted our investment\nyields. This was offset by $3.1 million of other income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated\nwith the delivery of services for a strategic commercial arrangement and decreased interest expense of $0.5\nmillion.\n56\nIncome Tax Benefit\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2021       2020       Change $    Change %\nIncome tax benefit                    $                    -5,798    $  -945    $    -4,853         514  %\nIncome tax benefit\nIncome tax benefit increased by $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, driven primarily by stock-based compensation excess tax benefits, increased losses in a foreign\njurisdiction with no valuation allowance, and a tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,146.0 million. Less than 1% of our cash was held\noutside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign operations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and player revenue and proceeds from equity sales, including\nequity issued pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of revenue,\nincluding costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party manufacturing\ncosts, as well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting and professional service fees,\nand facility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment and mergers and\nacquisitions.\nAs our business and workforce continue to expand, we expect to continue to incur expenses for facility and building\nrelated costs for our office locations in the United States and internationally. In addition, we expect to continue\nour investments in purchases of computer systems and other property and equipment. We have pursued merger and\nacquisition activities, such as the acquisition of the Nielsen AVA business, the This Old House business, and\ncontent rights from Quibi, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition activities in the future, including\nthe acquisition of rights to programming and content assets. These activities can materially impact our liquidity\nand capital resources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance, cash flow from operations, and our undrawn available\nbalance under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and\nmaterial cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. Our future\ncapital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be affected by various\nrisks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this\nAnnual Report and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has not severely impacted our liquidity\nand capital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital\nand credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Our\nCredit Agreement expires in February 2023. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and also to restrictive covenants.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn March 2, 2021, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc., and Evercore Group L.L.C., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we could offer and sell from time-\nto-time shares of our Class A common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $1,000.0 million. In March 2021,\nwe sold approximately 2.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average selling price of $379.26 per share,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of $1,000.0 million and incurred issuance costs of $10.4 million.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (as amended on\nMay 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan\nA facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\n57\nFor our current borrowings, we have elected a Eurodollar borrowing with interest at a rate equal to the adjusted\none-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our secured leverage ratio. The borrowings under\nthe facility mature or have to be repaid in full by February 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are\nsecured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants, a financial covenant that is tested quarterly and requires us to\nmaintain a certain adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, and customary events of default. As of December\n31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 10 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $38.0 million and $30.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2021          2020\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   228,081    $  148,192\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                  -176,819    $  -81,324\nCash flows provided by financing           $                 1,003,147    $  509,048\nactivities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our net income of\n$242.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $355.7 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization of content assets, depreciation and amortization on property and\nequipment and intangible assets, and amortization of operating right-of-use assets. The changes in our operating\nassets and liabilities used cash of $370.0 million mainly from an increase in accounts receivable primarily driven\nby an increase in revenue, an increase in content assets, an increase in contract assets from revenue recognized\nfrom customers, payments made for operating lease liabilities, and a decrease in deferred revenue offset by inflows\nfrom an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventory balances. These changes\nare mainly due to overall growth in the business combined with the timing of receipts from customers and payments\nto vendors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included cash outflows of $176.8 million comprised of\n$136.8 million for the acquisition of businesses, mainly the Nielsen AVA business and This Old House, and $40.0\nmillion for purchases of property and equipment and expenditures on leasehold improvements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $1,003.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash was\nreceived mainly from proceeds from an at-the-market offering of $989.6 million, net of issuance costs, and proceeds\nfrom the exercise of employee stock options of $18.5 million. These inflows were offset by $5.0 million of\nrepayments made on borrowings.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 consisted of:\nPrincipal payments related to our Term Loan A Facility that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and\nthe related periodic interest payments. For additional information regarding the terms of the debt and interest\npayable, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to purchase finished goods from our contract manufacturers and other inventory related items.\nConsistent with industry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with\nour contract manufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\nopen orders based on projected demand information. Our contract manufacturers source components and build our\nproducts based on these demand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our\nproducts may result in us being committed to purchase excess inventory to satisfy\n58\nthese commitments. For additional information regarding manufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to license content from content publishers under contractual arrangements. For additional information\nregarding licensed content commitments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report.\nOperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and liabilities related to the\nlease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease liabilities, see\nNote 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.\nIn addition, we have $ 66.2million of unrecognized income tax benefits, for which we are unable to reasonably\npredict the timing of settlement of liabilities. These income tax benefits are not recognized in our consolidated\nbalance sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current\neconomic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing\nbasis.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations requires significant\njudgment.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation.\nFor performance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales.\nFor those performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that\nmay include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nTo the extent platform services are part of multiple element arrangements, revenue recognition of each performance\nobligation in the estimated transaction price of a contract is based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur player revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price. The\nestimates for returns and sales incentives are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We\nprovide unspecified upgrades and updates to our player end users. We record the allocated value of these as\ndeferred revenue and recognize it ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the\nassociated players. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at\nfair value on the date of acquisition. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\nthe useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\nintangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and\noutflows, expected technology life cycle, attrition\n59\nrates of customers, and discount rates. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected\nperiod over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances\nmay occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately\nvalue assets and liabilities acquired, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to\nconsideration transferred, and the assets and liabilities acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to\nthe extent we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets and liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe identify intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determine their fair value. The determination\ninvolves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an\nasset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate discount rate. We amortize purchased-intangible\nassets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We review purchased-intangible assets\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally\nestimated, or that the carrying amount of the asset group to which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts\nand circumstances indicate an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of\npurchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset group\nagainst their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over\nthe fair value of these asset groups. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we\naccelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nAccounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales returns\nand sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical experience,\npromotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and\nsales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual results, the\nlosses or gains could be material.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and\nliability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation\nallowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance to offset U.S. and Netherlands net deferred tax assets due to the\nuncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax\nassets. Our valuation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. and\nNetherlands net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. In order to assess the likelihood that we will\nrecover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income, we review the level of positive and\nnegative evidence of future taxable income which is a critical estimate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021 and those not yet adopted are\ndiscussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. They are\nincorporated herein by reference."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash, cash equivalents, and interest\nexpense on the Credit Facility. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while\nmaximizing\n60\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of\n100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. As of December 31,\n2021, borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility totaled $90.0 million with an effective interest rate of 2.0%. If\nthe amount outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility remains at this level for an entire year and interest rates\nincreased or decreased by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively,\nby an additional $0.9 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and we have minimal foreign currency risk related to our\nrevenue. In addition, most of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar, resulting in minimal\nforeign currency risks. In the future, if our international revenue increases or more of our expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely be more\nsignificant. For any of the periods presented, we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts. However, in\nthe future, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk.\n61"

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination of Content Distribution Services and Branded Channel\nButtons – Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content publishers, management is required\nto estimate variable consideration from transactional revenue sharing related to content distribution services and\nthe sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nVariable consideration related to content distribution services and sale of branded channel buttons on remote\ncontrols (“content publisher arrangements”) is included in the estimated transaction price based on the expected\nvalue for which a significant reversal of revenue is not expected to occur. For content distribution services, the\nestimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted\nperformance of the publisher’s content applications. For the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls,\nthe estimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and\nforecasted player sales volumes.\n63\nWe identified the revenue forecasts relating to content publisher arrangements as a critical audit matter due to\nthe significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration and transaction prices. Such estimates\nrequired a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to content distribution\nservices and sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\nObtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\nAnalyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for transactional revenue sharing.\nPerformed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for content distribution services and sales of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nTested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\nEvaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\nTested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\nWe considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to publishers’ content\napplications as well as our observations and inquires as to the changes within the business.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 18, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\n64\nROKU, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except

accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nROKU, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services\nincluding the OneView ad platform, content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue\nshares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\nchannel buttons on remote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands and player\nrevenue from the sale of streaming players and audio products.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior period amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and notes to consolidated financial statements have\nbeen reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\nthe impairment of intangible assets;\nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes foreign currency translation adjustments.\nComprehensive loss is equal to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. Comprehensive loss for the year\nended December 31, 2019 includes unrealized gains on the Company’s short-term investments and foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments. Income taxes on the unrealized gains are not material.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for most of its foreign subsidiaries. Monetary assets\nand liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at rates in effect\nat period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Revenue and expenses are\nremeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or losses from re-\nmeasurement and transaction gains or losses are recorded as Other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $ 1.2million, gain of $ 1.3million, and\nloss of $ 0.2million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n71\nFor those foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is designated as the functional currency, the Company\nrecords translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation\nadjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Twofinancial institutions managed 30% and 27% of cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2021 and 46% and 26% as of December 31, 2020.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consist of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nBeginning balance                    $                     5,912    $    6,550    $    7,335\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   16,181        14,594        15,541\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -16,078       -15,232       -16,326\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     6,015    $    5,912    $    6,550\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nBeginning balance                       $                    30,838    $   19,476    $   13,750\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                      90,530        68,315        65,676\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                        -72,957       -56,953       -59,950\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    48,411    $   30,838    $   19,476\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021         2020        2019\nBeginning balance                         $                     4,181    $   1,140    $    686\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2016-13                                   —        1,066           —\nAdjusted beginning balance                $                     4,181    $   2,206    $    686\nProvision for (recoveries of) doubtful                           -904        3,801         704\naccounts\nAdjustments for recovery and write-off                         -1,119       -1,826        -250\nEnding balance                            $                     2,158    $   4,181    $  1,140\nThe Company did not have any customer that accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net balance as\nof December 31, 2021. Customer H accounted for 11% of the accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31, 2020.\n72\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company determines whether a transaction meets the definition of a business combination before applying the\nacquisition method of accounting to that transaction. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase\nconsideration of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired businesses are\nincluded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations from their effective acquisition date. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and other related charges are recognized separately from the\nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is recognized\nat fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments\nto consideration transferred, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in\nconnection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and\nreevaluates these estimates and assumptions and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates with\na corresponding offset to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets acquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not\nlimited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In\nperforming its annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting\nunit’s goodwill for impairment or it can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s\nqualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is, more likely than not,\nless than its carrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s\ncarrying amount over its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes\nin business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be fully\nrecoverable or that the useful lives of the asset or asset group are no longer appropriate. The Company assesses\nthese asset or asset groups for impairment based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying\nvalue of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an\nimpairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill or intangible assets in any periods reported. The\nimpairments of operating right-of-use assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were not\nmaterial.\nContent Assets\nThe Company records content assets as Other non-current assets. The amortization expense for licensed content is\nrecorded based on the pattern of monetization of such content which is primarily straight-line. The amortization of\nproduced content is recorded over the applicable content life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenue\nto the estimated total revenue to be earned.\nLicensed and produced content assets are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less\n73\nthan the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether the film\ngroup is impaired. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets in any periods reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price of a contract based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales. For\nthose performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on market\nconditions and other observable inputs.\nWhen the Company sells third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the principal, and\nreports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, the Company\nconsiders if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as\nwell as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\nOneView ad platform, content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and\nentertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and sale of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies and to content\npublishers for their media and entertainment promotions via various campaign tools. Advertising arrangements\ninclude video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions. Advertising arrangements include\nmultiple performance obligations as they contain distinct advertising products or services. For such arrangements,\nthe Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company also\ngenerates revenue from customers using its ad platform. For such arrangements, it charges a platform fee, which is\na percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory spend during the month, along with data and any add-on features\npurchased through the platform. The Company recognizes revenue on either a gross or net basis for digital\nadvertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the principal in the revenue generation\nprocess or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to its customers\nfor the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Advertising arrangements comprised of\nmultiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of\nthe distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company’s content distribution revenue sharing arrangements include cash or non-cash consideration. The revenue\nsharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the\ntime of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is deemed to be the agent\nbetween content publishers and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, as the services\nare delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the form of advertising\ninventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party data.\n74\nThe Company sells monthly subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded channel buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to\na publisher’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to TV brands and service operators. The licensing\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time, when the Company makes the intellectual property available and the\ncontrol transfers to the customer. The revenue allocated to unspecified upgrades and updates is recognized on a\ntime elapsed basis, by day, over the service period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are\nprovided or accepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nPlayer segment:\nThe Company sells the majority of its streaming players and audio products to retail distribution channels in the\nU.S. including brick and mortar and online retailers, as well as through the Company’s website. Player revenue\nprimarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and updates on a when and if-available\nbasis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance obligation and revenue is recognized at\na point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified upgrades and updates are available to\ncustomers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated value of the unspecified upgrades and\nupdates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as player revenue ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated\neconomic life of the associated players products.\nThe Company’s player revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in Player revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\nplayer.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The\nCompany takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental\nborrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term,\nwhen it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options. The Company combines lease and non-lease components\ninto a single lease component for its real estate and equipment leases.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions.\n75\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between eighteen monthsand five years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from fiveto ten years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the\nCompany capitalized internal-use software development costs of $ 0.5million, $ 2.2million, and $ 0.1million,\nrespectively. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the\nasset, which is generally twoto three years, beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company amortized expenses of $ 1.0million, $ 0.5million, and $\n1.6million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of player revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, licensing and services fees received from service operators\nand TV brands, and advance payments from advertisers and content publishers where performance obligations are not\nyet fulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as a current liability and\nthe remaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company incurred advertising costs of $ 35.2million, $ 7.1million, and $ 7.3million\nfor the years December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted, in absence of its own\nhistorical exercise data.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatilities of several peer\ncompanies which are similar in size and operational and economic activities.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of our stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using\n76\nenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation\nallowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than\nnot to be realized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income\nTaxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes\nby removing certain exceptions to the general principles and also simplifies areas such as franchise taxes, step-up\nin tax basis of goodwill, separate entity financial statements, and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or\nrate changes. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic\n848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This guidance provides optional\nexpedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other\ntransactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) that is expected to be discontinued,\nsubject to meeting certain criteria. The guidance is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The\nCompany made a policy election in the second quarter of 2020 to elect a different reference rate for the Credit\nAgreement (as defined below) when LIBOR is discontinued.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , using the modified retrospective adoption method and\nrecorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit of approximately $\n1.1million. The measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and subsequent changes in the\nallowance for credit losses are recorded in the statements of operations. This impact mainly relates to credit\nlosses recognized on the Company’s doubtful accounts. As the Company did not have any available-for-sale debt\nsecurities as of the adoption date, there was no additional impact to accumulated deficit.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2019-02, Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film Costs\n(Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment—Broadcasters—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350): Improvements to\nAccounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials , in order to align the accounting for\nproduction costs of an episodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the\ncontent distinction for capitalization. ASU 2019-02 required that an entity reassess estimates of the use of a film\nin a film group and account for any changes prospectively. In addition, ASU 2019-02 required that an entity test\nfilms and license agreements for program material for impairment at a film group level when the film or license\nagreements are predominantly monetized with other films and license agreements. There was no material impact to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , to require companies to apply Accounting Standards\nCodification, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) to recognize and measure contract assets and\ncontract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years,\nwith early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The\nCompany believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the financial statements.\n77\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue is represented by the tworeportable segments discussed in Note 17.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             752,393    $  523,852    $  332,673\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                    46,952         7,431         3,588\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                       45,760        55,465        39,861\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   28,726        21,283        15,370\nTotal deferred revenue                   $              74,486    $   76,748    $   55,231\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for sales returns, sales incentives,\nand doubtful accounts. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets increased by $ 39.5million during the year\nended December 31, 2021 and by $ 3.8million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in\nthe growth of platform revenue combined with the timing of billing which falls into a subsequent period.\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $ 2.3million during the year ended December 31, 2021\nprimarily due to the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to content arrangements offset by an\nincrease in deferred revenue from advertising arrangements due to growth in the platform business and an increase\nin the deferral period of player revenue for its unspecified upgrades. Deferred revenue increased by approximately\n$ 21.5million during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the increase in estimated values of content publisher\nand licensing partner arrangements and change in the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations of\napproximately $ 12.4million, and higher growth in the player segment, resulting in a net increase in deferred\nrevenue related to unspecified upgrades and updates of approximately $ 8.4million.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2020 was $ 56.2million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $ 42.9million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Estimated contracted revenue was $ 1,148.3million as of December 31, 2021 of which the Company\nexpects to recognize approximately 43% over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nThe Company recognized $ 28.6million and $ 14.4million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in the\nestimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nThe Company did not have any customer that accounted for more than 10% of its total net revenue as of December 31,\n2021. Customer C accounted for 12% and 14% of the total net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\n4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nNielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising Business\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “ASPA”) to purchase the\nAdvanced Video Advertising (“AVA”) business from Nielsen Holdings PLC (“Nielsen”). The AVA business consists\nprimarily of video automatic content recognition and dynamic ad insertion technologies. On April 15, 2021, the\nCompany closed the transaction, acquiring from Nielsen the AVA business, consisting of certain assets and\nliabilities and all of the\n78\nequity interests in a subsidiary associated with the AVA business (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the\nAcquisition, the Company and Nielsen entered into a strategic commercial arrangement under which the parties will\nprovide certain advertising measurement solutions to each other. The Company acquired Nielsen’s AVA business to\naccelerate its launch of an end-to-end linear ad replacement solution and to further integrate Nielsen’s ad and\ncontent measurement products into the Company’s ad platform.\nThe total purchase consideration for Nielsen’s AVA business was $ 53.4million, which consisted of (i) $ 38.5million\npaid in cash and (ii) $ 21.4million of non-cash consideration related to obligations to deliver services to\nNielsen, offset by (iii) $ 6.5million of services to be received from Nielsen. The obligations to deliver services\nto Nielsen were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. The services to be delivered to\nNielsen are recognized within Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period. The services to be received from Nielsen represent contract terms that the Company entered into\nfor future goods and services that were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. These\nservices are recognized as Cost of revenue, platform in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period.\nIn addition, there are earn-out conditions in the ASPA which may trigger an additional payment to Nielsen. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, no contingent consideration conditions have been triggered. The Company incurred $ 3.9million in\nacquisition-related expenses and has recorded them in General and administrative expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company obtained additional information regarding facts and circumstances in\nexistence as of the acquisition date. As a result, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment in the\nfourth quarter of 2021 consisting of a $ 6.0million increase to purchase consideration, $ 4.2million decrease to\nintangible assets acquired, $ 4.5million increase to other long-term liabilities, and $ 14.7million increase to\ngoodwill.\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nreflecting measurement period adjustments through December 31, 2021, is based on estimated fair values and is as\nfollows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired                                        Fair Values\nCash and cash equivalents                           $        3,057\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                       85\nProperty and equipment, net                                    584\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped technology                                        11,000\nIPR&D technology                                             7,500\nGoodwill                                                    36,790\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                          1,235\nOther non-current assets                                     1,905\nTotal assets acquired                                       62,156\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities                    -1,168\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current portion              -830\nOther long-term liabilities                                 -6,767\nTotal liabilities assumed                                   -8,765\nTotal purchase consideration                        $       53,391\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is\nrecorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in advertising offerings and cross-\nselling opportunities. The majority of the goodwill recorded is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the developed technology has been estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. The key\nvaluation assumptions include the Company’s estimates of expected future earnings and royalty rate. The Company\namortizes the fair value of the developed technology on a straight-line basis over its useful life. The fair value\nof the in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) technology has been estimated using the multi-period-excess-\nearnings\n79\nmethod. The key valuation assumptions include the Company’s estimates of expected future revenue and margin. Once\nthe project reaches technological feasibility, the Company will amortize the fair value of the IPR&D technology on\na straight-line basis over its useful life.\nThe valuation of the intangible assets acquired from Nielsen’s AVA business along with their estimated useful\nlives, is as follows (in thousands, except years):\nEstimated Weighted-Average Useful Lives\nEstimated Fair Value    (in years)\nDeveloped technology                $                11,000                                             5.9\nIPR&D technology                                      7,500\nEstimated fair value of acquired    $                18,500                                             5.9\nintangible assets\nThe operations of Nielsen’s AVA business are included in the Company’s operating results beginning on the date of\nacquisition. The revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit recorded by the Company in its consolidated statements\nof operations from the acquisition date to December 31, 2021 are not material.\nThis Old House\nOn March 19, 2021, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of TOH Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“This Old\nHouse”), a home improvement media business, according to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company acquired the This Old House business because the Company believes the content aligns with The Roku\nChannel’s ad-supported growth strategy.\nThe total purchase consideration for This Old House was $ 97.8million, paid entirely in cash. The Company incurred\n$ 2.4million in acquisition-related expenses that are recorded in General and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n80\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nreflecting measurement period adjustments through December 31, 2021, is based on estimated fair values and is as\nfollows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired                                        Fair Values\nCash and cash equivalents                           $            7\nAccounts receivable                                          5,830\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                    7,310\nProperty and equipment, net                                    307\nIntangible assets:\nTradename                                                   20,000\nCustomer relationships                                         700\nGoodwill                                                    46,671\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                          5,498\nOther non-current assets                                    23,487\nTotal assets acquired                                      109,810\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities                    -2,747\nDeferred revenue, current portion                           -4,146\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current portion            -4,262\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                         -816\nOther long-term liabilities                                    -28\nTotal liabilities assumed                                  -11,999\nTotal purchase consideration                        $       97,811\nOther non-current assets include $ 22.5million of content assets acquired. The fair value of the content assets has\nbeen estimated using the income approach. Amortization expense related to the content assets is recorded on an\naccelerated basis according to the pattern of monetization.\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in the advertising\nofferings as the Company brings more free ad-supported content to the users. The goodwill recorded is deductible\nfor tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the tradename has been estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. The key valuation\nassumptions include the Company’s estimates of expected future revenue and royalty rate.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used\nto measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents including restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $\n1,015.9million and $ 71.8million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, using Level 1\ninputs.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n85\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe Company did not have any Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\n9. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate.

As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2021, management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a\nfull valuation allowance against its U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 261.8million and $ 169.7million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to U.S. federal and state tax losses and\ncredits incurred during the period.\nThe change in the valuation allowance, during the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in domestic net operating loss carryforwards, primarily due to stock-based compensation expense, and an\nincrease of approximately $ 46.2million in deferred tax assets that are not realizable, related to the IP transfer\ncompleted during 2021, giving rise to foreign amortizable assets.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2,169.9million and $ 1,824.3million are available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 for federal and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2021.\nThe federal net operating loss generated subsequent to 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely.\nFor Brazil, Denmark, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.8million, $ 2.8million, $ 6.1million, and $ 33.9million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable\nincome, if any, in those countries. Brazil, Denmark, and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward\nindefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be carried back one year and carried forward indefinitely. The\nCompany also has U.K. research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 0.5million, which can be carried\nforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 133.8million and $\n97.4million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and 2035, respectively.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), contains provisions that may limit the net operating\nloss and credit carryforwards available for use in any given period upon the occurrence of certain events,\nincluding a statutorily defined significant change in ownership. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of\nthe Code. The Company completed a recent study to assess whether any section 382 ownership change has occurred\nsince the Company’s\n94\nformation. Based on the study, the Company had a section 382 ownership change on December 18, 2009 and tax\nattributes generated by the Company through the ownership change date are subject to the limitation.\nA section 382 study was completed for dataxu, which the Company acquired in November 2019, covering the period from\ninception beginning May 1, 2008 through the acquisition date of November 8, 2019. Based on the study, the Company\nidentified fourownership changes for section 382 purposes. As such, tax attributes generated by dataxu through the\nownership change dates are subject to the limitation.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 is $ 66.2million, of which $ 48.7million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 17.5million is related to international activities. A\nreconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2021         2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              29,175    $  19,487\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        36,198        9,959\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                     -330          -75\nGross increase (decrease) for tax                           1,107         -196\npositions of prior years\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              66,150    $  29,175\nof year\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.4million of accrued interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions.\nChange in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would have an immaterial impact on its effective tax\nrate. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12\nmonths.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company\nis currently under examination by the Texas Comptroller for calendar tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. All tax years\nremain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits include questioning the timing and\namount of deductions; the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; and compliance with federal, state, and\nlocal tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,\nthe Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes,\nstate income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of\nunrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n14. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company did not engage in any material related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company engaged in transactions with one of its strategic investors. With\nrespect to this investor, the Company recorded revenue of $ 8.5million and expenses of $ 1.3million for the year\nended December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not consider this\ninvestor to be a related party, as this investor did not meet the defined criteria.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had engaged in transactions with another company in which the\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer held a majority voting interest and was a member of such company’s board of\ndirectors at that time, and another member of the Company’s Board of Directors is presently such company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer. With respect to transactions with this company, the Company incurred expenses of $ 1.2million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019.\n15. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain\n95\nlimitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nNocontributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nIn 2014, the Company established a defined contribution plan in the U.K. for its U.K.-based employees. The Company\ncontributed $ 1.3million, $ 0.7million, and $ 0.5million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020,\nand 2019, respectively.\n16. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to\ncalculate net income (loss) per share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and\nas otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by\napplicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic\nand diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, options to purchase common stock,\nrestricted stock units, and unvested shares of common stock issued upon the early exercise of stock options are\nconsidered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the treasury stock\nmethod. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share in the period of net\nloss, as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as follows (in\nthousands, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                          2021                   2020                   2019\nNet income (loss)            $                   242,385             $  -17,507             $  -59,937\nDenominator:\nBasic net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    132,710                123,978                115,218\noutstanding — basic\nNet income (loss) per        $                      1.83             $    -0.14             $    -0.52\nshare — basic\nDiluted net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    132,710                123,978                115,218\noutstanding — basic\nEffect of potentially\ndilutive\nsecurities:\nRestricted stock units                                      2,744                      —                      —\nStock options                                               6,214                      —                      —\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    141,668                123,978                115,218\noutstanding — diluted\nNet income (loss) per        $                      1.71             $    -0.14             $    -0.52\nshare — diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because of their\nanti-dilutive effect are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021           2020            2019\nEquity awards to purchase common stock                                1,128          13,088          15,668\nUnvested shares of common stock issued\nupon early exercise of stock options and                                  —               1              31\nbusiness acquisition\nTotal                                                                 1,128          13,089          15,699\n96\n17. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the\nmanagement approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented\nseparately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the\nmanner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating\nresources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does not\nallocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nThe Company is organized into tworeportable segments as follows:\nPlatform\nConsists of revenue generated from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the demand-side\nplatform, content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and\nentertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer\nConsists of revenue generated from sale of streaming players, audio products and accessories through retailers and\ndistributors, as well as directly to customers through the Company’s website.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021       2020       2019\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                        10  %      13  %          *\nPlayer segment revenue\nCustomer A                                            *      10  %      16  %\nCustomer B                                        23  %      18  %      17  %\nCustomer C                                        37  %      40  %      39  %\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Annual\nReport. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as\nof the end of the\n97\nperiod covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation,\neffective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Our assessment excluded internal controls over financial reporting of\nThis Old House and Nielsen AVA businesses which were acquired during the year and whose total assets represent 1.7%\nand total revenue represent 0.7% of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\n31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nbelow.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”, management excluded from its\nassessment the internal control over financial reporting at the This Old House and Nielsen AVA businesses which\nwere acquired during the year and whose financial statements constitute 1.7% of total assets and 0.7% of total\nrevenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAccordingly, our audit did not include the assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for the This\nOld House and Nielsen AVA businesses.\n98\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 18, 2022"

(“Roku,” “the Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nMexico, and Canada by hours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV. We believe that all TV content and all TV advertising will be streamed. The shift\nof the TV ecosystem to streaming continues and is expanding TV’s capabilities for consumers, content publishers,\nadvertisers, and other industry participants. TV streaming is now mainstream. In 2022, for the first time viewers\nin the United States spent more TV time streaming than watching cable, and “cutting the cord” from traditional TV\nservices has accelerated. Essentially every major media company has entered TV streaming and launched a streaming\nservice, with several expanding beyond pure subscription models to new ad-supported options. Similarly, advertisers\ncan use TV streaming to reach consumers that are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV while also benefiting\nfrom the digital advertising capabilities that TV streaming platforms deliver.\nOur Strategy\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nconsumers, content publishers, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we connect consumers to the\nentertainment they love, enable content publishers to build, engage, and monetize large audiences, and provide\nadvertisers with unique capabilities to reach consumers. The foundation of our platform is the Roku operating\nsystem (the “Roku OS”), which is purpose built for TV streaming.\nThe Roku OS powers our Roku streaming devices. Roku streaming devices include Roku streaming players, Roku\nStreambars, and TVs powered by Roku OS (which include TVs that are manufactured and sold by our licensed Roku TV\npartners (“Roku TV models”) and our own TVs that will be available to purchase beginning in 2023 (“Roku-branded\nTVs”)). We license the Roku OS to our licensed Roku TV partners who leverage our smart TV reference designs, and\nthen manufacture and sell Roku TV models. In January 2023, we announced the launch of Roku Select and Roku Plus\nSeries TVs, a new line of Roku-branded TVs that will be designed, made, and sold by us, which will also be powered\nby the Roku OS. The Roku OS is designed to run on low-cost hardware which enables us and our licensed Roku TV\npartners to sell streaming players and TVs at affordable prices. Consumers connect their Roku streaming devices to\nour streaming platform via a broadband network and are able to access a wide selection of content through a\nstreaming experience that is both delightful and easy to use.\nThe features and functionality of our platform, powered by the Roku OS, enable us to serve content publishers,\nadvertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, and other industry participants. Content publishers can reach our highly-\nengaged user base of 70.0 million active accounts and use our billing services and data insight tools. Advertisers\nreach TV viewers at scale with targeted and measurable ads. Licensed Roku TV partners can build market share by\noffering smart TVs in a range of sizes and price points, and retailers can offer customers Roku’s highly-rated\nstreaming devices online and in stores. We continue to focus significant resources to advance the Roku OS; to\nprovide an industry-leading platform for our consumers, content publishers, and advertisers; to obtain content for\nour platform that attracts users, including our own original content; and to extend Roku’s advantage as the global\nshift to TV streaming continues.\nIn 2022, we extended our ecosystem and launched new smart home products to build new service revenue streams. Our\nsmart home product offering includes cameras, video doorbells, plugs, light bulbs, and light strips, along with a\nRoku Smart Home mobile app for iOS and Android. We offer subscription plans for our cameras and video doorbells\nthat provide users with the ability to view cloud recordings of the videos and to receive AI-based alerts (e.g.,\nperson, package, vehicle, pet). One of our smart home priorities is interoperability, and Roku Smart Home is\ncompatible with Google Home, Alexa, and Roku Voice. The Roku video doorbells and cameras also integrate with the\nRoku OS, allowing users to view live video streams and receive real-time notifications directly on their TVs. The\nproducts are available on our website at Roku.com and in-store exclusively at Walmart, America’s #1 retailer, in\nnearly 3,500 locations where Roku is the #1 smart home brand by shelf space. Similar to our TV streaming business\nmodel, we plan to build scale with these devices and then monetize through smart home services.\n5\nTable o f Contents\nOur Business Model\nThree core areas of focus define our business model. First, we grow scale by increasing our active accounts.\nSecond, we grow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform. And third, we grow\nmonetization of the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Furthermore, our business model is\ndesigned to fulfill the needs of the participants in the TV streaming ecosystem: consumers, content publishers,\nadvertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, other device licensees, and retailers.\nScale: Increasing the number of active accounts\nWe make access to TV streaming affordable in part by offering a broad lineup of streaming players, at various price\npoints, that customers can use to easily turn (nearly) any TV into a smart TV. Audio is an important part of the TV\nstreaming experience, and we also offer the Roku Streambar (a soundbar with a built-in streaming player), Roku\nwireless speakers that seamlessly connect to TVs powered by Roku OS, and Roku Wireless Subwoofers. Additionally, we\noffer customers the choice to build an audio experience with third-party products through The Roku TV Ready\nprogram. Through this partnership with audio companies, we enable their audio products to work seamlessly with TVs\npowered by Roku OS. On a periodic basis, we launch new streaming players and provide updates via the Roku OS to\ncontinuously offer an exceptional TV streaming experience with the highest performance at an affordable price.\nWe also license the Roku OS to licensed Roku TV partners that manufacture and sell Roku TV models that integrate\nthe Roku OS to enable basic TV functions and connect to our TV streaming platform. We have driven strong active\naccount growth through our Roku TV licensing program. Using our reference designs results in relatively low\nhardware costs, enabling these TV brand licensees to manufacture and sell smart TVs that are competitively priced\nfor consumers and that are automatically updated whenever we issue a Roku OS update.\nWe also recently announced the launch of a new line of Roku-branded TVs (the Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs)\nthat will be designed, made, and sold by us in 2023. These TVs will complement our successful Roku TV licensing\nprogram. We believe our Roku-branded TVs will enable us to further grow our leadership position and expand into the\nhigher-end spectrum of performance TVs. Roku-branded TVs will also help us innovate more quickly in all aspects of\nhardware and software and test directly with consumers, improving the product and consumer experience and\nstrengthening the entire Roku TV ecosystem.\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telecommunications service operators that distribute co-branded\nplayers to their subscribers in their markets.\nThrough the Roku platform, we provide consumers tremendous choice, value, and an exceptional user experience. We\nhave been able to significantly scale our active account base over a multi-year period. In 2022, we added 9.9\nmillion net new active accounts, ending the year with 70.0 million active accounts.\nEngagement: Growing streaming hours\nWe believe that offering users a wide range of content and an easy-to-use interface drives increased engagement by\ndelivering a better overall streaming experience. Streaming hours on our platform grew from 73.2 billion hours in\n2021 to 87.4 billion hours in 2022, as our active accounts grew through the distribution of Roku streaming devices.\nThrough our streaming platform, we make it easy for our users to watch their favorite TV shows and movies, as well\nas listen to their favorite music and podcasts. Furthermore, we believe our platform offers users an exceptional TV\nstreaming experience through a user interface that is delightful and easy to use. From the Roku home screen, our\nusers can easily find and access TV shows, movies, news, sports, and more across a wide variety of channels\navailable on our streaming platform. In 2022, we added Live TV and What to Watch features to the Roku Home Screen\nMenu to make it even easier for viewers to quickly find the content they want. We also launched an all-new Sports\nexperience that gives consumers easy access to live and upcoming sports across the Roku platform from a centralized\nlocation. And Roku’s powerful universal search makes it fast and easy for users to find the content they are\nlooking for — regardless of the channel it is on. Additionally, users have choice in how much they want to spend on\ncontent through a broad array of options on an ad-supported, subscription, or transactional basis. Our direct\nrelationship with our users provides us with detailed insights about their behavior on our platform, including\ncertain content they search for, the channels they install, the channels they watch, and certain content that they\npurchase or subscribe to on our platform. This first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as\ncontent recommendations to improve our users’ experience.\n6\nTable o f Contents\nOur significant scale, ability to reach highly engaged streamers, tools that enable seamless sign ups (like Roku\nPay), and marketing/discovery features make us an attractive platform to content publishers. They can also reach\nthose users who no longer use or never used traditional TV services. As consumers shift to TV streaming, content\npublishers that use our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage users directly.\nThe Roku Channel is our owned and operated streaming channel that drives engagement on our platform by providing\nusers with free, ad-supported access to a large and broad library of content. This content is available both on\ndemand and through more than 350 linear channels — all accessible from a single app on our platform. The Roku\nChannel also offers paid, subscription-based content from dozens of content partners through Premium Subscriptions,\nwhich gives users the ability to browse content before signing up, obtain free trials for subscriptions, sign up in\none-click, and enjoy simple subscription management with a single monthly bill. In 2022, The Roku Channel was a top\n5 channel on our platform in the U.S. by both Active Account Reach and Streaming Hour engagement.\nThe Roku Channel is a core strategic asset that simultaneously benefits consumers, content partners, and\nadvertisers, while generating increasing platform revenue. For viewers, The Roku Channel is a compelling\ndestination for a diverse selection of free and paid entertainment, providing content through linear channels and\non demand offerings. For content owners, The Roku Channel provides a variety of options to distribute and monetize\ncontent through both licensing agreements and Premium Subscriptions. And for both content owners and advertisers,\nThe Roku Channel delivers a large and engaged audience at scale that we believe will continue to grow. Owning and\noperating both The Roku Channel and the Roku platform creates unique value, making us a leader in free content,\npositioning us to be a valuable partner to content owners, and providing a large source of ad inventory.\nOur strategy for The Roku Channel is to drive engagement through a broad portfolio of quality content consisting of\nTV shows, movies, news, sports, lifestyle, and more in both on demand and linear channel formats. The foundation of\nour content strategy is revenue share and fixed licensing agreements and, to a smaller extent, original\nprogramming. We launched our original programming, “Roku Originals” on The Roku Channel in 2021 and have continued\nto build upon this library as it offers compelling, exclusive value to both consumers and advertisers. Our content\nspend is intended to be commensurate with the growth trajectory of The Roku Channel and also the broader macro\nenvironment.\nThe Roku Channel is available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and in 2022, we launched The\nRoku Channel in Mexico. In the United States, The Roku Channel features a diverse lineup of more than 80,000 free\nmovies and TV shows, including original and exclusive content, 350+ free linear television channels, free ad-\nsupported entertainment for kids and family with more than 10,000 titles, and more than 50 premium subscription\nchannels.\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe generate platform revenue primarily through advertising and content distribution services. Our sophisticated and\nleading TV streaming platform enables advertisers and content publishers to reach audiences that are increasingly\nunreachable on traditional TV. Each user on our platform creates multiple revenue opportunities for Roku, whether\nthey are opening the Roku home page, enjoying ad-supported content, purchasing content, or simply using a Roku\nremote. We monetize our users’ engagement on our platform through a variety of services and capabilities, including\nsales of subscription or transaction-based content, billing services, brand sponsorship and promotions, and video\nadvertising in ad-supported channels. We believe that running relevant display and video ads enhances the user\nexperience on our platform. We measure monetization of our platform by calculating the average revenue per user\n(“ARPU”), which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model, and gross profit. ARPU (which we\nmeasure on a trailing 12-month basis) was $41.68 as of December 31, 2022 compared to $40.67 as of December 31,\n2021. Our gross profit was $1,441.1 million and $1,408.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively.\nWe make it easy for content publishers to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary\nbusiness models: subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand\nchannels and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution (“vMVPD”) services; ad-supported, which\nincludes advertising video on demand (“AVOD”) channels with on demand content that do not charge a subscription fee\nto users, as well as free ad-supported streaming TV (“FAST”), which we define as free, ad-supported linear\nstreaming TV; and transaction video on demand (“TVOD”) that includes channels that offer a la carte content\npurchases or rentals. Through Roku Pay, our proprietary platform billing solution, we are also able to assist\ncontent partners with billing services, including billing users for in-channel purchases like content rentals,\nmanaging subscriptions, and customer invoices. Roku Pay allows publishers to enable a frictionless, “one-click”\nsignup within the app, and we believe this key benefit simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and\nretention for our content publishers.\n7\nTable o f Contents\nContent publishers also have access to our media and entertainment promotional capabilities and tools to help them\nattract, engage, and retain viewers by investing in promoting their content to our users on our platform. Content\npublishers can use a variety of ad placements, including native display ads on the Roku home screen or a screen\nsaver to drive channel downloads, promote a channel’s content, and direct traffic to their channels in order to\ndrive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also derive revenue from the sale of branded channel\nbuttons on streaming player and Roku TV remote controls that are intended to increase incremental usage of the\nchannel by allowing users to launch straight into the channel from any screen. Our analytics and reporting assist\ncontent publishers with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles. Using machine learning, we\nalso can help content publishers target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe to their services.\nJust as ads evolved decades ago when TV replaced radio as the primary entertainment medium, ads on TV streaming\noffer new and more performant opportunities than traditional TV. We offer advertisers a unique and effective set of\ntools to reach consumers both on and off the Roku platform. Advertisers are able to leverage the combination of our\nsignificant scale, our direct relationship with our users, and our advertising capabilities to serve relevant\nadvertisements. Advertisers on our platform also can measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their\nreturn on investment.\nOneView is our ad buying platform built for TV streaming. Advertisers use OneView to set up, make changes, and\nmeasure ad campaigns entirely on their own. In a world where all TV ads will be automated and streamed, our\nsoftware and machine learning provide the best way to reach a Roku user wherever they are — on the Roku platform,\nother TV streaming devices, desktop, mobile, and more. Advertisers choose OneView because it is the only ad buying\nplatform with Roku data, ad inventory from The Roku Channel, and new Roku ad experiences that go beyond the\ntraditional TV ad spot.\nWe offer engagement analytics such as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We\nwork with a wide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and\naudience demographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform.\nFurthermore, we have relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data,\nwhich enables our advertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on\ntraditional TV. Additional promotional advertising opportunities include shoppable ads that allow consumers to buy\nproducts right from the TV screen and content sponsorships that give users the opportunity to experience a free\nmovie or show and sponsored themes in our user experience.\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to further differentiate our platform and increase the value we deliver to our\nusers, content publishers, and advertisers. We must regularly update and enhance our platform to meet evolving\nconsumer behavior and provide a best-in-class content delivery and advertising platform. We must provide content\npublishers with best-in-class publishing tools and actionable audience insights. We must continue to innovate and\ninvest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental advertising\nspend on our platform. Accordingly, we plan to continue investing in our business to enhance our competitive\ndifferentiation and drive future growth, but we also plan to continue to improve our operations and operating\nexpense profile to better manage through the challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, we expect our\noperating expense year-over-year growth to significantly decline over the course of 2023. In particular, these\ninvestments will include research and development initiatives to bring new features and technology to our platform;\nsales and marketing efforts to drive increased scale and engagement of our user base; continued investment in both\nlicensed and original content to drive scale and engagement of The Roku Channel; and building out our general and\nadministrative infrastructure to support a global business.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe continue to innovate and launch new ad products. In 2022, we launched Roku’s Advertising Watermark, an industry-\nfirst capability which enables content publishers, advertisers, and technology providers to validate the\nauthenticity of videos ads on the Roku platform. In partnership with Walmart, we launched a product called\nShoppable Ads, which make shopping on TV streaming as easy as it is on social media. Viewers simply press “OK” with\ntheir Roku remote on a shoppable ad and proceed to checkout with their shipping and payment details pre-populated\nfrom Roku Pay. We also announced an industry-first collaboration with Microsoft that will quantify how TV\nadvertising on both traditional TV and TV streaming affects online searches to help marketers measure performance.\nWe launched Nielsen Total Ad Ratings, which provides media measurement across TV streaming, traditional TV,\ndesktop, and mobile. OneView was the first demand-side ad platform to directly integrate with Nielsen’s measurement\nsolution.\n8\nTable o f Contents\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers consumers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to consumers, content\npublishers, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, other device licensees, and retailers is as compelling in\ninternational markets as it is in the United States. Today Roku streaming devices are available in 20+ countries.\nWe are the leading TV streaming platform in the United States, Mexico, and Canada by hours streamed. We continue to\nbuild our foundation for international expansion by establishing teams and offices around the world and investing\nin systems and processes that will support international expansion going forward. In 2022, licensed Roku TV\npartners launched new Roku TV models in Mexico, Canada, and Germany, and we expanded into Australia with Roku TV\nmodels. In international markets, we will continue to focus on building scale first, increasing customer\nengagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously drive active account growth,\nengagement, and monetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities\nare primarily focused on building and expanding relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands,\nretailers, and service operators, and driving sales of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products to\nconsumers through retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships to promote and build awareness\nof the features and advantages of the Roku platform among content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and service\noperators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform to\nincrease effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns.\nOur relationship with content publishers is typically client-direct. Through our dedicated content relationship\nmanagement team, we enter into agreements with content publishers to distribute their app(s) on our platform, or\nlicense their content for The Roku Channel, or both. As part of our distribution agreements with AVOD channels, we\ntypically secure direct access to the content publishers’ video ad inventory for our monetization, and our sales\nefforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content publishers. Whereas our publishers typically\nfeature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large streaming audience across many\nchannels at once using our own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their\ngoals across numerous key performance indicators. We are also developing relationships with more third-party\nplatforms (e.g., retail media networks, demand side platforms, and other strategic partners) to reach marketers\nbuying programmatic advertising on such platforms and to create demand opportunities for Roku ad inventory. Our\nsales teams and products are organized into groups that specialize in the unique needs of each area: (i) agency\nholding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and mid-market clients, (iii) content publishers\nand entertainment brands, (iv) performance and direct to consumer brands, (v) international markets, and (vi) local\nadvertising. In addition, we work with our licensed Roku TV partners to assist in all phases of the development of\nRoku TV models, including development, planning, manufacturing, and marketing.\nIn the United States, the majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products are sold through\ntraditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, including their online sales\nplatforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website (excluding Roku TV models). We\nalso sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon and Walmart collectively accounted\nfor 59% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 57% of our devices revenue for the year\nended December 31, 2021. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and work closely with these\nretailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting. We intend to continue to invest\nsignificant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and device sales. Our revenue and\ngross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage\nof the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during\nholiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our streaming device sales through retailers in an effort to grow our\nactive accounts, which typically reduce our devices gross margin or results in a devices gross loss in the fourth\nquarter.\n9\nTable o f Contents\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, audio\nproducts, TVs, smart home devices, features, and functionality. We work closely with content publishers,\nadvertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, and service operators to understand their current and future needs. We have\ndesigned a product development process that captures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user\nfeedback in the development of new features and enhancements to the Roku platform. We intend to continue to\nsignificantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and enhance our platform and\ncapabilities.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. All\nof our products are manufactured in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asia, and Brazil. Our contracts do\nnot obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific price. Our manufacturers\nprocure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish based upon historical trends and\nanalysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The manufacturers ship our products to our\nthird-party warehouses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil where we ship our products\ndirectly to retailers, wholesale distributors, and consumers.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our products and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprivacy protections and the security of online services. And an increasing number of states have passed, or are\nconsidering, legislation to govern consumer privacy; the U.S. Congress also is considering comprehensive federal\nprivacy legislation. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate impose different, and sometimes more\nstringent, consumer and privacy protections, compared to the United States. Consumer privacy laws are constantly\nchanging and may become more diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the challenges and costs associated with\ncomplying with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit the ability of advertisers to fully\nutilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet.\nTo the extent regulators allow network operators to restrict the flow of content over the internet, such operators\nmay seek to extract fees from us or our content publishers to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in\nblocking, throttling, or other discriminatory practices with respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact\nour business.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\ncertain local content quotas or production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\n10\nTable o f Contents\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,000 issued patents and 500 pending applications in the United\nStates and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our\nproduct offerings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business,\nsee Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on building scale by growing our active accounts, growing engagement by increasing the hours of content\nstreamed through our platform, and growing the monetization of the activities that consumers engage in through our\nplatform.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming devices and companies that license\ntheir operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs as well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach consumers on other content and advertising mediums;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games;\ncompanies that offer smart home products that compete with our new smart home products and services; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices that may be better able attract and retain top talent\nin engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,600 full-time employees located in 14 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees have adopted a\nhybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to use our\nbroad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions. As we grow our business, our goal is to ensure\nthat Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive.\n11\nTable o f Contents\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. Since 2020, the launch of our formal diversity,\nequity, and inclusion (“DEI”) strategy, we have made considerable progress on elevating awareness of DEI, promoting\ndialogue and empathy, implementing employee resource groups, and expanding representation on The Roku Channel and\nthe Roku platform.\nOur Vice President of Global Talent Management and Inclusion leads our growing Inclusion Strategy team with a\ndirector of DEI and two program managers. We also have full-time resources embedded in our Talent Acquisition team.\nThey partner across Roku to advance DEI across our employee experience, recruiting, and customer experience. These\nareas comprise our three-part DEI framework: Inclusive Employee Experience, Inclusive Recruiting, and Inclusive\nCustomer Experience.\nInclusive Employee Experience : We facilitate an inclusive employee experience through our pay equity analysis,\nlearning and development offerings, internal and external communications, employee resource groups (“ERG”), and\nmentoring. In 2022, we continued our U.S. pay equity analysis to help ensure we pay fairly and equitably across\ngender and ethnicity, year over year. Our six voluntary and employee-led ERGs are highly engaged and foster a\ndiverse and inclusive workplace, build internal community, encourage career growth and networking, and support\nsocial impact partnerships. In 2022, we delivered a significant rollout of DEI offerings in the areas of bias,\ninclusive conversations, allyship, and subtle acts of exclusion. We also increased the frequency of DEI\ncommunications to amplify our commitment, both internally and externally.\nInclusive Recruiting : Our Inclusive Recruiting Program Manager and DEI specialists embedded within our Talent\nAcquisition team directly contribute to our efforts to be inclusive. In addition, every member of our Talent\nAcquisition team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit candidates from different backgrounds. To that\nend, all recruiters are equipped to discuss DEI best practices with hiring managers to ensure we continue to widen\nthe candidate pipeline for all roles and create inclusive recruiting experiences. Furthermore, our U.S. university\nrecruiting and intern programs embed DEI into their strategies so that our recruiting pipelines include\nhistorically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and underrepresented clubs and\nprograms across other schools where we recruit.\nOur external relationships are also focused on organizations that reflect underrepresented communities, including\ntechnical and non-technical women and underrepresented minority organizations, to enable our hiring managers and\nrecruiters to attend or speak at related conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story\nto a wider audience.\nInclusive Customer Experience : As a TV streaming platform with both U.S. and international viewers, we believe our\ncustomer experiences should reflect the diversity of our customers. We offer a slate of “inclusion zones”\n(including Black Voices, Pride, Latino Voices, Women’s Voices, and Asian and Pacific Islander Voices) on the Roku\nplatform that highlight and celebrate related stories from various content providers.\nCommunity Engagement and Social Impact\nWe have developed a Social Impact program that engages our local communities through employee volunteerism. Our\nprogram partners with organizations that provide opportunities for employees to mentor high school students through\nactivities such as career panels, industry masterclasses, and hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math\n(STEM) challenges.\nLearning and Talent Development\nOur Learning and Talent Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to\nsupport our strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive new hire\nonboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources employees need to increase our new hires’\nspeed to productivity. In addition to mandatory training covering anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, and\nprivacy, we offer employees a suite of highly encouraged training offerings covering topics such as high-\nperformance feedback, active listening, and communication and presentation skills. Managers are provided with\ntraining on expectations for managers, interviewing and hiring, and performance management to support new and newly\npromoted leaders in managing and leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access to on-demand technical\nand non-technical skill development through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase,\nand custom-build additional training materials to support our global employees’ performance and development needs.\n12\nTable o f Contents\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation, we consider what they would be paid by another\nemployer, what we would have to pay to replace them if they leave Roku, and the amount we would pay to retain them.\nGenerally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of salary and equity awards rather than offering\nspecific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by different employees. We generally do not pay cash\nbonuses (other than to employees eligible for sales commissions) or have performance-based equity awards because\nour employees are expected to work at the highest level regardless of possible bonus payouts or awards.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

industry is highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content\nowners and aggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to\ndifferentiate ourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and\nretain users and our business will be harmed.\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and\nretaining users on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need\nto be able to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to\nthe content they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the\nfeatures and functionality of our streaming platform for users, content publishers, and advertisers. We also must\neffectively support popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime\nVideo, Disney+, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in the TV\nstreaming industry.\nLarge technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku\nstreaming devices. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart\nTVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into\nsmart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have greater financial resources than we do and can\nsubsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements in order to promote their other products\nand services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, and increase streaming\nhours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or\nthat provide a better streaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands\nthrough advertising than we do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast, offer TV\nstreaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing consumer\nbases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in the TV\nstreaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to Roku streaming devices, we\nmay not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours, revenue, gross profit or ARPU.\nWe also compete for streaming hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may\nprefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming\ncould adversely impact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing\npressure, lower revenue and gross profit, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our platform or our other\nproducts to gain or maintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading\nTV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and\nsupport, and device distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards and unknown future developments\nmay require further investments in the development of Roku streaming devices, our platform and our other products.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive\nposition. In addition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger\ncustomer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which\nprovide them with advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they\nmay be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion,\nsales, and distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products\nbetter than we can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or\nstandards and may be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our\nsales volume, revenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and\notherwise harm our business.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer audio products, including Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers,\nand Roku wireless subwoofers, and Roku smart home products, including indoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells,\nsmart lighting, and smart plugs. As a result, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio speakers\nand soundbars and other TV peripheral devices, as well as makers of other smart home products. If these products do\nnot operate as designed or do not enhance the TVs powered by Roku OS or other viewing experiences as we intend, our\nusers’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may impact the overall demand for our products and\nour partners’ Roku TV models.\n16\nTable o f Contents\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of over-the-top (“OTT”) advertising and OTT advertising\nplatforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, including social media and other digital platforms, as well as traditional media,\nsuch as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content\nand other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These\ncompetitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may\nadversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from\nadvertising. For example, Netflix and Disney+ recently launched ad-supported tiers in their streaming services,\nwhich may further increase competition for streaming advertising revenue. If we are unable to increase our revenue\nfrom advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to further optimize and\nmeasure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory, and expanding our advertising sales team and\nprogrammatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be harmed. We may not be able to compete\neffectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue\nand would harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,\nsuch as traditional TV, radio, and print, and to advertising through social media and other digital platforms. The\nfuture growth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising and on advertisers increasing their spending\non advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers have shown growing interest in OTT advertising,\nwe cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to traditional TV\nadvertising or shift their advertising spending to social media and other digital platforms (rather than to us). In\naddition, if we are unable to compete with social media and other digital platforms to win business from\nadvertisers and agencies who have traditionally advertised on these platforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small\nor medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be limited. If advertisers, or their agency\nrelationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we\nexpect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nFinally, there is political pressure in some countries to limit OTT advertising (including limiting the advertising\nthat may be shown to viewers of children’s content) or impose local content requirements on OTT services, which\ncould pose a threat to our services.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising and related services, and content\ndistribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and entertainment promotional\nspending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls). As such,\nwe are seeking to expand the number of active accounts and increase the number of hours that are streamed across\nour platform in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user base grows and as we\nincrease the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively monetize our expanding\nuser base and streaming activity. The total number of streaming hours, however, does not correlate with platform\nrevenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed or every user on our\nplatform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming\ncontent, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a player is connected to a TV, and the\nviewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular\nstreaming channel may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe\nthat this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes. Since the first\nquarter of 2020, all Roku devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when content has been\ncontinuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This feature\nperiodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel\nif the user does not respond affirmatively. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have\nsimilar features within their channels.\nOur ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or\nprevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect viewing data or to\nprovide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to collect data\nregarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our legal\nobligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing data\nfrom many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users.\n17\nTable o f Contents\nOther channels available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on\nincreasing user engagement and time spent within their channels by allowing users to purchase additional content\nand streaming services within their channels; when users purchase these additional services within these channels,\nwe may earn less revenue than when the services are purchased directly from us. If our users spend most of their\ntime within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user\ninformation, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant\nadvertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit.\nAdditionally, our distribution agreements with our most popular channels are renegotiated periodically; thus, even\nif we are currently able to monetize streaming hours within a channel, we may not be able to do so in the future.\nIf we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nOur efforts to monetize our streaming platform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not\ncontinue to grow as we expect, and our platform revenue growth has been, and may continue to be, lower than\nexpected due to advertisers significantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to inflationary pressures,\nrecessionary fears or other reasons that are out of our control. In addition, advertisers’ spending commitments,\nsuch as those we obtain in connection with annual TV Upfront presentations, are typically not fully binding, and\nthe revenue we receive from such commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. This means that in\norder to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we\nwill need to attract significantly more advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-\nsupported content that results in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. Accordingly, there\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-\nsupported content.\nIf we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView ad platform or if we are not\nsuccessful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.\nThrough our OneView ad platform, advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage\ntheir OTT, desktop and mobile advertising campaigns. OneView leverages the demand-side platform developed by\ndataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of our\nproprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic OTT ad buying is an emerging market, and\nour current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not shift to programmatic ad buying from other\nbuying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for programmatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or\ndevelops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising agencies may not use OneView or we may not attract\nprospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and our business could be harmed. In addition, if\nOneView does not have the functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be\nable to attract their advertising spend to OneView, or our existing customers may not maintain or increase their\nspend on OneView. Moreover, our ownership of OneView may negatively impact the ability of OneView to purchase\nadvertising on non-Roku platforms. If we fail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to our customers’\nevolving needs, advertisers and advertising agencies will not adopt OneView, and our business may be harmed. We\nalso may not be able to compete effectively with more established demand-side platforms or be able to adapt to\nchanges or trends in programmatic OTT advertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue and\nharm our business.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV\npartners and manufacturing partners in the United States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service\noperators.\nWe have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand and manufacturing\npartners. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and\ninternational markets. In the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has\nmaterially contributed to our active account growth, streaming hours, and platform monetization efforts. This\ngrowth has primarily been driven by North America; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to\ncertain international markets and represents a growing share of new active accounts. We license the Roku OS and our\nsmart TV reference designs to certain licensed Roku TV partners to manufacture Roku TV models. We do not typically\nreceive, nor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we expect to incur\nexpenses in connection with these commercial agreements. The primary economic benefits that we derive from these\nlicense arrangements have been and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily from growing our active accounts,\nincreasing streaming hours, and generating content distribution and advertising-related revenue on our platform. If\nthese arrangements do not continue to result in increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth\ndoes not in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\n18\nTable o f Contents\nWhile we recently announced the launch of a new line of Roku-branded TVs (the Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs)\nthat will be designed, made, and sold by us, the loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner in the near\nfuture could harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from\nother partners and distribution channels, increase our marketing costs, and result in the loss of revenue. If we\nare not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with any of these third parties, or if we\nencounter technological, content licensing, or other impediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or\nmaintain our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have also developed licensing relationships with certain service operators, primarily in international markets;\nhowever, this program has been decreasing in scale in recent years, as we have shifted the focus of our\ninternational growth to the sale of Roku streaming devices and expanding our Roku OS licensing program with\nlicensed Roku TV partners. Based on the decreasing scale of our licensing program for service operators, including\ntermination of these relationships, we expect that the number of active accounts generated from this program will\ncontinue to decline, which may impact the overall growth rate of our active accounts in international markets.\nOur licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential\npartners include TV brands, cable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers. Under these license\narrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources these entities\ndedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their forecasts and\nanticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to meet their forecasts or such\nlaunches in the future. If our licensed Roku TV partners or service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts\nor such launches for distributing licensed streaming devices or choose to deploy competing streaming solutions\nwithin their product lines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed\non our platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the top three streaming services represented over 50%\nof all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically\nstreamed a large percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, our active\naccounts, or Roku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming channels, streaming channel features, and content. In order to remain\ncompetitive, we must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels, streaming channel features, and\ncontent, particularly as we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by Roku OS, or enter new\nmarkets, including international markets. If we are not successful in helping our content publishers launch and\nmaintain streaming channels and streaming channel features that attract and retain a significant number of users on\nour streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be harmed. Our\nability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel offerings on a cost-effective\nbasis largely depends on our ability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream\ncertain channels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of\npopular streaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand\ntheir audiences on our platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nThe non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content publishers may result in the removal of certain\nchannels or channel features from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates and rights to terminate under certain circumstances. Our agreements with content publishers\ngenerally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the end of the term by the content\npublisher under certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter\nbankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content publishers’ security or other platform certification\nrequirements.\n19\nTable o f Contents\nUpon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing\ncontent from these content publishers on our streaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future\nmay not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements\nhave expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, or if a\ncontent publisher terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we may be required to temporarily or\npermanently remove certain channels or channel features from our streaming platform.\nThe loss of such channels or channel features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our\nbusiness. More broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to\nus, or at all, or if these content publishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may\nlose channel partners or users and our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell\nour available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to\nsell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure\ncontent that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient\nsupply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are\nalso dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may\nfail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on\nour streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform\nvaries greatly among channels. Accordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video ad\ninventory on our platform. For certain channels, including YouTube’s ad-supported channel, we have no access to\nvideo ad inventory at this time, and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services\nintroduce new ad-supported tiers to their streaming services, we have in the past and in the future may not be able\nto reach agreement on access to video ad inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. The\namount, quality, and cost of video ad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow\nand maintain a sufficient supply of quality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected\nnot to participate in our new home screen menu features or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage\nwithin their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language\nin order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels on our streaming platform. If we introduce\nnew features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a change may not comply with certain content\npublishers’ certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers may find other languages, such as\nHTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their channels on other platforms. If\nkey content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop channels for, do not\nvalue and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine\nthat our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their certification requirements, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform are not relevant or\nnot engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver\nrelevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our users. Existing and\nprospective advertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and media and entertainment\npromotional spending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem\nirrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of\nour advertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but we may not be\nsuccessful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and content publishers.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant, overly intrusive or too frequent and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using our\nplatform, which will harm our business.\n20\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our operation of The Roku Channel.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television\nseries, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses\nin connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily\nthrough advertising. For example, we previously acquired content rights, including rights to certain projects in\ndevelopment, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and announced that The Roku Channel\nwould become the home of such content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old House\nbusiness, which own and produce the “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related\nbusiness lines, to further the growth strategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel. We also\ncommission original content that we own and distribute on The Roku Channel.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The\nagreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make\nspecific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these\nagreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new\nagreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the\nduration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable\nterms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku\nChannel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers,\nusage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, following the Quibi and This Old House transactions and the launch of our advertising brand studio, we\nare producing content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited experience\nproducing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing to our\nusers and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with content\nproduction, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not\nrelevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available\ncontent, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not\ngenerate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition, we distribute The\nRoku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising through the\ndistribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,\nour business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our\nplatform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from\nvarious content publishers. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or\nsubscriptions for any reason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content\npublishers or by other means for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from\nwithin their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn\nfrom sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their\nspending on such in-channel transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business\nmay be harmed.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that are outside of our control,\nwhich makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nTV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth\nand profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming\nplatform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an\nentertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access\n(including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband content delivery, broadband\nservice providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content traveling on their networks, the\nquality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for users relative to other sources of content, the\nquality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms, and other macroeconomic conditions.\nAccordingly, our growth and the future evolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact our\nsuccess, is dependent on many factors that are outside of our control.\n21\nTable o f Contents\nWe and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective\nproducts, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners\ncould experience lower product sales.\nTo continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and\nfor the Roku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon.\nWe also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers\nsuch as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, and MediaMarkt in Germany. As we have only recently expanded to\ncertain international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or relationships with retailers for\nthose markets as compared to our sales channels in the United States or our competitors in international markets.\nAmazon and Walmart in total accounted for 59% of our devices revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,\nand 57% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOur retailers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. We have no minimum purchase\ncommitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or distributors. If one or several retailers or\ndistributors were to discontinue selling our products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to\nprominently display those devices in their stores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their\nbrick and mortar locations, the volume of our products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could\ndecrease, which would harm our business. If any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work\nexclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to, other operating system developers,\nthis may adversely impact our ability to continue to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV\nbrands and our ability to continue to grow active accounts and monetize the Roku OS. Traditional retailers have\nlimited shelf and end cap space in their stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited\nprime website product placement space. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more\nextensive product lines, stronger brand identity and greater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google,\npossesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In addition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own\ncompetitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart home devices, is able to market and promote these products more\nprominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or promote our products on its website. Any reduction in our\nability to place and promote our products, or increased competition for available shelf or website placement, could\nrequire us to increase our marketing or other expenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in\nreduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In particular, the availability of product\nplacement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are\nunable to effectively sell our products during these periods, our business would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be\npositively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our\nproducts or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of the\nRoku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content that our content publishers\nprovide, may be out of our control, yet users may nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be\nable to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our\ncompetitors are larger companies and may have greater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through\ntraditional advertising, digital advertising or website product placement. If we are unable to execute on building\na strong brand, it may be difficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in\nthe marketplace, therefore our ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may\nbe harmed.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of channels, representing a variety of\ncontent from a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and\nwatch, and they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to Roku streaming devices. While\nwe have policies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates\nthird-party rights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content.\nControversies related to the content included on certain channels that we distribute have resulted in, and could in\nthe future result in, negative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may\nharm our business.\n22\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.\nThis credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In\naddition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated\nperiod of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In\naddition, we typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising\nindustry. While we attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies,\nwe are not always successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter\ncycles than our accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of\ncredit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or\nthrough our demand-side platform. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit\nlosses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-\noffs occur. In the future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may\nincrease over time. Any increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies\non time or at all, our business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we\ncould lose users, advertisers, content partners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.\nOur users depend on our customer support organization to resolve issues relating to our products and our streaming\nplatform. A high level of support is critical for the success of our business. We currently outsource the majority\nof our customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end\nusers. In addition, we train our licensed Roku TV partners and service operator licensees to provide first-level\ncustomer support to users of Roku TV models. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage our third-party\ncustomer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if that support organization does not succeed\nin helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability\nto monetize our streaming platform, to sell our products to consumers and could harm our reputation with potential\nnew customers and our licensees.\nWe must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new\nproducts and services expose our business to new risks.\nWe must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet\nchanging consumer demands. In particular, we recently introduced Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs (a new line\nof Roku-branded TVs that will be designed, made, and sold by us in 2023) and Roku smart home products (including\nindoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells, smart lighting, and smart plugs) and related subscription services.\nThe introduction of a new product or service is a complex task, involving significant expenditures in research and\ndevelopment, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to new risks. The introduction\nof new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may result in new or enhanced\ngovernmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications that could adversely affect\nour business, reputation, or financial results. For example, we have faced and may continue to face new\nintellectual property infringement claims related to new products and services we have introduced. In addition, our\nentrance into entirely new lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV streaming and advertising,\nsuch as our launch of Roku smart home products, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ\nfrom the risks we face as a result of our TV streaming business.\nWhether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our\nability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to\nour streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. The development of\nnew products and services is a highly complex process, and while our research and development efforts are aimed at\nsolving increasingly complex problems, we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. The successful\ndevelopment and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\n23\nTable o f Contents\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments, which could impact the\npricing, timing and availability of new products and depress consumer demand, limit the ability of our contract\nmanufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies, and lead to shortages;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing\nmishaps, and shipping delays; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract\nmanufacturers, and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among\nother issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from labor disputes, strikes, mechanical\nissues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health crises; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new products.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component\nshortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems have impaired, and could in the future\nimpair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our\ncontract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our\nretailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our\nproducts. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete\ndesired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract\nmanufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because\nof inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they\ndecide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or terminated, and we would\nhave to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract manufacturers. Alternative\ncontract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our production\nrequirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely basis, or at\nall. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could require us to\nreduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our revenue, or incur\nhigher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.\n24\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,\nare located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,\nsocial, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or\ndisrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the current tensions\nbetween Taiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese\nsuppliers, our supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international\nlocation of these facilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade\nrestrictions on exports or imports.\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems\nwith their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.\nSome of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or\nexclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to\nretailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in\ntariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports: restrictions, by the\nUnited States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or\ncomponents for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.\nOur licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or\nsuppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku\nTV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV\nmodels at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models\nsold at retail, resulting in slower active account and streaming hour growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models\ncould harm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our\ncontract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nproducts are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many\nmonths in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess\ncomponents and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or\nbuild excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have\nagreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our\ndecision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess\nsupply commitments, our business may be harmed.\nConversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material\nor component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities\navailable to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In\naddition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship\nour products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross\nmargin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately\nforecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nobtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to\nour retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players\nand TVs powered by Roku OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi front-\nend module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a second\nsource.\n25\nTable o f Contents\nAlthough this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering\ndevelopment and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also\ncreates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or\nmaterial supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other\nexport or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their\ncomponents (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.\nThere is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired\nby or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on\nallocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control\nrestrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,\nor logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary\npressures, geopolitical conflict, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and\nmay in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,\nand which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source\nsupplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,\nand may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and\nharm our business.\nIf our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content\npublishers and other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via\nRoku streaming devices offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all\nchannels and other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, including virtual multi-\nchannel video programming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings,\ntechnologies, and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not\nprovide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are\nmade to those offerings that are not compatible with Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase active\naccount growth and user engagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will be\nharmed.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, our recently announced Roku-\nbranded TVs, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such products to function well with these\nofferings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content publishers have the right to test and\ncertify our new products before we can publish their channels. The certification processes can be time consuming\nand introduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new\nproducts on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain certifications, our product release\nplans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products to all licensed Roku TV partners or\nwe may not continue to offer certain channels. To continue to grow our active accounts and user engagement, we will\nneed to prioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies, and\nsystems, including our recently announced smart home products. If we are unable to maintain consistent operability\nof Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms, our business could be harmed. In\naddition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, such as virtual\nservice operators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of Roku\nstreaming devices. We may not successfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these\nofferings, technologies, or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings,\ntechnologies, or systems, our business could be harmed.\n26\nTable o f Contents\nOur products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in\nways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have contained and may in the future\ncontain hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any number of ways\nin our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, data\nloss or poor quality, device malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. Some errors may only be\ndiscovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be detected under certain\ncircumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance\nprocesses, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such update.\nThe introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a\nlimited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product\nsupport, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of\ntime. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in\nrevenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information\nliability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with\nour end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be\nupheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely\naffect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate\nor future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown\nto us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they\ncould cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by\nwhich our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network\nrouter. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access\npoint, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to\nrecall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable cost and expense. Should we have a\nwidespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to\ndevelop new products or streaming platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize or enable certain industry standard and other commercially available technology in our products and\nstreaming platform that is licensed by third parties. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to\nour products and on our streaming platform, we may be required to license additional technologies from third\nparties. These third-party licenses may be unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party licenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies\nwith lower quality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of\nour products, streaming platform, and our business.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior\nquarters, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability again in\nthe near term or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we\nachieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near\nterm or at all. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $588.0 million. We generally expect our\noperating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to expand our operations and invest in growth and new\nareas, although we expect operating expense year-over-year growth to significantly decline over the course of 2023.\nIf our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may not be able to\nachieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of reasons,\nincluding without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may encounter\nunforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may result in\nlosses in future periods.\n27\nTable o f Contents\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-\nto-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;\nour ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and\nmonetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or\nother macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is\ncurrently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels, or features;\nthe addition or loss of popular content or channels;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;\ndelays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or\ndistribution chains; and\nan increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party\nintellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment (which generates revenue from\nthe sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products, and related accessories, and licensing\narrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV brand partners) has lower gross margins compared to our\nplatform segment (which generates revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\ndemand-side platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media\nand entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons\non remote controls). Gross margins on our streaming players, audio products, and smart home products vary across\nmodels and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component\ncosts, device returns, and other cost fluctuations.\nIn addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or sales channel mix, component cost increases, price\ncompetition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or\nreduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin in an\neffort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our gross profit. As a result, our devices revenue may\nnot increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless we are able to continue to increase our\nplatform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be unable to grow gross profit and our business\nwill be harmed. For example, in the past, global supply chain disruptions have resulted in shipping delays,\nincreased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices, which negatively affected our\ndevices gross margin. If a reduction in gross margin does not result in an increase in our active accounts or an\nincrease in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may suffer, and our business may be\nharmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, lower\ngross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower than we anticipate, our financial results\nmay suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant\ndemands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\n28\nTable o f Contents\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nexpand our product offerings;\nsupport our licensed Roku TV partners and service operators;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to\nexecute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows. For example, in November 2022, we approved a workforce reduction plan\ndesigned to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs and better align our workforce with current\nbusiness needs, priorities, and near term growth expectations. If we are unable to manage our growth and expansion\nplans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and\nhave greater experience managing a global organization.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and\nregulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade\n(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content\nrestrictions, and local content and advertising requirements, among others;\nexposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK\nBribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws\nprohibiting improper payments to government officials and requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records\nand a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that\nconsumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by\nincumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain\ninternational markets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, whatever the cause, including\ndue to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of\nUkraine), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions (such as the tension\nbetween China and Taiwan), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;\n29\nTable o f Contents\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World\nTrade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;\nany pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the\nuse of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such\nservices to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for\nmaterials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange\nRate Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report for additional information);\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIn addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our business model in international markets. Three\ncore areas of focus define our business model: first, we grow scale by increasing our active accounts; second, we\ngrow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform; and, third, we grow monetization\nof the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Even if we are able to increase our active\naccounts in international markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our streaming hours or monetize user\nactivity in those markets. Further, our ARPU may be lower in international markets than in the United States. If we\ninvest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully\nand in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit\nare traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total\nnet revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the\naverage selling prices of our products through retailers in an effort to grow our active accounts, which typically\nreduce our devices gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our product sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, reductions in consumer discretionary spending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our\nsupply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or air freight delays, or for any\nother reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, in the quarter\nended December 31, 2022, macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressures negatively affected consumer\nelectronics sales during the holiday season. In addition, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the\npast, and may in the future, adversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver\nproducts to retailers during holiday seasons.\nA substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nbenefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue\nshortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in\nthe short term, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\n30\nTable o f Contents\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our\nemployees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources\nto identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. Because we face\nsignificant competition to attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer,\ncompetitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, many\ncompanies now offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for employees from\nemployers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and may in the\nfuture need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition and other\nbusiness and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees\nnecessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of\nreplacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\nany workforce reduction, such as the reduction we announced in November 2022, could harm employee morale and\nnegatively impact employee recruiting and retention. In addition, the equity ownership of many of our employees\ncould create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees\nand our business.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,\nand other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and\nfinancial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, licensed Roku TV partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in\nerrors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could\nadversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and\ndisputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient financial\nreturns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions. In addition, the process of\nintegrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and\nexpenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies involve areas of operation in\nwhich we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies in\ninternational markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across\ndifferent cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks\nassociated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without\nincurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address such risks\nsuccessfully, our business could be harmed.\n31\nTable o f Contents\nWe have outstanding debt, and our credit facility provides our lender with a first-priority lien against\nsubstantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may\nlimit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe entered into a credit agreement, dated February 19, 2019 (as amended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”)\namong us, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders and\nissuing banks from time to time party thereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and\ncollateral agent (the “Agent”), providing for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal\namount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan A\nfacility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement contains a number of\naffirmative and negative covenants, which may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability\nto respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions. The Credit Agreement also\ncontains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00,\ntested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on the basis of the prior period of our four consecutive fiscal\nquarters. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we granted the Agent a security interest in substantially all of our\nand our subsidiary guarantors’ assets.\nIn November 2019, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million from the Term Loan A Facility. We\nalso had outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 totaling $37.7 million against the Revolving Credit\nFacility. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities” elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report. Our Credit Agreement matures on February 19, 2023, and we expect to repay the $80.0 million\nbalance outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility. While we may enter into a new credit agreement in the future,\nwe currently have no other committed sources of financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on\nterms favorable to us, if at all. See the risk factor below titled “ We may require additional capital to meet our\nfinancial obligations and support planned business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms or at all. ”\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. However, if we\nfail to comply with the covenants, make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo any other event\nof default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which would give it the\nright to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the Agent would have the\nright to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If the outstanding\ndebt under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient\nassets to repay it, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWhen we borrowed pursuant to the Term Loan A Facility, we chose a variable interest rate based on the one-month\nU.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate.\nIf we borrow pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, we are permitted to choose LIBOR as the benchmark for\nestablishing the applicable interest rate as well. LIBOR, which is calculated and published for various currencies\nand periods by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), is in the process of being phased out. The IBA has\nceased publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and intends to cease publication of\nall other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (including the one-month setting) after June 30, 2023. Accordingly, in the\nnear future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate. The current and any future reforms and\nother pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past,\nincluding during the transition period. Although our Credit Agreement will mature in February 2023 (before the\ncessation of the publication of the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR setting), the consequences of the LIBOR\ndevelopments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the value of our LIBOR-linked\nfinancial obligations, such as an increase in the cost of our Credit Agreement indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming\nplatform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the\nhiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic\nconditions.\n32\nTable o f Contents\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nOur Credit Agreement matures on February 19, 2023. While we may enter into a new credit agreement in the future, we\ncurrently have no other committed sources of financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on\nterms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory\nto us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business\nchallenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,\nand other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card\ninformation, user video and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential\ninformation. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of such information. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry\nstandards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of personal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security\nsafeguards as part of an information security program, and limits on the use or cross-border transfer of such\npersonal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our business partners, our\nusers, and other relevant stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and potential\nusers.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and user video\nand audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or\ncould have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential\ninformation. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their\nresponsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of\nthird parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex. While all\ninformation technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches,\nincidents, attacks, and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our information\ntechnology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems, make such\nsystems vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal, and external threats on our technology environment.\nVulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors,\nbusiness partners, or by malicious third parties.\nFor example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have experienced,\nand remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, and improper employee\naccess of confidential data. Malicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence,\nsophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a\nwide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized\ncriminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting\ngeopolitical conflict also have increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations\nglobally, including for companies headquartered in the United States.\nMost of our employees now have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols and offer work-issued devices to employees, the actions of\nour employees while working from home may have a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we\nprocess, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from\nemployees’ combined use of personal and private devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that\nwe do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\n33\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or\nintellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the\nnature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our\nsystems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,\ncontent publishers’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our\ndata (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or\nintellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or\nservices in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to\nprotect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the\nthreat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our\ncybersecurity.\nRecent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks,\nwith increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and\nmethodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may impact our\nability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors experience an\noutage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally, our third-party\nvendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such third parties\nfor use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be\naffected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open source software, which may be incorporated into our\nsystems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which we are not\naware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. For example, the Apache Log4j vulnerability discovered in\nDecember 2021 can be exploited by remote code execution, which can allow a bad actor to steal data or take over our\nsystems. We have taken steps to patch this vulnerability by updating our relevant Apache software, but we, and the\nmany other affected organizations, remain vulnerable in light of the widespread use of the Apache Log4j library and\ndifficulty in identifying all instances of this library across an entire enterprise. We cannot assure you that we\nwill not be impacted by this or other similar vulnerabilities in the future.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that security incidents may not be covered by our insurance\npolicies, and not all aspects of a security incident may be covered even where coverage exists. Insurance policies\nwill also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security incident. Even where an incident is\ncovered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we\nmay be faced with in the wake of a security incident.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our platform, streaming devices,\nsmart home products, website, computer systems, or mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us\nto liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our reputation. Efforts\nto prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in our products are\nexpensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or vulnerabilities.\nSuch unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk\nof contractual damages, litigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of\nharm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings\nand as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial\nresources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other\nsimilar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\nforeign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our\nproduct development and our business operations.\n34\nTable o f Contents\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to\nsystems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that\nleads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal\ninformation regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable federal or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming,\ndistracting, and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require\nus to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations,\nand contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This\ncould result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm.\nFor example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties\nand related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment\nCard Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.\nPenalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities\nwithin the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our\nprivacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further\nsecurity incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer\nof sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims\nby third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents. Data protection laws around the world often require\n“reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation\nand application of those laws are often uncertain and evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security\nmeasures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security\nmeasures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be\nable to protect the information we maintain. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory\ncorrective action due to a data security incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result\nin substantial costs and reputational harm.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential\ninformation, which creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),\nother consumers, employees, job applicants and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect,\nprocess, transmit, and store personal or confidential information (including our users’ payment card data and video\nand audio recordings). We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad\nand may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service\nproviders and our business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related\ntechnologies, to help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and\npartners’ content to deliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our\npartners on our products.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully\nleverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be\nrestricted by a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our\nservice providers’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by\nadvertisers, content publishers, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws,\nregulations, and industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit\naccess to or storage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for\nadvertising) that is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of\na transmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection\nof information which is used for advertising purposes.\n35\nTable o f Contents\nAdditionally, certain device manufacturers or operating system providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and\nsimilar technologies, or otherwise restrict the collection of personal information through these or other tools,\nvia our applications. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our\nrevenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising\ncampaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and\nsecurity of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory\nenvironment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,\ncontent distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally.\nPrivacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”),\nstate attorneys general, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian\nnational data protection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that\nidentify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the\ninternet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and\nforeign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict\nindustry participants’ ability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of\nconsumer notice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For\nexample, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the\ncollection, storage, and use of personal information related to people located in the EU (or which is processed in\nthe context of EU operations) and places new data protection obligations and restrictions on organizations, and may\nrequire us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what we have already done.\nIn addition, in the wake of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted\na framework similar to the GDPR. The EU has recently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being\n“adequate” to receive EU personal data. We are monitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data\nprotection framework and the impact this may have on our business.\nWe will continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not\ncompliant with data protection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines\nand penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For\nexample, under the GDPR, fines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, as well as data\nprocessing restrictions, could be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Data protection laws\ncontinue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For example, Brazil’s\nGeneral Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) came into effect in August 2020. The LGPD bears many substantive similarities\nto the GDPR such as extra-territorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data transfer restrictions,\nand mandatory breach notification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a company’s annual revenue in\nBrazil.\nThe U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based\ndata privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider\nadditional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an\neffort to comply.\nFor example, effective October 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”)\nto require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to intake requests\nfrom consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Effective January 2020, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information, such as\nrights to access, and require deletion of, their personal information, opt out of the sale of their personal\ninformation, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides\nfor civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data\nbreach litigation. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which becomes effective on January 1, 2023 (with a\n“look-back” to January 1, 2022), builds on the CCPA and among other things, requires the establishment of a\ndedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy issues. In recent years, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah\nhave adopted laws introducing new privacy obligations for which we may need to take additional steps to comply.\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments\nto existing laws on our business. Among other things, such restrictions are likely to increase the number of users\nto whom we cannot serve targeted advertising, and are likely to restrict our ability to collect and process certain\ntypes of information deemed sensitive under these new laws. The Canadian province of Quebec has also recently\nenacted a data protection law, known as Bill 64, that may similarly restrict our data processing activities.\n36\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.\nAdditionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a\nsecurity breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause\nour users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United\nStates. However, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of data transfers to the United\nStates, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to\nthe United States. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be an\ninvalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues\nregarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. On March 25, 2022, the European\nCommission and U.S. government announced that an agreement in principle on a new framework for data transfers from\nthe EEA to the United States had been reached, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), and\nthat this new framework should address the concerns raised in the 2020 European Court of Justice decision. On\nDecember 13, 2022, the European Commission released its draft adequacy decision on the EU-U.S. DPF, which, once\nformally adopted, would recognize that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data\ntransferred from the EU to organizations certified under the EU-U.S. DPF. Additional steps will need to be taken to\nformally adopt and implement this framework, however, and we are not yet able to predict precisely when or the\ndegree to which it will provide a consistent mechanism for our data transfers between the two jurisdictions. In\naddition, in 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be\nincorporated into new and existing agreements by no later than December 27, 2022 in order to continue to lawfully\ntransfer personal information outside of the EEA. The United Kingdom published final versions of its own Model\nClauses in February 2022. Updating agreements to incorporate these new Model Clauses for the EEA and United Kingdom\nhas required, may in the future require, significant time and resources to implement, including through adjusting\nour operations, conducting requisite data transfer assessments, and revising our contracts. In addition, cloud\nservice providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny from EU regulators, which may\nlead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal information outside the EU,\nwhich may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate. We continue to assess the available regulatory\nguidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data Protection Authorities and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce on international data transfer compliance for companies, including guidance on specific supplementary\nmeasures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data sharing that may be deemed a cross-border\ntransfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our ability to continue to transfer personal\ninformation outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to increased scrutiny and\nliability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to\nconduct these transfers in the future.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter\nrequirements for certain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.\nMaintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect\nthat, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and\nenforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CPRA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will\nlead to increased operational and compliance costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary,\nmake changes to our operations, policies, and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-\nrelated legal obligations, or any compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement\nactions, litigation, contractual indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or\nothers. In addition to potential liability, these events could harm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so.\n37\nTable o f Contents\nMoreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, representatives,\nagents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and\ndocumentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state, and federal action if they\nare found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing\nlaws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase\nour cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service\nproviders and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku OS, streaming platform, smart home products,\nand computer systems. For example, our smart home product line is reliant on (among other things) the engineering\nand software development teams and information technology systems of the service providers we use to assist in the\ndesign, manufacture, and maintenance of those products. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer\nsystems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-\nbased or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we\nexercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that\nthey may experience. In the future, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting\nsystems to cloud computing services, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we\nare unable to manage such a transition effectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services,\noperational delays, or inefficiencies until the transition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any\nof our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on\nterms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor\nto another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In\naddition, fires, floods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications\nfailures, break-ins, and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely.\nAs we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could\nadversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully\ncover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these\nvendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform\nperformance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to\naccommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated\nchanges in technology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their\ncontinued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over\nnetwork operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as\nany decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic.\nAny material disruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\n38\nTable o f Contents\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by\nISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of\nwhich could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also offer consumers\nmultichannel video programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators\nhave an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of\nother companies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to\nprovide preferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our\nproducts and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent\nlitigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of\nour competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their\nsubstantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant\nmanagement time and divert management’s attention from our other business concerns. Uncertainties resulting from\nthe initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in\nthe marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or\nroyalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to\ngain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property\nlicenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the\nscope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us\nand our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual\nproperty; cease making, licensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties.\nFor example, we have in the past elected to develop and implement specific design changes to address potential\nrisks that certain products could otherwise become subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from\npatent infringement and other intellectual property claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In\naddition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to\nresolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.\n39\nTable o f Contents\nHowever, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop\nour intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our\nagreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach\nthat agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to\nobtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential\nproprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade\nsecrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or\nmisappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a\ntrade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result in substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim\nis unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign\ncountries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we\ndevelop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our\ncompetitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a\ncompetitive advantage in our market, which could harm our business.\nWe have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is\nno guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained\nwill be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. U.S. patent laws,\nand the scope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change\nto “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the\ndetermination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to\nprotect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our business.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. In particular, our actions to monitor\nand enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit versions of our products or products\nbearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace, which could divert sales from us,\ntarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have\nincorporated open source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of\ncertain open source software or compliance with open source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject\nto similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or our noncompliance\nwith the open source software license terms.\n40\nTable o f Contents\nAlthough we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open source software, these processes\nand procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many\nopen source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or\ntechnology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. In such event,\nwe could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar open source\nsoftware license terms to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in\norder to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products in\nthe event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could harm our business.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract\nmanufacturers, and suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to\ninfringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were\nto lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary\nliabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku TV partners often\ninvolve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there\nis a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to\nour technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually limited.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic uncertainties have in the past and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nGlobal economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including\nincreased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in\neconomic policy, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, and global supply chain constraints. Such macroeconomic\nuncertainties may continue for an extended period and have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely\nimpact, many aspects of our business.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic\nconsequences. While we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours and account activations at the beginning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, more recently, we believe this growth has declined. In 2022, global supply chain disruptions\nresulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices, and\nsome of our licensed Roku TV partners faced inventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales.\nOur business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both of which are\nsusceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as growing inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary\nfears, and economic uncertainty. Sustained or worsening inflation or an economic downturn may result in fewer\nconsumer purchases of our products or the products of our licensed Roku TV partners (which could impact our active\naccount growth) and reduced advertising spending (which could impact our monetization efforts). Some of our\nadvertising verticals have experienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted their product\navailability, which, together with inflation and other macroeconomic factors, have resulted in advertisers reducing\ntheir overall advertising spend. If this pullback in consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending\ncontinues, our future operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact our operational and financial performance\nremains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may\nnegatively affect our business and operating results.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and\nimpact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine), terrorist attack, medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other man-\nmade disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our business operations. Any of these business\ndisruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\n41\nTable o f Contents\nIn particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster.\nIn addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV\npartners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\nwildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,\nincreasing intensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power\noutages. Further, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.\nIf our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,\nour ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the\noperations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or\nother catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed\nRoku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a disaster or other catastrophic event and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,\namong others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation\nand regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations\ngoverning issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of\nproviders of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the\ninternet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing\nregulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing the reference design of TVs powered by Roku\nOS, we were required to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing,\nmanufacturing, marketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations\nregarding the manufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and we or our licensed Roku TV\npartners may be unable to sell TVs powered by Roku OS at all, which could harm our business and our ability to grow\nour user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer\nprotection, children’s online protection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little\nharmonization between jurisdictions and limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and\nother government bodies that contain provisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and\nother tracking technologies to collect, use, and share user information. Certain state laws, such as the CCPA, the\nCPRA, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, also impose requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nhas laws requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from\nusers for the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In\naddition, the EU has adopted the Digital Services Act, which is legislation that updates the liability and safety\nrules for digital platforms, products, and services. If we or the third parties that we work with, such as contract\npayment processing services, content publishers, vendors, or developers, violate or are alleged to violate\napplicable privacy or security laws, industry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such\nviolations and alleged violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business\nand reputation and subject us to potential liability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers,\nor publishers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply\nwith these laws may subject us to liability and reputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npublishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).\nSome of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to\nactivities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties.\n42\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, the FTC has initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act\n(“COPPA”), which limits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children under\nthe age of 13. The review could result in broadening the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information\nthat are subject to these regulations. There have also been proposals in the U.S. Congress to amend and expand\nCOPPA. Changes to the COPPA legislation or rules could limit the information that we or our content publishers and\nadvertisers may collect and use and the content of advertisements in relation to certain channel partner content.\nThe CPRA and certain other state privacy laws also impose certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain\ninformation about minors can be collected.\nThe EU and many of its member states, among other jurisdictions, also have rules that limit processing of personal\ndata, including children’s data, and that impose specific requirements intended to protect children online. We and\nour content publishers and advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other\nprivacy, advertising, children’s online protection, or similar laws.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. Additionally, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United\nStates and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus, and the United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take\nother actions should the conflict further escalate. These and other geopolitical tensions and trade disputes can\ndisrupt supply chains and increase the cost of our products and the components required to manufacture our\nproducts, as well as costs for our licensed Roku TV partners. This could cause our products and those of our\nlicensed Roku TV partners to be more expensive for consumers, which could reduce the demand for or attractiveness\nof such products. In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to\nconduct business operations in that region. Beyond tariffs and sanctions, countries also could adopt other\nmeasures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our\noperations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of\nrestrictions could be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the\nadverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also\ncould have a negative impact on consumer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future\ngrowth. In particular, given the general deterioration in U.S.-China relations and ongoing tensions on trade,\nsecurity, and human rights, additional U.S. sanctions, tariffs, and export or import restrictions, as well as\nChinese sanctions or retaliatory measures, remain a serious risk.\nWe cannot predict whether new international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing trade agreements\nrenegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the Biden Administration with other U.S.\ntrading partners; or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry\nor our business or licensees. If any new legislation or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade\nagreements are renegotiated or terminated, or if tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be\ninefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes,\nand higher prices could depress consumer demand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.\n43\nTable o f Contents\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and\nsanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within\nour complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our\nretailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls relating to such\ncompliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all\ntimes or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our\nretailers or partners. Any such potential violation could have negative consequences, including government\ninvestigations or penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.\nIn addition, the effects of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU have been and are expected to continue to be\nfar-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic\nconditions. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people\nbetween the United Kingdom and the EU, and some disruptions have already occurred. Brexit could also lead to legal\nuncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws\nto replace or replicate.\nAlthough the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on the EU-UK post-Brexit economic relationship took effect on\nJanuary 1, 2021, it is incomplete, and the full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given these possibilities and\nothers we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.\nU.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade\nusers’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the\nprovision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Laws, regulations, or court\nrulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including decisions that undermine\nopen and neutrally administered internet access, or that disincentivize internet access network operators’\nwillingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their equipment, could decrease customer demand for our\nservice offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our\nbusiness model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations governing the provision of internet access service.\nSubstantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in 2015,\nthe FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content\npartners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules. More recently, the Biden Administration signed an\nexecutive order encouraging the FCC to readopt comprehensive open internet rules. The FCC therefore could consider\nadopting additional or modified rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for data and services. If network operators were to engage in restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, any of\nwhich could harm our business. Several states and foreign countries in which we operate also have adopted or are\nconsidering rules governing the provision of internet access.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or\napplications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce\nDirective in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The\nDMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to\nuncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that\nlimit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content\nmoderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit\nour ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n44\nTable o f Contents\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform.\nWhile our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the\ncopyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in\ncertain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted\ncontent. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our\nability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are\nunable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is\nunable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The\nNasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and\nmanagement resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is difficult to\npredict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm\nour business.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our\nnoncompliance, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\n45\nTable o f Contents\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, and\nproceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nway that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government\nentities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees, may require us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other\npenalties or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation,\nand require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31, 2022, Mr.\nWood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only\nowns 12.4% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our\n“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably\nbelieves to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.\nWood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely\nthis concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not\nsupport. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common\nstock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n46\nTable o f Contents\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class\nA common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content publishers;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or\npublic health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn addition, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation or derivative litigation. For example, a stockholder previously filed a\nderivative lawsuit (which has been dismissed), purportedly on our behalf, against certain members of our Board and\nmanagement in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our\nmanagement’s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,\nat the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent\nworkers may also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is\ndilutive to existing stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\n47\nTable o f Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or\nissues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or\nmore equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail\nto comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against\nus, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, on\ncommittees of our Board, or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our outstanding Credit Agreement contains prohibitions\non the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A\ncommon stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;\npermitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\n48\nTable o f Contents\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business."

                "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2021 and\n2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2021 filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022.\nOverview\nEffective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we reorganized our reportable segments to better align with\nmanagement’s reporting of information reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for each segment. We\nrenamed our “player” segment to “devices” which now includes our licensing arrangements with service operators and\nlicensed Roku TV partners in addition to sales of our streaming players, audio products, smart home products and\nRoku-branded TVs that will be designed, made, and sold by us in 2023. Our historical segment information is recast\nto conform to our new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report.\nOur two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising and related services including the demand-side platform and content distribution\nservices such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the\nsale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products, and,\nbeginning in 2023, Roku-branded TVs, and related accessories as well as from licensing arrangements with service\noperators and licensed Roku TV partners. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices (“ASP”) of Roku\nstreaming devices to increase our active accounts. We expect that the trade off from devices gross profit or loss\nto grow active accounts will result in increased platform revenue and platform gross profit.\nBusiness Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit\nmarket fluctuations, changes in economic policy, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain constraints,\nand geopolitical developments (such as the war in Ukraine), have had, and we believe will continue to have, an\nimpact on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2022, some of our licensed Roku TV partners faced\ninventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales. In addition, some of our advertising verticals\nexperienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted their product availability, which, together with\ninflation and other macroeconomic factors, have resulted in advertisers in a variety of industries reducing their\noverall advertising spend, which has adversely affected our platform revenue. We believe rising inflation and\nrecessionary fears also have led to a reduction in consumer discretionary spending, which has driven a decrease in\nour devices revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, although to a lesser extent than in\nthe past. The ongoing effects of the pandemic and associated economic conditions remain difficult to predict due to\nnumerous uncertainties. We believe that the direct and indirect impacts of these business conditions and\nmacroeconomic factors are difficult to isolate or quantify. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding\nForward Looking Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details.\n52\nTable o f Contents\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, active accounts, streaming hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nactive accounts as they stream content on our platform. All of our gross profit is generated from our platform\nsegment.\nOur gross profit was $1,441.1 million and $1,408.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, reflecting an increase of 2%.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nactive accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. Additionally, users who only register an account for use of one of our smart home products are not\nincluded in our reported number of active accounts. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the\nnumber of unique individuals who actively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an\naccount. For example, a single account may be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account\nmay be used on multiple streaming devices.\nWe had 70.0 million and 60.1 million active accounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively reflecting an\nincrease of 16%.\nStreaming Hours\nWe believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices\nstream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku platforms are\nnot included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our streaming hours. We report\nstreaming hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content publishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming\nhours does not correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis.\nMoreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a streaming device is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming channel\nmay continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also\noccurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to\nidentify when content has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user\ninteraction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm\nthat they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond\naffirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our\ncustomers, channel partners, and advertisers. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have\nimplemented similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature supplements these channel features. This\nfeature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nWe streamed 87.4 billion and 73.2 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\nreflecting an increase of 19%.\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $41.68 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $40.67 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of\n2%.\n53\nTable o f Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from digital advertising sales and related services including our demand-side ad\nplatform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue sharing arrangements, media\nand entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons\non remote controls. Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku Channel, native\ndisplay ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well as ad inventory we obtain through our content distribution\nagreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-sell video inventory that we purchase from content\npublishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party inventory on a revenue share basis. To date, we have\ngenerated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nDevices Revenue\nWe generate devices revenue from the sale of streaming players and other devices such as audio products, smart home\nproducts and accessories through consumer retail distribution channels and online retailers. Our devices revenue\nalso includes licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners. We generate most of our\ndevices revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily sell our devices through wholesale\ndistributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Revenue, Platform\nCost of revenue, platform primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory and\namortization costs of content, both licensed and produced, and revenue share with content publishers. Cost of\nrevenue, platform also includes other costs such as payment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the\ndelivery of our services that primarily include costs of third-party cloud services and salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our customer support and platform operations personnel, and amortization of acquired\ndeveloped technology.\nCost of Revenue, Devices\nCost of revenue, devices is comprised mostly of manufacturing costs payable to third party manufacturers for\ndevices we sell which include streaming players, audio products and smart home products. Cost of revenue, devices\nalso includes technology licenses or royalty fees on devices we sell or license, inbound and outbound freight, duty\nand logistics costs, third-party packaging, inventory provisions, and allocated overhead costs related to\nfacilities, customer support, and salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our development teams as well as outsourced development fees. In addition, research\nand development expenses include allocated facilities and overhead costs. We expect research and development\nexpenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and devices\nproducts and services.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits,\ncommissions, and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing,\ncommunications, data science and analytics, business development, product management, and partner support\nfunctions. Sales and marketing expenses also include marketing, retail and merchandising costs, and allocated\nfacilities and overhead expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future\nperiods as we focus on growing active accounts, platform and devices revenue, and expanding our business\ninternationally.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\nfinance, legal, information technology, human resources, and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting, and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility and overhead expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute\ndollars due to the expansion of our business and related infrastructure.\n54\nTable o f Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on cash and\ncash equivalents, income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated with the delivery of services as\npart of a strategic commercial arrangement, i nter est expense that includes interest on our debt and amortization\nof deferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement, and transaction gains and losses. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, other income (expense), net also includes the change in the fair value of the strategic\ninvestment.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax expense (benefit) consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business and income taxes in the United States. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,\nincluding net operating losses primarily for the U.S. and any jurisdiction where we do not expect to realize their\nbenefits in the future. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022       2021       2020\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   87  %      82  %      70  %\nDevices                                                    13  %      18  %      30  %\nTotal net revenue                                         100  %     100  %     100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   38  %      30  %      28  %\nDevices                                                    16  %      19  %      27  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                      54  %      49  %      55  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                                                   49  %      52  %      42  %\nDevices                                                    -3  %      -1  %       3  %\nTotal gross profit                                         46  %      51  %      45  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                   25  %      17  %      20  %\nSales and marketing                                        27  %      16  %      17  %\nGeneral and administrative                                 11  %       9  %      10  %\nTotal operating expenses                                   63  %      42  %      47  %\nIncome (Loss) from Operations                             -17  %       9  %      -2  %\nOther Income (Expense), Net:\nInterest expense                                            —  %       —  %       —  %\nOther income (expense), net                                 1  %       —  %       —  %\nTotal other income (expense), net                           1  %       —  %       —  %\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes                         -16  %       9  %      -2  %\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                                —  %       —  %       —  %\nNet Income (Loss)                                         -16  %       9  %      -2  %\n55\nTable o f Contents\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nNet Revenue\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2022            2021       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 2,711,441    $  2,264,920    $   446,521          20  %\nDevices                                                   415,093         499,664        -84,571         -17  %\nTotal net revenue                     $                 3,126,534    $  2,764,584    $   361,950          13  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $446.5 million, or 20%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to higher advertising revenue which includes revenue from our\ndemand-side ad platform as well as higher content distribution services, including higher revenue from media and\nentertainment promotional spending and Premium Subscriptions.\nDevices\nDevices revenue decreased by $84.6 million, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in both the volume of streaming players sold and average\nselling prices. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the volume of streaming players sold decreased by 14% and\nthe average selling price of streaming players decreased by 5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We\nbelieve the decrease in the volume of streaming players sold is due to a reduction in consumer discretionary spend\nas a result of inflationary pressures. The decrease in the average selling price is due to higher promotions during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 where the volume was aided by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and required fewer promotions. The slowdown in growth also impacted the revenue from sale of\naudio products and revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners which\nwas slightly offset by revenue from sale of accessories and smart home products.\nCost of Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of Revenue:                                             2022            2021       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 1,179,675    $    818,506    $   361,169          44  %\nDevices                                                   505,737         537,478        -31,741          -6  %\nTotal cost of revenue                 $                 1,685,412    $  1,355,984    $   329,428          24  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                              $                 1,531,766    $  1,446,414    $    85,352           6  %\nDevices                                                   -90,644         -37,814        -52,830         140  %\nTotal gross profit                    $                 1,441,122    $  1,408,600    $    32,522           2  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of revenue, platform increased by $361.2 million, or 44%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily driven by higher advertising inventory\ncosts, higher content amortization costs, Premium Subscription costs, and credit card processing fees all totaling\n$293.4 million. Platform costs increased an additional $67.3 million due to higher personnel costs and increases in\ncloud services costs for supporting the platform.\nGross profit for the platform segment increased by $85.4 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the overall growth in our platform revenue.\n56\nTable o f Contents\nDevices\nThe cost of revenue, devices decreased by $31.7 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower cost of revenue of $25.2 million due to\na decrease in the volume of streaming players sold, a decrease in royalty expenses of $6.2 million and a decrease\nin freight costs of $4.1 million, offset by an increase in inventory reserve, purchase commitment losses and\nreduction in supplier rebates totaling $5.7 million.\nGross loss for the devices segment increased by $52.8 million, or 140%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe the gross loss was driven by lower devices revenue due to\noverall decrease in consumer spending combined with disruptions in the global supply chain driving component prices\nhigher in 2022 as compared to 2021. We expect to incur negative gross margin in the devices segment in the near\nfuture as we continue to insulate consumers from price increases and incur costs from expected promotional\nactivities related to new product launches.\nOperating Expenses\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2022            2021       Change $    Change %\nResearch and development              $                   788,913    $    461,602    $   327,311          71  %\nSales and marketing                                       838,419         455,601        382,818          84  %\nGeneral and administrative                                344,678         256,297         88,381          34  %\nTotal operating expenses              $                 1,972,010    $  1,173,500    $   798,510          68  %\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $327.3 million, or 71%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $241.1 million as a result of increased engineering headcount and related stock-based compensation, an increase\nin facilities costs of $52.7 million due to expansion of office spaces and IT infrastructure, an increase of $19.6\nmillion related to restructuring charges, and higher consulting, professional services, and cloud services costs of\n$13.4 million.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $382.8 million, or 84%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $172.7 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation in sales and sales support,\nproduct management, marketing, and business analytics to support efforts to grow our business. Sales and marketing\nexpenses also include an increase of $160.0 million mainly due to increases in marketing, retail and merchandising\ncosts and general sales promotions, an increase in facilities costs of $20.9 million due to expansion of office\nspaces and IT infrastructure, an increase of $11.0 million in professional services and consulting fees, and an\nincrease of $10.9 million related to restructuring charges.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $88.4 million, or 34%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $72.5 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation, an increase in facilities\ncosts of $16.2 million due to expansion of office spaces and IT infrastructure, an increase of $7.6 million related\nto restructuring charges, a net increase of $4.6 million related to higher travel expenses, an increase in credit\nlosses and higher general overhead, offset by a decrease of $11.2 million related to lower legal expenses,\nconsulting, and professional services fees.\n57\nTable o f Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2022         2021       Change $    Change %\nInterest expense                      $                    -5,161    $  -2,980    $    -2,181          73  %\nOther income (expense), net                                43,766        4,467         39,299         880  %\nTotal other income (expense), net     $                    38,605    $   1,487    $    37,118              n/m\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net, increased by $37.1 million, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2021.

Less than 2% of our cash was held\noutside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign operations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue and proceeds from equity sales,\nincluding equity issued pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of\nrevenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party\nmanufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting\nand professional service fees, and facility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of\nproperty and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenses for facility and building related costs for our office locations in the\nUnited States and internationally. In addition, we expect to continue our investments in purchases of computer\nsystems and other property and equipment. We have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, such as\nthe acquisition of the Nielsen AVA business, the This Old House business, and content rights from Quibi in fiscal\n2021, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition activities in the future, including the acquisition of\nrights to programming and content assets. These activities can materially impact our liquidity and capital\nresources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet\nour working capital, capital expenditures, and material cash requirements from known contractual obligations for\nthe next twelve months and beyond. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows\nfrom operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed\nin Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the effects of the current macroeconomic environment.\nWhile the current macroeconomic environment has not severely impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date,\nit has contributed to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital and credit markets, which could\nadversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\n58\nTable o f Contents\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Our\nCredit Facility (described below) matures in February 2023, upon which we expect to pay off the remaining balance\nof $80.0 million. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be subject\nto fixed payment obligations and also to restrictive covenants. Additionally, due to the current macroeconomic\nenvironment, we may be unable to obtain debt financing on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn March 2, 2021, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc., and Evercore Group L.L.C., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we could offer and sell from time-\nto-time shares of our Class A common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $1,000.0 million. In March 2021,\nwe sold approximately 2.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average selling price of $379.26 per share,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of $1,000.0 million and incurred issuance costs of $10.4 million.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (as amended on\nMay 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan\nA facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\nFor our current borrowings, we have elected a Eurodollar borrowing with interest at a rate equal to the adjusted\none-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our secured leverage ratio. The borrowings under\nthe facility will be repaid in full in February 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by\nsubstantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, customary\naffirmative and negative covenants, a financial covenant that is tested quarterly and requires us to maintain a\ncertain adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, and customary events of default. As of December 31, 2022, we\nwere in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $37.7 million and $38.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon maturity of the Credit Facility, we expect to roll over\nthe outstanding letters of credit into a new, cash secured, bilateral facility. We expect this to require the use\nof approximately $44 million of existing cash and cash equivalents to secure the outstanding letters of credit.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2022            2021\nCash flows provided by operating           $                    11,795    $    228,081\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                  -201,696    $   -176,819\nCash flows provided by financing           $                     8,357    $  1,003,147\nactivities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our net loss of\n$498.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $700.1 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization of content assets, depreciation and amortization on property and\nequipment and intangible assets, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, and impairment of certain\nintangible technology assets adjusted by net gains on remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and\nliabilities.\nThe changes in our operating assets and liabilities used cash totaling $190.3 million mainly from an increase in\ncontent assets acquired and paid during the period, an increase in inventory on hand, an increase in prepaid\nexpenses and accounts receivable balances offset by inflows from an increase in accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities and an increase in deferred revenue balances. These changes are mainly due to overall growth in the\nbusiness combined with the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.\n59\nTable o f Contents\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 included cash outflows of $201.7 million consisting\nof purchases of property and equipment and expenditures related to the expansion of our office facilities of $161.7\nmillion and the purchase of a strategic investment of $40.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We received cash\nproceeds of $18.4 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These inflows were offset by $10.0 million\nof repayments made on borrowings.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 consisted of:\nPrincipal payments related to our Term Loan A Facility that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and\nthe related periodic interest payments. For additional information regarding the terms of the debt and interest\npayable, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to purchase finished goods from our manufacturers and other inventory related items. Consistent with\nindustry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with our\nmanufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders\nbased on projected demand information. Our manufacturers source components and build our products based on these\ndemand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our products may result in us being\ncommitted to purchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments. For additional information regarding\nmanufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual\nReport.\nCommitments to license content from content publishers and produce content under contractual arrangements. For\nadditional information regarding content commitments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item\n8 of this Annual Report.\nOperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and liabilities related to the\nlease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease liabilities, see\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.\nIn addition, we have $6.1 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. We adjust these positions\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. We are\nunable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. Although we believe we have\nadequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these\nmatters will not be materially different.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable\nat the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations requires significant\njudgment.\n60\nTable o f Contents\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation.\nFor performance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales.\nFor those performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that\nmay include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nTo the extent platform services are part of multiple element arrangements, revenue recognition of each performance\nobligation in the estimated transaction price of a contract is based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur devices revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price. The\nestimates for returns and sales incentives are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We\nprovide unspecified upgrades and updates to our devices end users. We record the allocated value of these as\ndeferred revenue and recognize it ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the\nassociated devices. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at\nfair value on the date of acquisition. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\nthe useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\nintangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and\noutflows, expected technology life cycle, attrition rates of customers, and discount rates. We estimate the useful\nlives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit\nfrom the asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately\nvalue assets and liabilities acquired, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to\nconsideration transferred, and the assets and liabilities acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to\nthe extent we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets and liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe identify intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determine their fair value. The determination\ninvolves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an\nasset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate discount rate. We amortize purchased-intangible\nassets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We review purchased-intangible assets\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally\nestimated, or that the carrying amount of the asset group to which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts\nand circumstances indicate an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of\npurchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset group\nagainst their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over\nthe fair value of these asset groups. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we\naccelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nAccounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales returns\nand sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical experience,\npromotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and\nsales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual results, the\nlosses or gains could be material.\n61\nTable o f Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and\nliability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation\nallowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance to offset the U.S. and Netherlands net deferred tax assets due to the\nuncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax\nassets. Our valuation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from the U.S.\nand Netherlands net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. In order to assess the likelihood that we will\nrecover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income, we review the level of positive and\nnegative evidence of future taxable income which is a critical estimate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2022 and those not yet adopted are\ndiscussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. They are\nincorporated herein by reference."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash, cash equivalents, and interest\nexpense on the Credit Facility. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while\nmaximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest\nrates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility totaled $80.0 million with an effective interest rate\nof 4.4%. If the amount outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility remains at this level for an entire year and\ninterest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease,\nrespectively, by an additional $0.8 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related\nto our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances and lease\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of\ncurrent and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not entered into any derivatives or\nother financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the\nfuture.\n62\nTable o f Contents"

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination of Content Distribution Services and Branded Channel\nButtons – Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content publishers, management is required\nto estimate variable consideration from transactional revenue sharing related to content distribution services and\nthe sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nVariable consideration related to content distribution services and sale of branded channel buttons on remote\ncontrols (“content publisher arrangements”) is included in the estimated transaction price based on the expected\nvalue for which a significant reversal of revenue is not expected to occur. For content distribution services, the\nestimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted\nperformance of the publisher’s applications. For the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls, the\nestimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted\nplayer sales volumes.\n64\nTable o f Contents\nWe identified the revenue forecasts relating to content publisher arrangements as a critical audit matter due to\nthe significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration. Such estimates required a high degree of\nauditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nestimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to content distribution\nservices and sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\n◦ Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\n◦ Analyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for transactional revenue sharing.\n◦ Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for content distribution services and sales of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\n◦ Tested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\n◦ Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\n◦ Tested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\n◦ We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to publishers’ content\napplications as well as our observations and inquiries as to the changes within the business and considerations of\nmacroeconomic and industry factors.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 16, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services\nincluding demand-side platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue\nshares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\nchannel buttons on remote controls. The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, audio\nproducts, smart home products and licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReorganization of Reportable Segments and Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nEffective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reorganized its reportable segments to better align\nwith management’s reporting of information reviewed by the CODM for each segment. The Company renamed the player\nsegment to the devices segment which now includes licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku\nTV partners in addition to sales of streaming players, audio products and smart home products. All financial\ninformation, current and historical, has been recast based on the reorganized segments to conform to the new\npresentation in the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 18 for additional details.\nIn addition to the prior period amounts related to segment reorganization discussed above, certain other prior\nperiod amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have also been reclassified to\nconform to the current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\nthe impairment of intangible assets;\namortization of content assets;\nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\nvaluation of strategic investments;\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 includes foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is equal to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n72\nTable o f Contents\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and\nliabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at exchange rates in\neffect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue\nand expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or\nlosses from remeasurement and transaction gains or losses are recorded as Other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $ 8.2million, loss of $\n1.2million, and gain of $ 1.3million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company also has some foreign subsidiaries which use local currency as their functional currency. The financial\nstatements of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Twofinancial institutions managed 26% and 21% of cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2022, and 30% and 27% as of December 31, 2021.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consisted of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nBeginning balance                    $                     6,015    $    5,912    $    6,550\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   19,068        16,181        14,594\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -17,666       -16,078       -15,232\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     7,417    $    6,015    $    5,912\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nBeginning balance                       $                    48,411    $   30,838    $   19,476\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                      94,731        90,530        68,315\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                       -114,239       -72,957       -56,953\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    28,903    $   48,411    $   30,838\n73\nTable o f Contents\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022         2021         2020\nBeginning balance                         $                     2,158    $   4,181    $   1,140\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2016-13                                   —            —        1,066\nAdjusted beginning balance                $                     2,158    $   4,181    $   2,206\nProvision for (recoveries of) doubtful                          2,081         -904        3,801\naccounts\nAdjustments for write-off                                        -741       -1,119       -1,826\nEnding balance                            $                     3,498    $   2,158    $   4,181\nThe Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net\nbalance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company determines whether a transaction meets the definition of a business combination before applying the\nacquisition method of accounting to that transaction. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase\nconsideration of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired businesses are\nincluded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations from their effective acquisition date. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and other related charges are recognized separately from the\nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is recognized\nat fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments\nto consideration transferred, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in\nconnection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and\nreevaluates these estimates and assumptions and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates with\na corresponding offset to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets acquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not\nlimited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In\nperforming its annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting\nunit’s goodwill for impairment or it can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s\nqualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is, more likely than not,\nless than its carrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s\ncarrying amount over its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit.\n74\nTable o f Contents\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes\nin business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be fully\nrecoverable or that the useful lives of the asset or asset group are no longer appropriate. The Company assesses\nthese asset or asset groups for impairment based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying\nvalue of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an\nimpairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill in any of the periods reported. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million related to the abandonment of future\ndevelopment of certain technology assets. This action was taken as part of the restructuring announced in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. See Note 15 for additional details. There were noimpairments of intangible\nassets during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nContent Assets\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as Content assets, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. For licensed content, the cost per title is capitalized along with a corresponding liability when the\nlicense period begins, the content is available for streaming and when the fee is determinable. For produced\ncontent, all direct production costs are capitalized. Payment terms for certain licensed content require advanced\npayments which are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage which results in\naccelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Projected usage is mainly based on\nestimated viewing trends. Amortization of content assets is included in Cost of revenue, platform in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nContent assets (licensed and produced) are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less than the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether\nthe film group is impaired. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets in any periods reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price of a contract based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales. For\nthose performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined based on market\nconditions and other observable inputs.\nWhen the Company sells third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the principal, and\nreports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, the Company\nconsiders if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as\nwell as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\n75\nTable o f Contents\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\ndemand-side ad platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue shares,\nmedia and entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and sale of branded channel\nbuttons on remote controls.\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies and to content\npublishers for their media and entertainment promotions via various campaign tools. Advertising arrangements\ninclude video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions. Advertising arrangements include\nmultiple performance obligations as they contain distinct advertising products or services. For such arrangements,\nthe Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company also\ngenerates revenue from customers using its ad platform. For such arrangements, it charges a platform fee, which is\na percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory spend during the month, along with data and any add-on features\npurchased through the platform. The Company recognizes revenue on either a gross or net basis for digital\nadvertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the principal in the revenue generation\nprocess or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to its customers\nfor the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Advertising arrangements comprised of\nmultiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of\nthe distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company’s content distribution revenue sharing arrangements include cash or non-cash consideration. The revenue\nsharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the\ntime of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is deemed to be the agent\nbetween content publishers and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, as the services\nare delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the form of advertising\ninventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party data.\nThe Company sells monthly subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded channel buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to\na publisher’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nDevices segment:\nThe Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products and\naccessories that are sold through retailers and distributors, as well as directly to customers through the\nCompany’s website. Effective as of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company renamed the segment from player to\ndevices which now also includes revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV\npartners.\nThe Company sells the majority of its devices in the U.S. through retailers and distributors as well as through the\nCompany’s website. Devices revenue primarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and\nupdates on a when and if-available basis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified\nupgrades and updates are available to customers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated\nvalue of the unspecified upgrades and updates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as devices revenue ratably on a\ntime elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the associated products.\nThe Company’s devices revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in devices revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\ndevices.\n76\nTable o f Contents\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to licensed Roku TV partners and service\noperators. The licensing revenue is recognized at a point in time, when the Company makes the intellectual property\navailable and the control transfers to the customer. The revenue allocated to unspecified upgrades and updates is\nrecognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period. Professional services revenue is recognized as\nservices are provided or accepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service\nperiod.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The\nCompany takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental\nborrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term,\nwhen it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between eighteen monthsand five years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from oneto eleven years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did notcapitalize any internal-use software costs. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company capitalized internal-use software development costs of $\n0.5million and $ 2.2million, respectively. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life of the asset, which is generally twoto three years, beginning when the asset is ready for its\nintended use. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company amortized expenses of $\n1.0million, $ 1.0million, and $ 0.5million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of devices revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, and advance payments from advertisers, content publishers,\nand licensing or services fees received from service operators and TV brands, where performance obligations are not\nyet fulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as a current liability and\nthe remaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\n77\nTable o f Contents\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses are recognized when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $ 10.0million, $ 35.2million,\nand $ 7.1million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted, in absence of its own\nhistorical exercise data.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatility of the Company’s\nClass A common stock price and the stock price volatilities of several peer companies which are similar in size and\noperational and economic activities.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of our stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with\nCustomers. ASU 2021-08 requires companies to apply Accounting Standards Codification, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (Topic 606) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with\ncustomers acquired in a business combination. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of\nTopic 848 . This guidance defers the sunset date for applying the reference rate reform relief in ASC 848 to\nDecember 31, 2024. The guidance is effective as of December 21, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The adoption did\nnot have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n78\nTable o f Contents\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue is represented by the tworeportable segments discussed in Note 18.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             760,793    $  752,393    $  523,852\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                    42,617        46,952         7,431\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                       87,678        45,760        55,465\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   28,210        28,726        21,283\nTotal deferred revenue                   $             115,888    $   74,486    $   76,748\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for sales returns, sales incentives,\nand doubtful accounts. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets decreased by $ 4.3million during the year\nended December 31, 2022 due to the timing of billing to customers and a slower growth rate in platform revenue.\nContract assets increased by $ 39.5million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in\nthe growth of platform revenue combined with the timing of billing which fell into a subsequent period.\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ 41.4million during the year ended December 31, 2022\nprimarily due to the billings in excess of revenue recognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations\nrelated to revenue arrangements. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $ 2.3million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 primarily due to the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to content\narrangements offset by an increase in deferred revenue from advertising arrangements due to growth in the platform\nbusiness and an increase in the deferral period of devices revenue for its unspecified upgrades.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2021 was $ 47.6million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $ 56.2million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 997.4million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 56% over the next 12months and the\nremainder thereafter.\nThe Company reversed $ 3.2million and recognized $ 28.6million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in the\nestimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nThe Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its total net revenue as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. Customer C accounted for 12% of total net revenue during the year ended December 31,\n2020.\n79\nTable o f Contents\n4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nNielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising Business\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement to purchase the Advanced Video\nAdvertising (“AVA”) business from Nielsen Holdings PLC (“Nielsen”). The AVA business consists primarily of video\nautomatic content recognition and dynamic ad insertion technologies. On April 15, 2021, the Company closed the\ntransaction, acquiring from Nielsen the AVA business, consisting of certain assets and liabilities and all of the\nequity interests in a subsidiary associated with the AVA business (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the\nAcquisition, the Company and Nielsen entered into a strategic commercial arrangement under which the parties will\nprovide certain advertising measurement solutions to each other. The Company acquired Nielsen’s AVA business to\naccelerate its launch of an end-to-end linear ad replacement solution and to further integrate Nielsen’s ad and\ncontent measurement products into the Company’s ad platform.\nThe total purchase consideration for Nielsen’s AVA business was $ 53.4million, which consisted of (i) $ 38.5million\npaid in cash and (ii) $ 21.4million of non-cash consideration related to obligations to deliver services to\nNielsen, offset by (iii) $ 6.5million of services to be received from Nielsen. The obligations to deliver services\nto Nielsen were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. The services to be delivered to\nNielsen are recognized within Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period. The services to be received from Nielsen represent contract terms that the Company entered into\nfor future goods and services that were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. These\nservices are recognized as Cost of revenue, platform in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period. The Company incurred $ 3.9million in acquisition-related expenses that were recorded in General\nand administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nbased on estimated fair values was as follows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired                                        Fair Values\nCash and cash equivalents                           $        3,057\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                       85\nProperty and equipment, net                                    584\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped technology                                        11,000\nIPR&D technology                                             7,500\nGoodwill                                                    36,790\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                          1,235\nOther non-current assets                                     1,905\nTotal assets acquired                                       62,156\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities                    -1,168\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current portion              -830\nOther long-term liabilities                                 -6,767\nTotal liabilities assumed                                   -8,765\nTotal purchase consideration                        $       53,391\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, intangible assets, and liabilities assumed was\nrecorded as goodwill. Goodwill was primarily attributable to expected synergies in advertising offerings and cross-\nselling opportunities. The majority of the goodwill recorded was deductible for tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the developed technology was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. The key valuation\nassumptions included the Company’s estimates of expected future earnings and royalty rate. The Company amortizes\nthe fair value of the developed technology on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The fair value\nof the in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) technology was estimated using the multi-period-excess-\nearnings method. The key valuation assumptions included the Company’s estimates of expected future revenue and\nmargin.\n80\nTable o f Contents\nThe valuation of the intangible assets acquired from Nielsen’s AVA business along with their estimated useful\nlives, were as follows (in thousands, except years):\nEstimated Weighted-Average Useful Lives\nEstimated Fair Value    (in years)\nDeveloped technology                $                11,000                                             5.9\nIPR&D technology                                      7,500\nEstimated fair value of acquired    $                18,500                                             5.9\nintangible assets\nThis Old House\nOn March 19, 2021, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of TOH Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“This Old\nHouse”), a home improvement media business, according to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company acquired the This Old House business because the Company believed the content aligned with The Roku\nChannel’s ad-supported growth strategy.\nThe total purchase consideration for This Old House was $ 97.8million, paid entirely in cash.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT\nIn June 2022, the Company agreed to provide financing of up to $ 60.0million in the aggregate to a counterparty\nwith whom the Company has a commercial relationship, of which $ 40.0million was advanced in the form of convertible\npromissory notes (the “Strategic Investment”) and is recognized in Other non-current assets on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Strategic Investment accrues interest at 5% per annum and has a maturity date of June 15, 2025,\nor is due upon a redemption event or in the event of a default.\nThe Strategic Investment contains certain redemption features that meet the definition of embedded derivatives and\nrequire bifurcation. The Company elected to apply the fair value option and account for the hybrid instrument\ncontaining the host contract and the embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument, with any subsequent\nchanges in fair value included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents including restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $\n608.4million and $ 1,015.9million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, using Level 1\ninputs.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company measured the Strategic Investment using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the\nStrategic Investment on the date of purchase was determined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company\nrecorded an unrealized loss of $ 0.5million in Other income (expense), net related to the adjustment to fair value\nof the Strategic Investment for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2021.\n86\nTable o f Contents\nThe Company classified the Strategic Investment as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over\nfair value inputs. The fair value of the Strategic Investment was estimated using a scenario-based probability\nweighted discounted cash flow model. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and\nprobability weighting of the various redemption scenarios that impact the settlement of the Strategic Investment.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\n10. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate.

(as\namended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a four-yearrevolving credit facility in the\naggregate principal amount of up to $ 100.0million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-yeardelayed draw\nterm loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100.0million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and\n(iii) an uncommitted incremental facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial and other conditions,\nin the amount of up to (v) $ 50.0million, plus (w) 1.0x of the Company’s EBITDA for the most recently completed\nfour fiscal quarter period, plus (x) an additional amount at the Company’s discretion, so long as, on a pro forma\nbasis at the time of incurrence, the Company’s secured leverage ratio does not exceed 1.50to 1.00, plus (y)\nvoluntary prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility to the extent accompanied by\nconcurrent reductions to the applicable Credit Facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term\nLoan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\nOn November 18, 2019, the Company borrowed the Term Loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of $\n100.0million. In March 2020, the Company borrowed the available balance of $ 69.3million from the Revolving Credit\nFacility. For both borrowings, the Company elected an interest rate equal to the adjusted one-month LIBOR rate plus\nan applicable margin of 1.75% based on the Company’s secured leverage ratio.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.\nIn order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and\nsuppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-\ncancelable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 169.7million of non-cancelable purchase commitments for\ninventory.\nContent Commitments\nThe Company enters into contracts with content publishers to license and produce content for streaming. When a\ntitle becomes available, the Company records a content asset and liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain licensing agreements, such as film output deals, include the obligation to license rights for unknown\nfuture titles for which the ultimate quantity and/or fees are not determinable as of the reporting date. The\nCompany does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. The\nunknown obligations could be material.\n91\nTable o f Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total obligation for licensed and produced content is $ 393.1million, of\nwhich the Company recorded $ 94.6million in Current liabilities and $ 39.6million in Other long-term liabilities in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The remaining $ 258.9million is not yet recognized on the consolidated balance\nsheets as the content does not meet the criteria for asset recognition.\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,\n2023                            230,756\n2024                            111,158\n2025                             35,394\n2026                             10,532\n2027                              1,838\nThereafter                        3,429\nTotal content liabilities    $  393,107\nThe Company also licenses content under arrangements where the payments are variable and based on the revenue\nearned by the Company. Since those amounts cannot be determined as of December 31, 2022, they are not included in\nthe obligations above.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $\n37.7million and $ 38.0million, respectively, related to facilities leases. The letters of credit have various\nexpiration dates through 2030.\nContingencies\nThe Company accrues for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing claims, when\nit believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. These contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly\nand adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel,\nand other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal proceedings can be,\nhowever, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course\nof business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices, and patent infringement. The\nCompany is involved in litigation matters not listed herein. Although the results of these proceedings, claims, and\ninvestigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final outcome of any\nmatters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, the Company did\nnot have any loss contingencies that were material. During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company recorded\nexpenses of $ 4.8million in Cost of revenue, device, $ 1.8million in Cost of revenue, platform, and $ 3.4million in\nGeneral and administrative expenses for claims related to patent infringement.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n92\nTable o f Contents\n14.

As a result, the Company has recorded\nadditional U.S. income tax expense of $ 3.0million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized through future operations. As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2022, management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a\nfull valuation allowance against its U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 199.2million and $ 261.8million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe change in the valuation allowance, during the year ended December 31, 2022, is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in deferred tax assets generated through capitalization of section 174 research and development expenses\nfor U.S. federal and conforming state purposes. The change in the valuation allowance during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to an increase in domestic net operating loss carryforwards primarily\ndue to stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of approximately $ 46.2million in deferred tax assets that\nare not realizable, related to the intellectual property transfer completed during 2021, giving rise to foreign\namortizable assets.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,959.1million and $ 1,677.7million are available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2033 for federal and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2022.\nFor Brazil, Denmark, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n8.0million, $ 1.6million, $ 23.5million, and $ 26.2million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable\nincome, if any, in those countries. Brazil, Denmark, and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward\nindefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be carried back one year and carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 188.7million and $\n134.7million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and 2035, respectively.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 is $ 88.0million, of which $ 71.3million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 16.7million is related to international activities.\n94\nTable o f Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022         2021\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              66,150    $  29,175\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        22,888       36,198\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                     -317         -330\nGross increase for tax positions of                           676        1,107\nprior years\nGross decrease for tax positions of                        -1,185            —\nprior years\nDecrease relating settlements with                           -184            —\ntaxing authorities\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              88,028    $  66,150\nof year\nAs of December 31, 2022, $ 5.3million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect\nthe effective tax rate and, $ 82.7million would result in an adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding\nadjustments to the valuation allowance. We do not expect our gross unrecognized tax benefits to change\nsignificantly within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. The Company recorded $ 0.8million and $ 0.3million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. All tax\nyears remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits include questioning the timing\nand amount of deductions; the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; and compliance with federal, state,\nand local tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,\nthe Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes,\nstate income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of\nunrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n15. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nIn November 2022, the Company approved a plan to reduce its operating expense growth rate due to economic\nconditions. The Company eliminated employee positions in the United States and internationally, and also abandoned\nfuture development for certain technology assets. Accordingly, the Company recorded employee termination expenses\nconsisting primarily of severance payments, notice pay (where applicable), employee benefits contributions, payroll\ntaxes and related costs, and an impairment charge related to the abandoned technology assets.\nThe restructuring charges are recorded as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December\n31, 2022\nEmployee Terminations       Impairment Charge        Total\nResearch and development       $                 12,092    $              7,500    $  19,592\nSales and marketing                              10,904                       —       10,904\nGeneral and administrative                        7,644                       —        7,644\nTotal restructuring charges    $                 30,640    $              7,500    $  38,140\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of employee termination restructuring charges, which are\nincluded in Accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, is as follows (in thousands):\nEmployee Terminations\nBalance as of December 31, 2021                                      —\nEmployee termination restructuring charges                      30,640\nincurred\nCash payments                                                   -8,547\nBalance as of December 31, 2022               $                 22,093\nThe Company expects the plan to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2023.\n95\nTable o f Contents\n16. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. Nocontributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan in the U.K. for its U.K.-based employees. The Company contributed $\n2.3million, $ 1.3million, and $ 0.7million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively.\n17. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to\ncalculate net income (loss) per share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and\nas otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by\napplicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic\nand diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, options to purchase common stock and\nrestricted stock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by\napplying the treasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per\nshare in the period of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as follows (in\nthousands, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                          2022                   2021                   2020\nNet income (loss)            $                  -498,005             $  242,385             $  -17,507\nDenominator:\nBasic net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    137,668                132,710                123,978\noutstanding — basic\nNet income (loss) per        $                     -3.62             $     1.83             $    -0.14\nshare — basic\nDiluted net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    137,668                132,710                123,978\noutstanding — basic\nEffect of potentially\ndilutive\nsecurities:\nRestricted stock units                                 —                  2,744                      —\nStock options                                          —                  6,214                      —\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    137,668                141,668                123,978\noutstanding — diluted\nNet income (loss) per        $                     -3.62             $     1.71             $    -0.14\nshare — diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because of their\nanti-dilutive effect were 14.4million, 1.1million and 13.1million units of equity awards to purchase common stock\ngranted under our equity plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n96\nTable o f Contents\n18. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the CODM for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\nThe Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates performance and makes decisions about\nallocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis and\non revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the management approach to determine the\nsegment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented separately in the Company’s notes to its\nconsolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized\nthe segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does not\nallocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nEffective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reorganized reportable segments to better align with\nmanagement’s reporting of information reviewed by the CODM for each segment. The Company’s segment and related\nfinancial information has been recast to reflect the following changes; the Company renamed the player segment to\nthe devices segment which now includes licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners\nin addition to sales of streaming players, audio products and smart home products. All financial information,\ncurrent and historical, has been recast based on the reorganized segments.\nUpdated descriptions of the Company’s tworeportable segments are as follows:\nPlatform\nThe platform segment generates revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\ndemand-side platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media\nand entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons\non remote controls.\nDevices\nThe devices segment generates revenue from the sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products and\naccessories that are sold through retailers and distributors, as well as directly to customers through the\nCompany’s website. In addition, revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV\npartners is now included in the devices segment.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022       2021       2020\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                            *      10  %      14  %\nDevices segment revenue\nCustomer A                                            *          *      10  %\nCustomer B                                        21  %      22  %      17  %\nCustomer C                                        38  %      35  %      39  %\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.\nLong-lived assets, net\nThe following table presents long-lived assets, net, which consist primarily of property and equipment and\noperating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022          2021\nUnited States      $             686,902    $  442,012\nUnited Kingdom                   127,538        59,168\nOther countries                   42,286        22,047\nTotal              $             856,726    $  523,227\n97\nTable o f Contents"

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as\nof the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and\noperation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nbelow.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n98\nTable o f Contents\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 16, 2023"

                "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States by\nhours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV. We believe that all TV will be streamed. The shift of the TV ecosystem to\nstreaming continues and is expanding TV’s capabilities for viewers, content partners, advertisers, and other\nindustry participants. Nearly every major media company not only has a streaming service, but has also expanded\nbeyond pure subscription streaming models to new ad-supported streaming options. Advertisers use TV streaming to\nreach viewers who are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV while also benefiting from the digital advertising\ncapabilities that TV streaming platforms can deliver.\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nviewers, content partners, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we connect viewers to the\nentertainment they love; enable content partners to build, engage, and monetize large audiences; and provide\nadvertisers with unique capabilities to reach viewers.\nOur Strategy and Business Model\nThe foundation of our platform is the Roku operating system (the “Roku OS”), which is purpose built for TV\nstreaming, and powers Roku streaming devices. The Roku OS is designed to run on low-cost hardware, which enables\nRoku streaming devices to be sold to customers at competitive prices. The Roku OS connects viewers to our streaming\nplatform via a broadband network, giving them access to a wide selection of content through a streaming experience\nthat is both delightful and easy to use. We provide updates via the Roku OS to continuously deliver an exceptional\nTV streaming experience.\nWe dedicate significant resources to build, maintain, and advance the Roku OS; to provide an industry-leading\nstreaming platform for our viewers, content partners, and advertisers; to obtain content for our streaming platform\nthat attracts viewers, including our own original programming (Roku Originals); and to extend Roku’s leadership as\nthe global shift to TV streaming continues.\nOur three-phased business model—grow scale, grow engagement, and grow monetization—drives our mission as a global\nstreaming platform that connects and benefits the TV ecosystem of viewers, content partners, and advertisers. We\nleverage our ownership of our streaming platform to help our viewers find content across the streaming universe,\nwhile simultaneously growing monetization.\nScale: Increasing the number of Active Accounts\nWe make access to TV streaming affordable through a broad lineup of devices, at a variety of competitive price\npoints, including Roku TV models, Roku-branded TVs, and Roku streaming players.\nRoku TV models are TVs made and sold by our Roku TV partners, which are TV original equipment manufacturers\n(“OEMs”) that license the Roku OS and leverage our smart TV reference designs. We have driven strong Active Account\ngrowth through our Roku TV licensing program, which we launched 10 years ago.\nIn 2023, we launched Roku-branded TVs, which are designed, made, and sold by us. The Roku Select and Roku Plus\nSeries TVs are available at Best Buy, Amazon, and Costco in the United States, and the Roku Pro Series TV is\nexpected to be available in spring 2024. Roku-branded TVs complement our successful Roku TV licensing program. We\nbelieve our Roku-branded TVs will enable us to further grow our leadership position in TV streaming and expand into\nthe higher-end range of performance TVs. Roku-branded TVs will also help us innovate more quickly in all aspects of\nhardware and software and test directly with viewers, improving the product and viewer experience and strengthening\nthe entire Roku ecosystem.\nRoku streaming players enable users to easily turn (nearly) any TV into a smart TV. On a periodic basis, we launch\nnew streaming player models with a focus on offering high performance at an affordable price.\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telecommunications service operators that distribute co-branded\nstreaming players to their subscribers in their markets.\n5\nTable of Contents\nThe Roku ecosystem extends beyond TV streaming to smart home devices that include cameras, video doorbells, a home\nmonitoring system, plugs, light bulbs, and light strips, along with our Roku Smart Home mobile application for iOS\nand Android. Similar to our TV streaming business model, we build scale by selling Roku Smart Home devices and then\nmonetize through smart home services. We offer subscription plans for our cameras, video doorbells, and home\nmonitoring system.\nAudio is an important part of the TV streaming experience, and we also offer Roku-branded wireless speakers and\nsubwoofers that seamlessly connect to TVs powered by the Roku OS.\nThrough our streaming devices and the Roku platform, we provide viewers tremendous choice, value, and an\nexceptional viewer experience. In 2023, we added 10.0 million net Active Accounts, ending the year with 80.0\nmillion Active Accounts.\nEngagement: Growing Streaming Hours\nWe believe that offering viewers a wide range of content and an easy-to-use interface drives increased user\nengagement. We grew Streaming Hours from 87.4 billion hours in 2022 to 106.0 billion hours in 2023 through the\nincreased distribution of Roku streaming devices, increasing our Active Accounts, and continuing to enhance our\nviewer experience.\nOne of the key competitive advantages driving our success is our position as a TV streaming platform that has\nachieved significant scale—our home screen is the first thing our viewers see when they start their TV streaming\njourney. From this position, we can help the viewer decide what to watch across the vast range of options available\nto them on our streaming platform. We innovate and build features to support this critical role in the viewer’s\njourney, and it is a key driver of our monetization.\nThe Roku Home Screen Menu (left navigation bar) contains features such as Live TV, Sports, and What to Watch, and\nin 2023 we launched enhancements to make it even easier for viewers to find and discover great entertainment. For\nexample, we are enabling more personalization through recommendations and features that allow viewers to track TV\nshows, movies, and sports teams. Additionally, Roku’s powerful universal search makes it fast and easy when viewers\nare looking for specific content.\nWe also empower viewers to choose how much they want to spend on content by offering them a broad array of ad-\nsupported, subscription, and transactional options. Our direct relationship with customers provides us with\ndetailed insights about their behavior on our streaming platform, including certain content viewers search for, the\napps viewers install and watch, and the types of content that viewers purchase or subscribe to on our platform.\nThis first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content recommendations to improve our\nviewers’ experience.\nOur significant scale, ability to reach highly engaged viewers, tools that enable seamless sign ups, and\nmarketing/discovery features make us an attractive platform to content partners. They can also reach and engage\nthose viewers who no longer use or never used traditional TV services. As more viewers shift to TV streaming,\ncontent partners that publish apps on our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage\nviewers directly.\nOne of the key engagement drivers on our streaming platform is The Roku Channel, our owned and operated streaming\napp. The Roku Channel aggregates a broad variety of entertainment into a unified streaming experience, through\nthree distinct types of content:\nAVOD (ad-supported video on demand): Users can stream a broad variety of 80,000+ movies and TV shows, including\nRoku Originals, for free.\nLive TV : Users have access to watch 400+ FAST (free, ad-supported linear streaming TV) channels.\nPremium Subscriptions : Users can easily sign up, view, and manage subscriptions to dozens of streaming services\nthat require a subscription such as Paramount+ and AMC+ with a single, monthly bill.\nThe Roku Channel benefits from its integration with our streaming platform, which has features such as Live TV,\nSports, What to Watch, and more that can surface content from The Roku Channel to our viewers directly from our\nhome screen and throughout a viewer’s streaming journey on our platform. In 2023, The Roku Channel was a top 5 app\non our platform by both Active Account reach and Streaming Hours.\nThe foundation of our content strategy for The Roku Channel is third party licensed content and, to a smaller\nextent, Roku Originals. Our content spend is intended to be commensurate with the growth trajectory of The Roku\nChannel and with the broader macroeconomic environment. The Roku Channel is available on devices powered by the\nRoku OS in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. In the United States, it is also available\nonline at TheRokuChannel.Roku.com, and on Amazon Fire TVs, Samsung TVs, Google TV, and other Android TV OS devices.\n6\nTable of Contents\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services), as well as streaming\nservices distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions,\nand the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls). Previously, we referred to streaming services distribution\nas content distribution services. Our TV streaming platform enables content partners and advertisers to reach\naudiences that are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV. Each user on our streaming platform creates multiple\nrevenue opportunities for Roku through activities such as navigating through the Roku home screen, watching ad-\nsupported content, or signing up for subscription services. We measure monetization of our platform by calculating\nthe average revenue per user (“ARPU”), which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model, and\ngross profit.\nWe make it easy for content partners to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary\nbusiness models: subscription video on demand (“SVOD”), which includes subscriptions to individual video on demand\napps and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution (“vMVPD”) services; ad-supported video,\nwhich includes ad-supported video on demand (“AVOD”) apps with on demand content that do not charge a subscription\nfee to users, as well as free ad-supported streaming TV (“FAST”), which we define as free, ad-supported linear\nstreaming TV; and transaction video on demand, which includes apps that offer a la carte content purchases or\nrentals. Through Roku Pay, our proprietary billing solution, we are also able to assist content partners with\nbilling services, including billing users for in-app purchases like content rentals, managing subscriptions, and\ncustomer invoices. Roku Pay allows content partners to enable a frictionless signup within their app, and we\nbelieve this key benefit simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for our content\npartners.\nContent partners also have access to our media and entertainment tools to help them attract, engage, and retain\nviewers by investing in promoting their content on our streaming platform. Content partners can use a variety of ad\nplacements, including native display ads on the Roku home screen or a screen saver to drive app downloads, promote\nan app’s content, and direct traffic to their apps in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show\nconsumption. We also derive revenue from the sale of branded app buttons on streaming player and Roku TV remote\ncontrols that are intended to increase incremental usage of an app by allowing viewers to launch straight into the\napp from any screen. Our analytics and reporting assist content partners with analyzing viewership trends and\nmetrics for specific titles, and we also can help content partners target new audiences that are more likely to\nsubscribe to their services.\nJust as ads evolved decades ago when TV replaced radio as the primary entertainment medium, ads on TV streaming\noffer new and more performant opportunities than traditional TV. We offer advertisers a unique and effective set of\ntools to reach viewers both on and off our streaming platform. Advertisers are able to leverage the combination of\nour significant scale, our direct relationship with viewers, and our advertising capabilities to serve relevant\nadvertisements. Advertisers on our platform also can measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their\nreturn on investment.\nWe are developing new and deeper relationships with third-party ad-buying platforms (retail media networks, demand-\nside platforms (“DSPs”), and other strategic partners) to meet marketers where they currently are buying\nprogrammatic advertising. At the same time, our specialized ad products (such as Shoppable Ads, the Kroger Shopper\nProgram, native ad formats, and our audience guarantees) are accessible only on our advertising platform. This\noverall approach protects our strategic assets, while creating additional demand opportunities for our ad\ninventory. Advertisers can use third-party DSPs or OneView (our ad-buying platform) to set up, make changes, and\nmeasure ad campaigns entirely on their own.\nWe offer engagement analytics such as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We\nwork with a wide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and\naudience demographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform.\nFurthermore, we have relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data,\nwhich enables our advertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on\ntraditional TV. Additional promotional advertising opportunities include content sponsorships that give viewers the\nopportunity to experience a free movie or show and sponsored themes in our viewer experience and shoppable ads that\nallow viewers to buy products directly from the TV screen. With shoppable ads, we are adding more performant tools\nand more partnerships to expand the capabilities we can offer advertisers.\nThe Roku Channel is also a core strategic asset in our monetization efforts that simultaneously benefits viewers,\ncontent partners, and advertisers, while generating increasing platform revenue. For viewers, The Roku Channel is a\ncompelling destination for a diverse selection of free and paid entertainment. For content partners, The Roku\nChannel provides a variety of options to distribute and monetize content through both licensing agreements and\nPremium Subscriptions. And for both content partners and advertisers, The Roku Channel delivers a large and engaged\naudience at scale that we believe will continue to grow. Owning and operating both The Roku Channel and the\nstreaming platform creates unique value, making us a leader in free content, positioning us to be a valuable\npartner to content partners, and providing a large source of ad inventory.\n7\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to further differentiate our streaming platform and increase the value we deliver\nto our viewers, content partners, and advertisers. We must regularly update and enhance our streaming platform to\nmeet evolving viewer behavior and provide a best-in-class content delivery and advertising platform. We must\nprovide content partners with best-in-class publishing tools and actionable audience insights. We must continue to\ninnovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental\nadvertising spend on our platform. We aim to balance our commitment to achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA for full\nyear 2024 and our investments to further expand our scale, engagement, and monetization.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe continue to innovate our advertising offerings. In 2023, for the first time, Roku City (our dynamic screen\nsaver) was opened for major advertisers in a broader range of verticals, such as McDonald’s, Mattel, and Carnival\nCruise Line, which have integrated brand-specific visuals into our iconic screen saver. We also announced a number\nof partnerships to expand the value we can deliver to marketers. For example, we partnered with DoorDash to allow\ntheir merchants to place click-to-order offers within their Roku ads, and with Instacart to help consumer-packaged\ngoods (CPG) advertisers measure whether users are purchasing products on Instacart after seeing an ad on our\nstreaming platform. Building on the Shoppable Ad technology that we launched with Walmart in 2022, we partnered\nwith Shopify to enable users to purchase products from Shopify merchants directly from Roku devices. And Spotify\npartnered with Roku as its first TV streaming partner to introduce video ads in the Spotify app on Roku devices.\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers viewers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to viewers, content\npartners, and advertisers is as compelling in international markets as it is in the United States. Today Roku\nstreaming devices are available in 15+ countries. We are the leading TV streaming platform in the United States and\nMexico by hours streamed.\nInternationally, we continue to grow our footprint and deepen our presence in key markets. In Mexico, we announced\nRCA as a new Roku TV partner, an 8K Roku TV model with TCL, and new Roku TV models with Philips. Building on our\nexpansion in Latin America, we announced Roku TV models with Caixun in Chile and the launch of RCA Roku TV models\nin Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In the United Kingdom, we announced Roku TV models\nwith JVC (at Currys stores), Polaroid, and Sharp. And in Germany, we expanded our Roku TV program with our third TV\nOEM partner, Coocaa. In international markets, we will continue to focus on building scale first, increasing\nengagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nWe are successfully growing The Roku Channel internationally. The Roku Channel is available on devices powered by\nthe Roku OS in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico has become the channel’s largest international\nmarket. With strong scale and engagement, and the launch of our digital advertising business in 2022, we have begun\nto monetize in Mexico.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously grow scale, engagement, and\nmonetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily\nfocused on building and expanding relationships with content partners, advertisers, TV brands, retailers, and\nservice operators, and driving sales of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products to consumers\nthrough retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships to promote and build awareness\nof the features and advantages of our streaming platform among content partners, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform\nto increase effectiveness for our content partners and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns.\nOur relationship with content partners is typically client-direct. Through our dedicated content partner\nrelationship management team, we enter into agreements with content partners to distribute their apps on our\nplatform, or license their content for The Roku Channel, or both. As part of our distribution agreements with AVOD\napps, we typically secure direct access to a portion of the content partners’ video ad inventory for our\nmonetization, and our sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content partners. Whereas\nour content partners typically feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large\nstreaming audience across many apps and via other Roku branded experiences such as our home screen at once using\nour own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their goals across numerous key\nperformance indicators.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe are developing relationships with more third-party ad-buying platforms (e.g., retail media networks, DSPs, and\nother strategic partners) to reach marketers buying programmatic advertising on such platforms and to create more\ndemand opportunities for Roku ad inventory. Our sales teams and products are organized into groups that specialize\nin the unique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and\nmid-market clients, (iii) content partners and entertainment brands, (iv) performance and direct-to-consumer\nbrands, (v) international markets, and (vi) local advertising.\nWe work with our licensed Roku TV partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\nplanning, manufacturing, and marketing. In the United States, the majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website\n(excluding Roku TV models). We also sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon,\nBest Buy, and Walmart collectively accounted for 71% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 67% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We support retailers with an experienced sales\nmanagement team and work closely with these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix\nforecasting. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and device sales. Our revenue and\ngross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a higher\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our streaming device sales through retailers in an effort to grow our\nActive Accounts, which typically reduce our devices gross margin or results in a devices gross loss in the fourth\nquarter.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and outsourced development and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new TVs, players, audio\nproducts, smart home devices, features, and functionality. We work closely with content partners, advertisers,\nlicensed Roku TV partners, and service operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a\nproduct development process that seeks to take input from our partners into account when making decisions about our\nfuture product and service offerings. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features and\nenhancements to our platform. We intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development to bring\nnew or improved products and services to market.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and\nother contractors and vendors. All of our products are manufactured in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast\nAsia, and Brazil. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any\nspecific price. Our manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish\nbased upon historical trends and analysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The\nmanufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in the United States and to our distributors in the\nUnited Kingdom and Brazil where we ship our products directly to retailers, wholesale distributors, and consumers.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our products and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprotections, often bringing enforcement actions for unfair acts or deceptive practices related to privacy and\nsecurity. And an increasing number of states have passed, or are considering, legislation to govern consumer\nprivacy. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate impose different, and sometimes more stringent,\nconsumer and privacy protections, compared to the United States. Consumer privacy laws, and regulators’\ninterpretations of these laws, may become more diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the challenges and\ncosts associated with complying with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit the ability of\nadvertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet.\nTo the extent regulators allow network operators to restrict the flow of content over the internet, such operators\nmay seek to extract fees from us or our content partners to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in\nblocking, throttling, or other discriminatory practices with respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact\nour business.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\ncertain local content quotas or production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 1,300 issued patents and 500 pending applications in the United\nStates and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our\nproduct offerings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business,\nsee Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on building scale by growing our Active Accounts, growing engagement by increasing the hours of content\nstreamed through our platform, and growing the monetization of the activities that viewers engage in through our\nplatform.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming devices and companies that license\ntheir operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs as well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach viewers on other content and advertising mediums,\nincluding on other ad-supported streaming services and social media apps;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games;\ncompanies that offer products that compete with our audio products or our smart home products and services; and\n10\nTable of Contents\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices or offer remote work positions that may be better\nable to attract and retain top talent in engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations,\nand other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects. Increasingly, we also compete with these same publishers in seeking to sell advertising to\nsupport the distribution of streaming content. A number of leading content publishers have launched new ad-\nsupported subscription tiers, which offer consumers access to content either for free or for a lower subscription\nfee.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2023, we employed approximately 3,150 full-time employees located in 15 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees have adopted a\nhybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level. We\nalso emphasize integrity, transparency, and honesty in our internal and external conduct of business. All employees\nare required to comply fully with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, which sets forth our values, business\nculture, and practices.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to leverage\nour broad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions. As we grow our business, our goal is to\nensure that Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nWe are committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. Since the launch of our formal diversity, equity,\nand inclusion (“DEI”) strategy in 2020, we have made considerable progress on elevating awareness of DEI, promoting\ndialogue and empathy, implementing employee resource groups, and expanding representation on The Roku Channel and\nthe Roku platform.\nOur dedicated Inclusion Strategy team partners across Roku’s global footprint to develop strategies and lead\ncoordinated initiatives that advance inclusive employee and viewer experiences. Our four-part DEI framework\nincludes four pillars: Employee Experience, Attract and Source, Leading Inclusively, and Customer Experience.\nEmployee Experience : We facilitate an inclusive employee experience through our pay equity analysis, learning and\ndevelopment offerings, internal and external communications, employee resource groups (“ERG”), and mentoring. In\n2023, we continued our U.S. pay equity analysis to help ensure we pay fairly and equitably across gender and\nethnicity, year over year. Our six voluntary and employee-led ERGs are highly engaged and foster a diverse and\ninclusive workplace, build internal community, encourage career growth and networking, and support social impact\npartnerships. In 2023, we delivered DEI offerings in the areas of bias, inclusive conversations, bridging gaps\nacross differences, and allyship. Our DEI Talks series featured a diverse group of tech and entertainment and media\nleaders. We also increased the frequency of DEI communications to amplify our commitment, both internally and\nexternally.\nAttract and Source : Our Inclusive Recruiting Program Manager and DEI specialists embedded within our Talent\nAcquisition team directly contribute to our efforts to be inclusive. In addition, every member of our Talent\nAcquisition team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit candidates from different backgrounds. To that\nend, our recruiters are equipped to discuss DEI best practices with hiring managers to ensure we continue to widen\nthe candidate pipeline for all roles and create inclusive recruiting experiences. Furthermore, our U.S. university\nrecruiting and intern programs embed DEI into their strategies so that our recruiting pipelines include\nhistorically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and underrepresented clubs and\nprograms across other schools where we recruit.\nOur external relationships are also focused on organizations that reflect underrepresented communities, including\ntechnical and non-technical women and underrepresented minority organizations, to enable our hiring managers and\nrecruiters to attend or speak at related conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story\nto a wider audience.\n11\nTable of Contents\nLeading Inclusively : Our leaders are instrumental in sustaining inclusive employee and customer experiences. We\nseek to increase opportunities for leaders to demonstrate inclusive leadership. Members of our executive management\nteam volunteer to serve as executive sponsors for our ERGs, while additional leaders volunteer to be executive\nadvocates or chairs. We are also building inclusive leadership awareness into our training and people manager\nresources and communications.\nCustomer Experience : As a TV streaming platform with both U.S. and international viewers, we believe our customer\nexperiences should reflect the diversity of our customers. We offer a slate of “inclusion zones” (including Black\nVoices, Pride, Latino Voices, Women’s Voices, and Asian and Pacific Islander Voices) on the Roku platform that\nhighlight and celebrate related stories from various content providers.\nCommunity Engagement and Social Impact\nWe have developed a Social Impact program that engages our local communities through employee volunteerism. Our\nprogram partners with organizations that provide opportunities for employees to mentor high school students through\nactivities such as career panels, industry masterclasses, and hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math\n(STEM) challenges.\nLearning and Talent Development\nOur Learning and Talent Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to\nsupport our strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive new hire\nonboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources employees need to increase our new hires’\nspeed to productivity. In addition to mandatory training covering anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, and\nprivacy, we offer employees a suite of highly encouraged training offerings covering topics such as high-\nperformance feedback, career development, change management, and communication skills. Managers are provided with\ntraining on expectations for managers and have access to a 1:1 leadership coaching program to support new and newly\npromoted leaders in managing and leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access to on-demand technical\nand non-technical skill development through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase,\nand custom-build additional training materials to support our global employees’ performance and development needs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation opportunity, we consider what that employee would be\npaid by another employer, what we would have to pay to replace that employee if the employee leaves Roku, and the\namount we would pay to retain that employee. Generally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of\nsalary and equity awards rather than offering specific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by\ndifferent employees. We generally do not pay cash bonuses (other than to employees eligible for sales commissions)\nor have performance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to our employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

industry is highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content\nowners and aggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to\ndifferentiate our streaming platform and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to\nattract and retain users and our business will be harmed.\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and\nretaining users on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need\nto be able to respond efficiently to changes in user tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to the\ncontent they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features\nand functionality of our streaming platform for users, content partners, and advertisers. We also must effectively\nsupport popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video,\nDisney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in\nthe TV streaming industry.\nLarge technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku\nstreaming devices made by us and our licensed Roku TV partners. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating\nsystem software for integration into smart TVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its\noperating system software for integration into smart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have\ngreater financial resources than we do and can subsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing\narrangements in order to promote their other products and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire\nnew users, retain existing users, increase Streaming Hours, and monetize our streaming platform. These companies\ncould also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or that provide a better\nstreaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands through advertising than\nwe do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast and\nCharter Communications (and their joint venture, Xumo, LLC), offer TV streaming applications and devices as part of\ntheir cable service plans and can leverage their existing user bases, installation networks, broadband delivery\nnetworks, and name recognition to gain traction in TV streaming. If viewers of TV streaming content prefer\nalternative products to Roku streaming devices, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in Active\nAccounts, Streaming Hours, platform revenue, gross profit or ARPU.\nWe also compete for Streaming Hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may\nprefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming\ncould adversely impact the growth of our Streaming Hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to continue to increase in the future. This increased competition could result\nin pricing pressure, lower revenue and gross profit, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our platform or our\nother products to gain or maintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a\nleading TV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing,\nservice and support, and device distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards and unknown future\ndevelopments may require further investments in the development of Roku streaming devices, our platform and our\nother products. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In addition, many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name\nrecognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other\nresources than us, which provide them with advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and\nofferings. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the\ndevelopment, promotion, sales, and distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance\nof their products better than we can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging\ntechnologies or standards and may be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition\ncould reduce our sales volume, revenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive\nposition, and otherwise harm our business.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer our own lines of Roku-branded smart home products and services,\nincluding indoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells, smart lighting, smart plugs, and home monitoring products,\nand audio products, including wireless speakers and subwoofers. As a result, we face additional competition from\nother brands of smart home products and audio products. If these products do not operate as designed or do not\nenhance the TVs powered by the Roku OS or other viewing experiences as we intend, our users’ overall viewing\nexperience may be diminished, and this may impact the overall demand for our products and our partners’ Roku TV\nmodels.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of streaming TV advertising and advertising platforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, including social media and other digital platforms, as well as traditional media,\nsuch as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content\nand other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These\ncompetitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may\nadversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from\nadvertising. For example, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video have launched ad-supported tiers in their\nstreaming services, which has further increased competition for streaming advertising revenue. If we are unable to\nincrease our revenue from advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to\nfurther optimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory and reach, and\nmaintaining a strong advertising sales team and programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects\nmay be harmed. We may not be able to compete effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm\nour ability to grow our advertising revenue and would harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to advertising in\ntraditional media or on other digital platforms, such as traditional TV, radio, print publications, and social\nmedia. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of streaming TV advertising and on advertisers\nincreasing their spending on advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers have shown growing\ninterest in streaming TV advertising, we cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that\nthey will not revert to traditional TV advertising or shift their advertising spending to social media and other\ndigital platforms (rather than to us). In addition, if we are unable to compete with social media and other digital\nplatforms to win business from advertisers and advertising agencies who have traditionally advertised on these\nplatforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small or medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be\nlimited. If advertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of streaming TV\nadvertising, the market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely impact our operating results\nand our ability to grow our business.\nFinally, there is political or regulatory pressure in some countries to limit streaming TV advertising (including\nlimiting the advertising that may be associated with children’s content) or impose local content requirements on\nstreaming TV services, which could pose a threat to our services.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content partners. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls). As such, we are seeking to expand the number of Active Accounts\nand increase Streaming Hours in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user base\ngrows and as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively\nmonetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of Streaming Hours, however, does not\ncorrelate with platform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour\nstreamed or every user on our platform. Moreover, Streaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku\nstreaming device is streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a player is\nconnected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the\nplayer, then the particular streaming app may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the\nstreaming app (although all Roku devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when content has\nbeen continuously streaming on an app for an extended period of time without user interaction, which periodically\nprompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the selected app and closes the app if the user does not\nrespond affirmatively).\nOur ability to deliver advertisements relevant to our users and to increase our platform’s value to advertisers and\ncontent partners depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or prevented by a\nnumber of factors, including the evolving data protection legal landscape. Users may decide to opt out or restrict\nour ability to collect viewing data or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content partners may also\nrefuse to allow us to collect data regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure\ncompliance with our legal obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize\nprogram level viewing data from many of our most popular apps to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided\nto our users.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOther apps available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on\nincreasing user engagement and time spent within their apps by allowing users to purchase additional content and\nstreaming services within their apps; when users purchase these additional services within these apps, we may earn\nless revenue than when the services are purchased directly from us. If our users spend most of their time within\nparticular apps where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user information, or our\nusers opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant advertisements, we may not be\nable to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit. Additionally, our distribution agreements\nwith our most popular apps are renegotiated periodically; thus, even if we are currently able to monetize Streaming\nHours within an app, we may not be able to do so in the future. If we are unable to further monetize our streaming\nplatform, our business may be harmed.\nOur efforts to monetize our streaming platform through ad-supported content may not continue to grow as we expect,\nand our platform revenue growth has been, and may continue to be, lower than expected due to advertisers\nsignificantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to inflationary pressures, recessionary fears or other\nreasons that are out of our control. In addition, advertisers’ spending commitments, such as those we obtain in\nconnection with annual TV Upfront presentations, are typically not fully binding, and the revenue we receive from\nsuch commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. This means that in order to materially increase\nthe monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we will need to attract\nsignificantly more advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-supported content that\nresults in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nIf we are not successful in running a demand-side platform (“DSP”) or in working with other third-party demand\nsources, our business may be harmed.\nThrough OneView (our proprietary DSP) and other third-party demand sources (such as third-party DSPs and supply-\nside platforms), advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage their streaming TV,\ndesktop, and mobile advertising campaigns both on and off the Roku platform. The market for programmatic streaming\nTV ad buying is an evolving market, and our current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not\ncontinue to shift to programmatic ad buying from other buying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the\nmarket for programmatic streaming TV ad buying deteriorates or develops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and\nadvertising agencies may not use OneView or other third-party demand sources, and our business could be harmed. If\nwe are unable to expand our programmatic demand by maintaining and developing third-party demand relationships in a\nway that is competitive with other advertising platforms, our business could be harmed. In addition, if OneView or\nother third-party demand sources do not have the functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising\nagencies, they may take their advertising spend to a non-Roku platform. We also may not be able to adapt to changes\nor trends in programmatic streaming TV advertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue\nand harm our business.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV\npartners and manufacturing partners and, to a lesser extent, service operators.\nWe license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand and manufacturing partners for the\ndevelopment, manufacture, and commercialization of licensed Roku TV models. We have developed, and intend to\ncontinue to develop and expand, relationships with these TV brand and manufacturing partners. We continue to invest\nin the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and international markets. For a\nnumber of years, the sale of Roku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has materially contributed to growth\nin our Active Accounts and Streaming Hours, and supported our platform monetization efforts. This growth has\nprimarily been driven by North America; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to certain\ninternational markets and has represented an increased share of new Active Accounts. We do not typically receive,\nnor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we typically incur operating\nexpenses in connection with establishing and supporting these commercial agreements.\nThe primary economic benefits that we derive from these license arrangements have been and will likely continue to\nbe indirect, primarily from growing our Active Accounts, increasing Streaming Hours, and thereby enabling us to\ngenerate more streaming services distribution and advertising-related revenue on our platform. If these\narrangements do not continue to result in increased Active Accounts and Streaming Hours, and if that growth does\nnot in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner (including as a result of our launch of Roku-branded TVs\nthat are designed, made, and sold by us) could harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase\npricing and promotional pressures from other partners and retail distribution channels, increase our marketing\ncosts, and result in the loss of revenue. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new\nrelationships with any of these third parties, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, or other\nimpediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or maintain our business could be adversely impacted.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe have also developed licensing relationships with certain service operators, primarily in international markets;\nhowever, this program has been decreasing in scale in recent years, and as a result we have shifted the focus of\nour international growth to the sale of Roku streaming devices and expanding our Roku TV licensing program. Based\non the decreasing scale of our licensing program for service operators, including termination of these\nrelationships, we expect that the number of Active Accounts generated from this program will continue to decline,\nwhich may impact the overall growth rate of our Active Accounts in international markets.\nOur Roku TV licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and\npotential partners include TV brands, retailers, cable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers.\nUnder these license arrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources\nthese entities dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their\nforecasts and anticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to meet their\nforecasts or such launches in the future. If our licensed Roku TV partners or service operator partners fail to\nmeet their forecasts or such launches for distributing licensed streaming devices or choose to deploy competing\nstreaming solutions within their product lines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content partners for a majority of our Streaming Hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content partners have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed on\nour platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the top three streaming services represented almost 50%\nof all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing apps that have historically streamed\na large percentage of the aggregate Streaming Hours on our platform, our Streaming Hours, our Active Accounts, or\nRoku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming apps, streaming app features, and content. In order to remain competitive,\nwe must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming apps, streaming app features, and content, particularly\nas we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by the Roku OS, or enter new markets, including\ninternational markets. If we are not successful in helping our content publishers launch and maintain streaming\napps and streaming app features that attract and retain a significant number of users on our streaming platform or\nif we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be harmed. Our ability to successfully\nhelp content publishers maintain and expand their app offerings on a cost-effective basis largely depends on our\nability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming apps;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming apps; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream\ncertain apps or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of\npopular streaming apps or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand\ntheir audiences on our platform or their apps are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nThe non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content partners may result in the removal of certain\napps or app features from our streaming platform and may harm our streaming device sales, Active Account growth,\nand engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content partners, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates and rights to terminate under certain circumstances. Our agreements with content partners\ngenerally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the end of the term by the content partner\nunder certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy,\ncommit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content partners’ security or other platform certification requirements.\nUpon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing\ncontent from these content partners on our streaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future\nmay not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content partners before our existing agreements\nhave expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, or if a\ncontent partner terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we may be required to temporarily or\npermanently remove certain apps or app features from our streaming platform.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe loss of such apps or app features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our business.\nMore broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content partners on terms favorable to us, or at\nall, or if these content partners face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may lose app\npartners or users and our streaming device sales, Active Account growth, and engagement may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or generate\nsufficient demand to effectively sell our available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to\nsell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure\ncontent that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient\nsupply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are\nalso dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported apps on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content partners of such apps. We may fail\nto attract content partners that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on our\nstreaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming apps on our platform varies\ngreatly among apps. Accordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video ad inventory on our\nplatform. For certain apps, including YouTube’s ad-supported app, we have no access to video ad inventory at this\ntime and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services introduce new ad-supported\ntiers to their streaming services, we have in the past and in the future may not be able to reach agreement on\naccess to video ad inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. The amount, quality, and cost\nof video ad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow and maintain a sufficient\nsupply of quality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our business may be harmed.\nFurther, even if we have an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory, we may not be able to generate\nsufficient demand for such ad inventory or sell the ad inventory at our desired price. If we are unable to\neffectively sell our available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nIf our content partners do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content partners or meet their requirements. For example, some content partners have elected not\nto participate in our new home screen menu features or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage within\ntheir apps. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language in order\nto allow our content partners to develop and create apps on our streaming platform. Certain content partners may\nfind other languages, such as HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their\napps on other platforms. If key content partners do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to\ndevelop apps for, do not value and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform\noffers, or determine that our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their\nrequirements, our business may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform decrease, or the\ncampaigns that run are not relevant or not engaging to our users, our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to engage with more advertisers and content partners, and\nenable them to deliver more relevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our\nusers. However, a small number of content partners historically have accounted for a significant portion of the\nmedia and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform, and we believe recent consolidation among\ncontent partners has resulted in decreased media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform.\nIf our content partners continue to decrease the media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our\nplatform, our financial condition and operating results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, existing and prospective advertisers and content partners may not be successful in serving ads and\nmedia and entertainment promotional spending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and\ncampaigns may seem irrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance\nthe objectives of our advertisers and content partners with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but\nwe may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and\ncontent partners.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant, are overly intrusive, or are too frequent and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using\nour platform, resulting in a reduction of our Active Accounts and Streaming Hours, which will harm our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our operation of The Roku Channel.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television\nseries, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses\nin connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily\nthrough advertising. For example, we previously acquired content rights, including rights to certain projects in\ndevelopment, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and made The Roku Channel the home of\nsuch content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old House business, which own and produce\nthe “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related business lines, to further the growth\nstrategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel. We also commission original content that we own\nand distribute on The Roku Channel. From time to time, we may remove underperforming content from The Roku Channel\nand record an impairment change related to such removal, as we did in the third quarter of 2023.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The\nagreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make\nspecific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these\nagreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new\nagreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the\nduration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable\nterms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku\nChannel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers,\nusage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed. Further, even if we successfully monetize\nThe Roku Channel in the United States, we may not be successful in monetizing The Roku Channel in international\nmarkets.\nIn addition, we produce content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited\nexperience producing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing\nto our users and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with\ncontent production, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel\nare not relevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the\navailable content, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku\nChannel may not generate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition,\nwe distribute The Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance\nthat we will be successful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising\nthrough the distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other apps on our platform, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content partners activated on or through our platform,\nincluding Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from various content\npartners. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or subscriptions for any\nreason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content partners or by other\nmeans for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain apps available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from\nwithin those apps. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn from\nsales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their spending on\nsuch in-app transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business may be harmed.\nWe and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective\nproducts, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners\ncould experience lower product sales.\nTo continue to grow our Active Accounts, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and for\nthe Roku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon.\nWe also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers\nsuch as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, MediaMarkt in Germany, and Currys in the United Kingdom. As we\nhave only recently expanded to certain international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or\nrelationships with retailers for those markets as compared to our retail sales channels in the United States or our\ncompetitors in international markets.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur retailers and distributors also sell products that compete with our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’\nproducts, including house-branded televisions sold by such retailers that utilize TV operating systems other than\nthe Roku OS. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or\ndistributors, and there can be no assurance that we will reach agreements with our retailers and distributors on\nterms we find acceptable or that will be consistent with our past practices. We may be reliant on certain retailers\nor distributors. Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in total accounted for 71% and 67% of our devices revenue for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Furthermore, our licensed Roku TV partners\nmay be reliant on the same retailers and distributors or other retailers and distributors for a significant portion\nof their unit sales of Roku TV models. If one or several retailers or distributors were to discontinue selling our\nproducts or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to prominently display those products in their\nstores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations, the volume of\nour products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could decrease, which would harm our business. These\nrisks may be exacerbated by our reliance on certain retailers or distributors, or when a major retailer in a\njurisdiction commercializes televisions under brands that the retailer controls.\nIn addition, if any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work exclusively with, or divert a\nsignificant portion of their business with us to, other operating system developers, this may adversely impact our\nability to continue to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV brands and to grow Active\nAccounts and monetize the Roku OS. Traditional retailers have limited shelf and end cap space in their stores and\nlimited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website product placement space. Competition\nis intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines, stronger brand identity and\ngreater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In\naddition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart\nhome devices, is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to\noffer or promote our products on its website. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our products, or\nincreased competition for available shelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing or other\nexpenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in reduced visibility for our products, which may\nharm our business. In particular, the availability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the\nholiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our products during\nthese periods, our business would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor, and our\nbrand may be negatively impacted by factors that are out of our control, such as the quality and reliability of the\nRoku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content that our content partners\nprovide. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and consumer demand for their products\nmore quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and may have greater\nresources to devote to the promotion of their brands through traditional advertising, digital advertising, or\nwebsite product placement. If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand, it may be difficult to\ndifferentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace, which may adversely\naffect our ability to attract and retain users and harm our business.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of apps, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content partners. Our users can choose and control which apps they download and watch, and\nthey can use certain settings to prevent apps from being downloaded to Roku streaming devices. While we have\npolicies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates third-\nparty rights, among other things, we may distribute apps that include controversial content. Controversies related\nto the content included on certain apps that we distribute have resulted in, and could in the future result in,\nnegative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.\nThis credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In\naddition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated\nperiod of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. Further,\nwe typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While\nwe attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not\nalways successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than\nour accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements, or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or\nthrough our DSP. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In\nthe future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may increase over time.\nAny increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on time or at all,\nour business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we\ncould lose users, advertisers, content partners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.\nOur users depend on our customer support organization to resolve issues relating to our products and our streaming\nplatform. A high level of support is critical for the success of our business. We currently outsource the majority\nof our customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end\nusers. In addition, we train our licensed Roku TV partners and service operator licensees to provide first-level\ncustomer support to users of Roku TV models and other devices. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage\nour third-party customer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if that support organization\ndoes not succeed in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely\naffect our ability to monetize our streaming platform, to sell our products to users and could harm our reputation\nwith potential new customers and our licensees.\nWe must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new\nproducts and services expose our business to new risks.\nWe must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet\nchanging consumer demands. The introduction of a new product or service is a complex task, involving significant\nexpenditures in research and development, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to\nnew risks. The introduction of new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may\nresult in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications\nthat could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. For example, we have faced and may\ncontinue to face new intellectual property infringement claims related to new products and services we have\nintroduced. In addition, our entrance into entirely new lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV\nstreaming and advertising, such as our launch of Roku-branded smart home products (including home monitoring\nproducts) and shoppable ads that allow users to purchase advertised products and services directly from their Roku\nstreaming devices, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ from the risks we face as a\nresult of our historical TV streaming business. In particular, the provision of home monitoring services is a\nhighly regulated industry where various licensing requirements may apply in each jurisdiction where such services\nare offered.\nWhether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our\nability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to\nour streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. The development of\nnew products and services is a highly complex process, and we do not expect that all of our projects will be\nsuccessful.\nThe successful development and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing\nmishaps, and shipping delays;\nour ability to obtain required licenses and comply with other regulatory requirements; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or services\nin a timely or cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract\nmanufacturers, and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among\nother issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from labor disputes, strikes, mechanical\nissues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health crises; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new products.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component\nshortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems in the past have impaired, and could in the\nfuture impair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in\nour contract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our\nretailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our\nproducts. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete\ndesired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract\nmanufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because\nof inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they\ndecide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or terminated, and we would\nhave to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract manufacturers.\nAlternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy\nour production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely\nbasis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could\nrequire us to reduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our\nrevenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,\nare located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,\nsocial, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or\ndisrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the tensions between\nTaiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese suppliers,\nour supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international location of these\nfacilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade restrictions on\nexports or imports.\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems\nwith their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.\nSome of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or\nexclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to\nretailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in\ntariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports: restrictions, by the\nUnited States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or\ncomponents for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or\nsuppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku\nTV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV\nmodels at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models\nsold at retail, resulting in slower Active Accounts and Streaming Hours growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models\ncould harm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our\ncontract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nproducts are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many\nmonths in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess\ncomponents and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or\nbuild excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have\nagreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our\ndecision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess\nsupply commitments, our business may be harmed.\nConversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material\nor component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities\navailable to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In\naddition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship\nour products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross\nmargin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately\nforecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nobtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to\nour retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players\nand TVs powered by the Roku OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi\nfront-end module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a\nsecond source.\nAlthough this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering\ndevelopment and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also\ncreates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or\nmaterial supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other\nexport or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their\ncomponents (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.\nThere is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired\nby or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on\nallocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control\nrestrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,\nor logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary\npressures, geopolitical conflict, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and\nmay in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,\nand which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source\nsupplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,\nand may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and\nharm our business.\nIf our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content partners\nand other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via\nRoku streaming devices offered at a low cost to users. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all apps\nand other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners, including virtual multi-channel video\nprogramming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings, technologies, and\nsystems beyond our app certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not provide our users with a\nhigh-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are made to those offerings that\nare not compatible with Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase Active Account growth and user\nengagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, the Roku-branded TVs we launched\nin 2023 and our recently announced Roku Pro Series TVs, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such\nproducts to function well with these offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content\npartners have the right to test and certify our new products before we can publish their apps. The certification\nprocesses can be time-consuming and introduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If our\ncontent partners do not certify new products on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain\ncertifications, our product release plans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products\nto all licensed Roku TV partners or we may not continue to offer certain apps. To continue to grow our Active\nAccounts and user engagement, we will need to prioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with\nnew offerings, technologies, and systems, including our smart home products and services. If we are unable to\nmaintain consistent operability of Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms,\nour business could be harmed.\nIn addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners may impact the\naccessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of Roku streaming devices. We may not\nsuccessfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these offerings, technologies, or\nsystems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings, technologies, or systems,\nour business could be harmed.\nOur products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in\nways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have contained and may in the future\ncontain hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any number of ways\nin our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, data\nloss or poor quality, device malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. Some errors may only be\ndiscovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be detected under certain\ncircumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance\nprocesses, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such update.\nThe introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a\nlimited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product\nsupport, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of\ntime. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in\nrevenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information\nliability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with\nour end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be\nupheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely\naffect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate\nor future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\n25\nTable of Contents\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown\nto us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they\ncould cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by\nwhich our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network\nrouter. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access\npoint, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to\nrecall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable cost and expense. Should we have a\nwidespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to\ndevelop new products or streaming platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize or enable certain industry standard and other commercially available technology in our products and\nstreaming platform that is licensed by third parties. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to\nour products and on our streaming platform, we may be required to license additional technologies from third\nparties. These third-party licenses may be unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party licenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies\nwith lower quality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of\nour products, streaming platform, and our business.\nWe are incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and services, which may present operational and\nreputational risks.\nWe have incorporated and intend to continue incorporate AI technologies, such as generative AI, into our products\nand services. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could adversely impact our business.\nFor example, AI technologies can create accuracy issues, unintended biases, and discriminatory outcomes, or may\ncreate content that appears correct but is inaccurate or flawed. If the recommendations, content, or analyses that\nAI applications produce are or are alleged to be deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive\nharm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI\ntechnologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and\nprivacy and data protection. For example, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of\nintellectual property rights related to the use, development, and deployment of AI technologies. Compliance with\nnew or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and\nmay limit our ability to develop, deploy or use AI technologies. There can be no assurance that the measures we\nhave taken to mitigate the potential risks related to generative AI will be sufficient. Failure to appropriately\nrespond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational\nharm.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior\nquarters, we may continue to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability\nagain in the near term or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we\nachieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near\nterm or at all. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,297.6 million. Our operating expenses\nhave increased in the past and may increase again in the future as we expand our operations and invest in growth\nand new areas. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may\nnot be able to achieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of\nreasons, including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may\nencounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may\nresult in losses in future periods.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-\nto-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\n26\nTable of Contents\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;\nour ability to retain and grow our Active Accounts, increase engagement among new and existing users, and\nmonetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or\nother macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is\ncurrently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory on\nour advertising platform;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, apps, or features;\nthe addition or removal of content or apps from our platform;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;\ndelays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or\ndistribution chains; and\nan increase in legal costs, including costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending\nagainst third-party intellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual\nproperty.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment (which generates revenue from\nthe sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products, and related\naccessories, as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators) experienced negative gross\nmargins for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and our platform segment (which generates revenue from the\nsale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video advertising, media and entertainment\npromotional spending, and related services) and streaming services distribution (including subscription and\ntransaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote\ncontrols)) experienced positive gross margin for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Gross margins on our\nstreaming devices vary across models and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and\nconfiguration changes, component costs, device returns, and other cost fluctuations.\nIn addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or retail sales channel mix, component cost increases, price\ncompetition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or\nreduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin or record\nnegative gross margin on devices in an effort to increase the number of Active Accounts and grow our gross profit.\nAs a result, our devices segment revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless\nwe are able to continue to increase our platform segment revenue and grow the number of Active Accounts, we may be\nunable to grow gross profit and our business will be harmed. For example, in the past, global supply chain\ndisruptions have resulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in\ncomponent prices, which negatively affected our devices gross margin. If a reduction in gross margin does not\nresult in an increase in our Active Accounts or an increase in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial\nresults may suffer, and our business may be harmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past,\nand may experience in the future, lower gross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower\nthan we anticipate, our financial results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and may continue to expand certain of these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and any future growth will continue to place, significant demands on\nour management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\n27\nTable of Contents\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nexpand our product offerings;\nsupport our licensed Roku TV partners and service operators;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to\nexecute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have previously undertaken restructuring plans to adjust our investment priorities and manage our operating\nexpenses, and we may do so again in the future. For example, in 2023, we approved measures to lower our year-over-\nyear operating expense growth rate by consolidating our office space utilization, performing a strategic review of\nour content portfolio, reducing outside services expenses, and slowing our year-over-year headcount expense growth\nrate through workforce reductions and limiting new hires, among other measures.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, material costs and charges in connection with restructuring plans\nand initiatives, and there can be no assurance that any restructuring plans and initiatives will be successful. Any\nrestructuring plans may adversely affect our internal programs and our ability to recruit and retain skilled and\nmotivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, or inefficiency during\ntransitional periods, may require a significant amount of employees’ time and focus, and may be distracting to\nemployees, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. For more information, see Note 17 to\nthe consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or are unable to manage our\ngrowth and expansion plans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business,\noperating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and\nhave greater experience managing a global organization.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and\nregulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade\n(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content\nrestrictions, use of AI technologies, copyright and intellectual property, and local content and advertising\nrequirements, among others;\nexposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK\nBribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws\nprohibiting improper payments to government officials and requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records\nand a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that\nconsumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by\nincumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\n28\nTable of Contents\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming apps or content to users in certain international\nmarkets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, whatever the cause, including\ndue to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of\nUkraine and the Israel-Hamas war), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic\ntensions (such as the tension between China and Taiwan), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World\nTrade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;\nany pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the\nuse of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such\nservices to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for\nmaterials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange\nRate Risk” in Item 7A of this Annual Report for additional information);\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIn addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our business model in international markets. Three\ncore areas of focus define our business model: first, we grow scale by increasing our Active Accounts; second, we\ngrow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform; and, third, we grow monetization\nof the activities that users engage in through our platform. Even if we are able to increase our Active Accounts in\ninternational markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our Streaming Hours or monetize user activity in those\nmarkets. Further, as of December 31, 2023, our ARPU was lower in international markets than in the United States.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday seasons fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit are\ntraditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total net\nrevenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the\naverage selling prices of our products through retailers in an effort to grow our Active Accounts, which typically\nreduce our devices gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our product sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, reductions in consumer discretionary spending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our\nsupply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or air freight delays, or for any\nother reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly.\nFor example, macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressures negatively affected consumer electronics sales\nduring the holiday season in 2023. In addition, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the past, and\nmay in the future, adversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver products to\nretailers during holiday seasons.\n29\nTable of Contents\nA substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nbenefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue\nshortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in\nthe short term, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our\nemployees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources\nto identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. To attract top talent,\nwe generally offer competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In\naddition, many companies now offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for\nemployees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and\nmay in the future need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition\nand other business and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled\nemployees necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\npast or any additional workforce reductions could harm employee morale and negatively impact employee recruiting\nand retention.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,\nand other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and\nfinancial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content partners, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, licensed Roku TV partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in\nerrors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could\nadversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and\ndisputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient financial\nreturns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions.\n30\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen\noperating difficulties and expenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies\ninvolve areas of operation in which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products,\nor technologies in international markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of\noperations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and\nregulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at\nall, without incurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address\nsuch risks successfully, our business could be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming\nplatform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the\nhiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic\nconditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nIn addition, we currently have no committed source of financing, and may need to obtain financing via a credit\nfacility in the future. Any future credit agreements we may enter into could require a lien on our assets or\ncontain financial covenants and other restrictions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise\nadversely affect our financial condition. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms\nsatisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to\nbusiness challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nWe maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial\ninstitutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.\nWe maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks that exceed the\nFDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not\ninsured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited\nliquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns\nor rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, in 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed\nand was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or\ncredit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity\nand financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable\ninsurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial\ninstitution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government\ninstitutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,\nand other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card\ninformation, user video and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential\ninformation. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of such information. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry\nstandards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of personal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security\nsafeguards as part of an information security program, and complying with requirements regarding the use or cross-\nborder transfer of such personal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our\nbusiness partners, our users, and other relevant stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to\nexisting and potential users.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and user video\nand audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or\ncould have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential\ninformation. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their\nresponsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of\nthird parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex.\nWhile all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security\nbreaches, incidents, attacks, and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our\ninformation technology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems,\nmake such systems vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal, and external threats on our technology\nenvironment. Vulnerabilities can be, and have been, exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our\nemployees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties.\nFor example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have experienced,\nand remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, improper employee\naccess of confidential data, and inadvertent employee disclosure of confidential data. Malicious attacks are\nincreasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by\nsophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to,\nindustrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others.\nThe geopolitical conflicts stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the current unrest in the Middle East\nhave increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations globally, including for companies\nheadquartered in the United States, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and\nability to produce, sell, and distribute our devices and services.\nMost of our employees now have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols, the actions of our employees while working from home may\nhave a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of\ncompromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from employees’ combined use of personal and\nprivate devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do not control, or the ability to\ntransmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or\nintellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the\nnature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our\nsystems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,\ncontent partners’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our\ndata (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or\nintellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or\nservices in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to\nprotect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the\nthreat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our\ncybersecurity.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRecent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks,\nwith increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and\nmethodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may impact our\nability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors experience an\noutage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally, our third-party\nvendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such third parties\nfor use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be\naffected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open-source software, which may be incorporated into our\nsystems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which we are not\naware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. We cannot assure you that we will not be impacted by\nransomware, cybersecurity attacks, or other vulnerabilities in the future.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that security incidents may not be covered by our insurance\npolicies, and not all aspects of a security incident may be covered even where coverage exists. Insurance policies\nwill also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security incident. Even where an incident is\ncovered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we\nmay be faced with in the wake of a security incident.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our streaming platform, streaming\ndevices, smart home products, website, computer systems, or mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business,\nsubject us to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our\nreputation. Efforts to prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in\nour products are expensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or\nvulnerabilities.\nSuch unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk\nof contractual damages, litigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of\nharm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings\nand as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial\nresources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other\nsimilar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\nforeign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our\nproduct development and our business operations.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to\nsystems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that\nleads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal\ninformation regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable federal or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time-consuming,\ndistracting, and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require\nus to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations,\nand contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This\ncould result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm.\n33\nTable of Contents\nFor example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties\nand related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment\nCard Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.\nPenalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities\nwithin the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our\nprivacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further\nsecurity incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer\nof sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims\nby third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents.\nData protection laws around the world often require “reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and\norganizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws are often uncertain and\nevolving, and there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or\nreasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in\naccordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain. In addition\nto potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a data security incident, which could\nadversely affect our business operations and result in substantial costs and reputational harm.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential\ninformation, which creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),\nother consumers, employees, job applicants and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect,\nprocess, transmit, and store personal or confidential information (including our users’ payment card data and video\nand audio recordings). We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad\nand may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service\nproviders and our business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related\ntechnologies, to help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and\npartners’ content and deliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our\npartners on our products.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent partners’ streaming apps. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully leverage\nthis data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be restricted\nby a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our service\nproviders’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by advertisers,\ncontent partners, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws, regulations,\nand industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit access to or\nstorage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for advertising)\nthat is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of a\ntransmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection\nof information which is used for advertising purposes.\nAdditionally, certain device manufacturers or operating system providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and\nsimilar technologies, or otherwise restrict the collection of personal information through these or other tools,\nvia our applications. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our\nrevenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising\ncampaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and\nsecurity of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory\nenvironment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,\ncontent distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally.\n34\nTable of Contents\nPrivacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”),\nstate attorneys general, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian\nnational data protection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that\nidentify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the\ninternet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and\nforeign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict\nindustry participants’ ability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of\nconsumer notice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies or collect\ncategories of personal information deemed sensitive. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation\n(“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage, and use of personal information related\nto people located in the EU (or which is processed in the context of EU operations) and places data protection\nobligations and restrictions on organizations, and may require us to make further changes to our policies and\nprocedures in the future beyond what we have already done. In addition, in the wake of the United Kingdom’s\nwithdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted a framework similar to the GDPR. The EU has\nrecently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being “adequate” to receive EU personal data. We are\nmonitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data protection framework and the impact this may\nhave on our business.\nWe will continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not\ncompliant with data protection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines\nand penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For\nexample, under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant\ncompany, whichever is higher, as well as data processing restrictions, could be imposed for violation of certain of\nthe GDPR’s requirements.\nData protection laws continue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. The\nU.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based data\nprivacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider additional\ndata privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and may require\nus to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to\ncomply. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides for civil penalties for violations, as\nwell as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California\nPrivacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amended the CCPA and became effective on January 1, 2023 (with a “look-back” to\nJanuary 1, 2022), and among other things, requires the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate and enforce\nthe CCPA.\nFurthermore, rules governing new technological developments, such as developments in generative AI, remain\nunsettled. Several national and local governments have proposed or enacted measures related to the use of AI\ntechnologies in products and services. For example, in the EU, there is a proposed regulation related to AI that is\nproceeding towards adoption. If adopted, this regulation could impose new and substantial obligations related to\nthe use of AI-related systems. In the United States, there similarly is growing interest among federal, state, and\nlocal policymakers with respect to potential legislation, regulation and/or guidance to address perceived concerns\nwith the rapid uptake of AI technologies. The rules and regulations adopted by policymakers over time may require\nus to make changes to our business practices.\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments\nto existing laws on our business. Among other things, such restrictions are likely to increase the number of users\nto whom we cannot serve targeted advertising, and are likely to restrict our ability to collect and process certain\ntypes of information deemed sensitive under these new laws. The Canadian province of Quebec has also recently\nenacted a data protection law, known as Bill 64, that may similarly restrict our data processing activities.\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.\nAdditionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a\nsecurity breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause\nour users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United\nStates. After a period of uncertainty concerning certain mechanisms for data transfers to the United States, on\nJuly 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision concerning a new framework for data transfers\nfrom the EEA to the United States, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”).\n35\nTable of Contents\nThat decision recognizes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal information\ntransferred from the EEA to organizations participating in the EU-U.S. DPF. The United Kingdom has made a similar\ndetermination, providing a means by which data transfers may take place between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\nThat framework is known as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and it went into effect on October 12, 2023. Roku\nis currently evaluating participation in the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension.\nIn addition, cloud service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny from EU\nregulators, which may lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal\ninformation outside the EU, which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate.\nWe continue to assess the available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data\nProtection Authorities and the U.S. Department of Commerce on international data transfer compliance for companies,\nincluding guidance on specific supplementary measures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data\nsharing that may be deemed a cross-border transfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our\nability to continue to transfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may\nsubject us to increased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience\noperating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter\nrequirements for certain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.\nMaintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect\nthat, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and\nenforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CPRA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will\nlead to increased operational and compliance costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary,\nmake changes to our operations, policies, and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-\nrelated legal obligations, or any compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement\nactions, litigation, contractual indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or\nothers. In addition to potential liability, these events could harm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so.\nMoreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, representatives,\nagents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and\ndocumentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state, and federal action if they\nare found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing\nlaws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase\nour cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service\nproviders and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku OS, streaming platform, smart home products,\nand computer systems. For example, our smart home product line is reliant on (among other things) the engineering\nand software development teams and information technology systems of the service providers we use to assist in the\ndesign, manufacture, and maintenance of those products. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer\nsystems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-\nbased or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we\nexercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that\nthey may experience.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIn the future, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting systems to cloud\ncomputing services, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we are unable to\nmanage such a transition effectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services, operational delays, or\ninefficiencies until the transition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with\nthird-party vendors, we may not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions,\nincluding service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor\ncould subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In addition, fires,\nfloods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-\nins, and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely.\nAs we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could\nadversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully\ncover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these\nvendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform\nperformance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to\naccommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated\nchanges in technology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their\ncontinued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over\nnetwork operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as\nany decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic.\nAny material disruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by\nISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of\nwhich could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide users with access to the internet also offer users multichannel\nvideo programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators have an\nincentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of other\ncompanies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to provide\npreferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our\nproducts and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us and may seek to challenge\nthe validity or enforceability of our own patents and patents applications. The cost of patent litigation or other\nproceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of our competitors may\nbe better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their substantially greater\nfinancial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant management time and\ndivert management’s attention from our other business concerns or otherwise adversely affect our business and\noperating results. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other\nproceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could\nharm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all, thereby hindering our ability to sell or use the relevant technology, or requiring redesign of the\nallegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time‐consuming, or impossible. Even if\nwe are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and\nthe rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to gain access to the same\nintellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property licenses may not include\nrights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the scope of the licenses\ngranted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us and our licensees.\nFurthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages\nand attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property; cease making,\nlicensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of\nothers; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into potentially unfavorable\nroyalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content, or materials;\nand indemnify our partners and other third parties.\nFor example, we have in the past elected to develop and implement specific design changes to address potential\nrisks that certain products could otherwise become subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from\npatent infringement and other intellectual property claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In\naddition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to\nresolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.\nHowever, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop\nour intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our\nagreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach\nthat agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to\ndiscover such breaches, and if we do, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot\nguarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that\ncompetitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent\ninformation and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim\nthat a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result\nin substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information.\nOur efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a\nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to\nprevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of\nour trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could\nharm our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including\nbusiness decisions about when to file patents and when to maintain trade secrets, will be adequate to protect our\nbusiness. We have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be\ninnovative. There is no guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the\nprotection gained will be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nU.S. patent laws, and the scope of coverage afforded by them, have been subject to significant changes, such as the\nchange to “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in\nthe determination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Foreign patent laws may also continue to develop and significantly impact our ability\nto protect or maintain our intellectual property. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant\nimpact on our ability to protect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our\nbusiness.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Despite the cost and time we spend\nmonitoring, we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be\nharmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In\nparticular, our actions to monitor and enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit\nversions of our products or products bearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace,\nwhich could divert sales from us, tarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products. In some\ncircumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property\nposition or for other business reasons.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open-source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open-source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have\nincorporated open-source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of\ncertain open-source software or compliance with open-source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject\nto similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or our noncompliance\nwith the open-source software license terms.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open-source software, these processes\nand procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many\nopen-source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or\ntechnology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. Some open‐source\nsoftware is governed by licenses containing conditions that any person who distributes or uses a modification or\nderivative work of software that was subject to an open‐source license make the modified version subject to the\nsame open‐source license. Distributing or using software that is subject to this kind of open‐source license can\nlead to a requirement that certain aspects of our solutions be distributed or made available in source code form.\nIn such event, we could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar\nopen-source software license terms to third parties, including competitors, at low or no cost, to seek licenses\nfrom third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the\nsale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nFurther, use of open‐source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third‐party\ncommercial software, as open‐source licensors generally do not provide warranties, assurances of title,\nperformance, non‐infringement, or controls on the origin of the software. Open‐source software typically lacks\nsupport, and authors of such open‐source software may abandon further development and maintenance. Open‐source\nsoftware may contain security vulnerabilities and other liabilities, and we may be subject to additional security\nrisk by using open‐source software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, but there can be\nno assurance that these processes will alleviate all risks with the open‐source software we incorporate.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract manufacturers,\nand suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to infringe upon\nthe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent or other property infringement based on allegations related to our technology.\nIf a partner were to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to\nsignificant monetary liabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku\nTV partners often involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in\ncircumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the\nclaim does not pertain to our technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually\nlimited.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic uncertainties have in the past and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties, including increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and\ncredit market fluctuations, changes in economic policy, bank failures, labor disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nglobal supply chain constraints have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact many aspects of our\nbusiness. For example, our business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both\nof which are susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as growing inflation, rising interest rates,\nrecessionary fears, and economic uncertainty. Sustained or worsening inflation or an economic downturn may result\nin fewer consumer purchases of our products or the products of our licensed Roku TV partners (which could impact\nour Active Account growth) and reduced advertising spending (which could impact our monetization efforts). We\nbelieve advertising budgets in a variety of industries have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising\ninterest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced advertiser spending, which has adversely\naffected our platform revenue. Any continued pullback in consumer discretionary spending or advertising spending\ncould adversely affect our future operating results. In addition, a significant reduction in the supply of original\nentertainment content, including as a result of macroeconomic factors or labor disputes (such as the 2023 strikes\ncalled by the Writers Guild of America and SAG‐AFTRA), could in turn reduce the demand for advertising and media\nand entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform, and have a material adverse effect on our growth\nin Active Accounts and Streaming Hours or negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact our operational and financial performance\nremains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may\nnegatively affect our business and operating results.\n40\nTable of Contents\nNatural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and\nimpact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war), terrorist attack and other geopolitical conflicts (such as Yemen’s\nHouthi attacks in the Red Sea), medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), government shutdown\norders, other man-made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our, our business partners’ and\ncustomers’ business operations or result in disruptions in the broader global economic environment. Any of these\nbusiness disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\nIn particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster.\nIn addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV\npartners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\nwildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,\nincreasing intensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power\noutages. Further, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.\nIf our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,\nour ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the\noperations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or\nother catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed\nRoku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a natural disaster or other catastrophic event and to\nexecute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,\namong others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation\nand regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations\ngoverning issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of\nproviders of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the\ninternet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing\nregulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing the reference design of TVs powered by the\nRoku OS, we were required to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing,\nmanufacturing, marketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations\nregarding the manufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and we or our licensed Roku TV\npartners may be unable to sell TVs powered by the Roku OS at all, which could harm our business and our ability to\ngrow our user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer\nprotection, children’s online protection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little\nharmonization between jurisdictions and limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and\nother government bodies that contain provisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and\nother tracking technologies to collect, use, and share user information. Certain state laws, such as the CCPA, the\nCPRA, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, also impose requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nhas laws requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from\nusers for the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In\naddition, the EU has adopted the Digital Services Act, which is legislation that updates the liability and safety\nrules for digital platforms, products, and services. The EU also recently adopted the Data Act, which seeks to\nenhance interoperability and facilitate data sharing and reuse across products and services.\n41\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory investigations and enforcement actions could also impact our business operations. For example, we and\nother companies in the media, entertainment, and advertising technology industries have been subject to government\ninvestigation by regulatory bodies with regard to our compliance with data privacy and security laws. Advocacy\norganizations have also filed complaints with data protection authorities against businesses with streaming apps\nand advertising technology, arguing that certain of these companies’ practices do not comply with the CCPA or other\nregulations. Such investigations or enforcement actions may require us to alter our practices. Further, if we or\nthe third parties that we work with, such as contract payment processing services, content partners, vendors, or\ndevelopers, violate or are alleged to violate applicable privacy or security laws, laws concerning access to data,\nindustry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such violations and alleged violations may also\nput our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business and reputation and subject us to potential\nliability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers, or content partners to lose trust in us,\nwhich could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to\nliability and reputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npartners at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”). Some\nof our content partners have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to activities\non our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties.\nIn addition, in 2019, the FTC initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection\nAct (“COPPA”), which limits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children\nunder the age of 13. Following this review, in December 2023, the FTC issued a formal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\nthat proposes specific revisions to the COPPA rule and seeks additional public input. Among other topics, the FTC\nhas proposed rule changes that would prohibit targeted advertising to children absent express opt-in consent from\nparents, strengthen data security requirements for children’s personal information, and limit the period during\nwhich children’s personal information can be retained. The review has not been concluded and could result in\nbroadening the applicability of COPPA and other changes.\nThere have also been proposals in the U.S. Congress to amend and expand COPPA. Changes to the COPPA legislation or\nrules could limit the information that we or our content partners and advertisers may collect and use and the\ncontent of advertisements in relation to certain app partner content. The CPRA and certain other state privacy laws\nalso impose certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain information about minors can be collected.\nCalifornia also has adopted a new law known as the Age Appropriate Design Code Act, which has a stated purpose of\nprotecting “the well being, data, and privacy of children using online platforms.” A federal district court in\nCalifornia granted a preliminary injunction preventing that law from going into effect during the pendency of\nlitigation challenging it on constitutional grounds, and the California Attorney General has since asked a federal\nappeals court to lift that injunction. At the same time, since adoption of the California law, similar legislation\nhas been introduced for consideration in other U.S. states. The EU and many of its member states, among other\njurisdictions, also have rules that limit processing of personal information, including children’s data, and that\nimpose specific requirements intended to protect children online. We and our content partners and advertisers could\nbe at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other privacy, advertising, children’s online\nprotection, or similar laws.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and\nother countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus, and\nthe United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions\nshould the conflict further escalate. In addition, the effects of Brexit on EU-UK political, trade, economic, and\ndiplomatic relations continue to be uncertain and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more.\nContinued uncertainty and friction may result in regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our international\noperations.\nThese and other trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, or political uncertainty can disrupt supply chains and\nincrease the cost of our and our partners’ products, and have a negative impact on consumer confidence, which could\nimpair our future growth and adversely affect our international operations, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n42\nTable of Contents\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and\nsanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within\nour complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our\nretailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls relating to such\ncompliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all\ntimes or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our\nretailers or partners. Any such potential violation by us, our retailers, or our partners could have negative\nconsequences, including government investigations, enforcement actions, monetary fines, or civil and/or criminal\npenalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.\nU.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade\nusers’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the\nprovision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. We believe that the continued\ngrowth of streaming as an entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective\nbroadband internet access (including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband\ncontent delivery, and broadband service providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content\ntraveling on their networks. Laws, regulations, or court rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in\nuse of the internet, including decisions that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, or that\ndisincentivize internet access network operators’ willingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their\nequipment, could decrease customer demand for our service offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could\ncause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations\ngoverning the provision of internet access service. Substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and\nelsewhere regarding such provisions.\nFor example, in 2015, the FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from\nunreasonably restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by\nus and our content partners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules. In September 2023, the FCC formally\nproposed to restore the 2015 open internet rules and re-establish the FCC’s role in overseeing broadband providers,\nalthough some representatives of broadband providers have already stated that they may challenge such a decision in\ncourt.\nIf network operators were to engage in restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede\nour growth, result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise\nimpair our ability to attract and retain users, any of which could harm our business. Several states and foreign\ncountries in which we operate also have adopted or are considering rules governing the provision of internet\naccess. In addition, in some jurisdictions (including the United States), network operators are pursuing proposals\nthat would require or enable them to impose fees on content providers related to delivery of network traffic.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or\napplications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce\nDirective in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The\nDMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to\nuncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that\nlimit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content\nmoderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit\nour ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of apps that are distributed on our platform.\nWhile our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the\ncopyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in\ncertain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted\ncontent. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our\nability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are unable to continue to\ncomply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an\nopinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in\nthe accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nThe generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting\nprinciples. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results\nof operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness\nof a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting\npolicies, any of which could harm our business.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our\nnoncompliance, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to litigation, claims, regulatory inquiries,\ninvestigations, and other legal proceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to\nchange our business practices in a way that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to various legal proceedings, claims, arbitration\nproceedings, and investigations and inquiries from government entities, including with regard to intellectual\nproperty, employment, consumer and data privacy, corporate governance, and commercial disputes, among other\nmatters. These matters are inherently uncertain. Any proceedings, claims, or inquiries initiated by or against us,\nwhether successful or not, may be time-consuming, subject us to damage awards, regulatory orders, consent decrees,\ninjunctive relief, fines, or other penalties or sanctions, require us to change our policies or practices, result\nin increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us to incur\nsignificant legal and other expenses. In addition, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all\nmaterial expenses related to pending and future claims. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31, 2023, Mr.\nWood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only\nowns 12.2% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our\n“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably\nbelieves to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.\nWood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely\nthis concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not\nsupport. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common\nstock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class\nA common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content partners;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nthe perception that our environmental, social, and corporate governance performance is inadequate compared to\nthat of our competitors;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or\npublic health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn addition, we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been,\nand may in the future be, subject to securities class action litigation or derivative litigation. Such litigation\ncould result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns.\n46\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year, at\nthe end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent workers\nmay also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is dilutive to\nexisting stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or\nissues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or\nmore equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail\nto comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against\nus, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, on\ncommittees of our Board, or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, any future credit agreement we enter into could contain\nprohibitions on the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of\ntheir Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future\ngains on their investments.\n47\nTable of Contents\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;\npermitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business.\n48\nTable of Contents"

Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nOur enterprise-wide approach to risk management is designed to support the achievement of our organizational and\nstrategic objectives and improve long-term organizational performance. Cybersecurity is a critical component of our\nenterprise risk management approach, and cybersecurity risks are among the enterprise risks that are subject to\noversight by our Board and the Audit Committee of our Board (the “Audit Committee”).\nOur cybersecurity program is designed to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Key\ncomponents of our cybersecurity program include:\nmanaging cybersecurity threats by deploying technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information\nsystems from cybersecurity threats, which we evaluate and seek to improve, including through vulnerability\nassessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence;\nmaintaining cybersecurity incident management procedures to address incident reporting, classification,\nescalation, response, and recovery, and facilitate efficient and consistent management of cybersecurity incidents\ninvolving our information systems;\nassessing and testing our cybersecurity policies and practices via internal efforts (such as assessments,\nvulnerability testing, threat modeling, tabletop exercises, and other exercises focused on evaluating the\neffectiveness of our cybersecurity measures) and by engaging third parties (including cybersecurity consulting\nfirms) to perform assessments of our cybersecurity measures;\na third-party cybersecurity risk management process, including, among other things, a security assessment and\ncontracting process for vendor applications and implementing contractual security measures with third-party\nvendors; and\ncybersecurity awareness training for all employees and enhanced training for certain employees.\nCybersecurity Governance\nAs part of its broader risk oversight activities, the Board oversees risks from cybersecurity threats, primarily\nthrough delegation to the Audit Committee. As reflected in its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in\nreviewing our significant cybersecurity matters and concerns. The Audit Committee engages on cybersecurity matters\nwith our management team, including our Vice President of Trust Engineering, who regularly provides presentations\nto the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity program and cybersecurity risks. These presentations address a range of\ntopics including, for example, the threat landscape and cybersecurity events, vulnerability assessments, incident\npreparedness assessments, disaster recovery plans, and cybersecurity awareness training. Two additional members of\nour Board, who have cybersecurity experience but are not members of the Audit Committee, are invited to attend\nAudit Committee meetings when review of our cybersecurity program is on the agenda. In addition, the full Board\nreceives regular updates on the activities of the Audit Committee, including with regard to cybersecurity\noversight.\nOur Vice President of Trust Engineering is principally responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity risk management\nprogram, in partnership with other members of management. Our Vice President of Trust Engineering has served in\nvarious roles in cybersecurity and information technology for over 30 years, including as Vice President and Chief\nSecurity Architect of Intertrust Technologies Corporation and Java Security Architect at Sun Microsystems, Inc.\nIn addition, our Executive Incident Management Team (“EIMT”) is a cross-functional management committee focused on\nproviding executive guidance on the cybersecurity incident response process to facilitate an appropriate and timely\nresponse, make decisions related to cybersecurity incidents, and notify appropriate parties with relevant cross-\nfunctional expertise in the event of a cybersecurity incident.\nOur Trust Engineering team is responsible for the day-to-day identification, assessment, and management of\ninformation security risks and provides regular updates to our Vice President of Trust Engineering regarding the\nprevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents are\nescalated to our Vice President of Trust Engineering, the EIMT, and the Chair of our Audit Committee in accordance\nwith our cybersecurity incident management procedures, so that decisions can be made regarding incident reporting\nand disclosure in a timely manner.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNotwithstanding our cybersecurity risk management and governance, we may not be successful in preventing or\nmitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While our business strategy,\nresults of operations, and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, we cannot provide assurance that\nthey will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more\ninformation regarding the cybersecurity risks we face, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nunder the caption “Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could\nharm our reputation, cause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and\nsubject us to liability.”"

                "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2022 and\n2021 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\nfiled with the SEC on February 16, 2023.\nOverview\nOur two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video advertising, media and entertainment\npromotional spending, and related services) and streaming services distribution (including subscription and\ntransaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote\ncontrols). Streaming services distribution was previously referred to as content distribution services.\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs (beginning in March 2023), smart\nhome products and services, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements\nwith service operators. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices of Roku streaming devices to\nincrease our Active Accounts. We expect that the trade off from devices gross profit or loss to grow Active\nAccounts will result in increased platform revenue and platform gross profit.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as part of our continuing evaluation of our operations, we\ndetermined to implement additional measures to continue to bring down our year-over-year operating expense growth\nrate by consolidating our office space utilization, performing a strategic review of our content portfolio,\nreducing outside services expenses, and slowing our year-over-year headcount expense growth rate through a series\nof workforce reductions and limiting new hires, among other measures. We recorded a total restructuring charge of\n$356.1 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of these actions. See Note 17 to the\nconsolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details.\nBusiness Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit\nmarket fluctuations, changes in economic policy, global supply chain constraints, and geopolitical developments\n(such as the war in Ukraine and the unrest in the Middle East), have had, and we believe may continue to have, an\nimpact on our business and results of operations. We believe that advertisers in a variety of industries reduce\ntheir overall advertising spend when they are impacted by these factors, which in turn adversely affects our\nplatform revenue. Higher inflation and economic uncertainty also lead to a reduction in consumer discretionary\nspending, which impacts our devices revenue. We believe that the direct and indirect impacts of these business\nconditions and macroeconomic factors are difficult to isolate or quantify. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Note\nRegarding Forward Looking Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details.\n53\nTable of Contents\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, Active Accounts, Streaming Hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nActive Accounts as they stream content on our platform. All of our gross profit is generated from our platform\nsegment.\nOur gross profit was $1,522.6 million and $1,441.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, reflecting an increase of 6%.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of Active Accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nActive Accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. Additionally, users who only register an account for use of one of our smart home products are not\nincluded in our reported number of Active Accounts. The number of Active Accounts also does not correspond to the\nnumber of unique individuals who actively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an\naccount. For example, an Active Account may include more than one individual, such as a family, and one Active\nAccount may include use of multiple Roku streaming devices.\nWe had 80.0 million and 70.0 million Active Accounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting an\nincrease of 14%.\nStreaming Hours\nWe believe the number of Streaming Hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define Streaming Hours as the aggregate amount of time Roku streaming\ndevices stream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku\nplatforms are not included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our Streaming\nHours. We report Streaming Hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content partners is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming apps, and the number of Streaming Hours\ndoes not correlate to revenue earned from such content partners or ARPU on a period-by-period basis. Moreover,\nStreaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming app may\ncontinue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming app. We believe that this also occurs\nacross a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to\nidentify when content has been continuously streaming on an app for an extended period of time without user\ninteraction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm\nthat they are still watching the selected app and closes the app if the user does not respond affirmatively. We\nbelieve that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our customers, content\npartners, and advertisers. Some of our leading content partners, including Netflix, also have implemented similar\nfeatures within their apps. This Roku OS feature supplements these app features. This feature has not had and is\nnot expected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nWe streamed 106.0 billion and 87.4 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nreflecting an increase of 21%.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of Active Accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our Active Accounts base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $39.92 as of December 31, 2023 as compared to $41.68 as of December 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease of 4%.\nThe decrease in ARPU is due to an increasing share of Active Accounts in international markets where we are\ncurrently focused on growing scale and engagement, rather than monetization of our streaming platform.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls). Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in\nThe Roku Channel, native display ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well as ad inventory we obtain through\nour streaming services distribution agreements with our content partners.

The remaining increase was driven primarily\nby the sales of Roku-branded TVs introduced in March 2023 and to a lesser extent by the sales of smart home\nproducts, partially offset by lower revenue from sales of streaming players. The volume of streaming players sold\ndecreased by 8% and the average selling price of streaming players increased by 1% during the year ended December\n31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of Revenue:                                             2023            2022       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 1,427,546    $  1,179,675    $   247,871          21  %\nDevices                                                   534,458         505,737         28,721           6  %\nTotal cost of revenue                 $                 1,962,004    $  1,685,412    $   276,592          16  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                              $                 1,566,559    $  1,531,766    $    34,793           2  %\nDevices                                                   -43,944         -90,644         46,700         -52  %\nTotal gross profit                    $                 1,522,615    $  1,441,122    $    81,493           6  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of revenue, platform increased by $247.9 million, or 21%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase was primarily driven by higher manufacturing costs of $8.7\nmillion, higher royalties of $8.6 million, higher inventory provision of $2.2 million, and higher other device\nrelated costs such as product warranties and overhead cost allocation of $9.3 million, offset by lower freight\ncosts of $3.5 million. The increase in manufacturing costs was driven primarily by the cost of Roku-branded TVs\nthat we began selling in March 2023 and the cost of smart home products. The cost of revenue, devices also includes\nrestructuring charges of $3.3 million that consist of employee severance, facilities exit costs, and asset\nimpairments.\nGross loss for the devices segment decreased by $46.7 million, or 52%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase was driven by the increases in foreign taxes primarily due to the increase of\ntaxable earnings in our foreign operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,025.9 million. Approximately 4% of our cash was\nheld outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign\noperations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue. The primary uses of cash are costs of\nrevenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party\nmanufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses such as personnel-related expenses including\nemployee termination payments, consulting and professional service expenses, facility expenses, and marketing\nexpenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.\nWe have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition\nactivities in the future, including the acquisition of rights to programming and content assets. Though we do not\nexpect to incur expenses for facilities and building related costs at the same level as the last few fiscal years,\nwe will continue to incur expenses on the maintenance of our facilities and purchases of computer systems, and\nother property and equipment, in order to support future growth in our business. These activities may materially\nimpact our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital\nexpenditures, and material cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and\nbeyond. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be\naffected by various risks, uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in\nthis Annual Report and the effects of the current macroeconomic environment. While the current macroeconomic\nenvironment has not severely impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption\nand volatility in local economies and in capital and credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and\ncapital resources in the future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we\nraise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and\nalso to restrictive covenants. Additionally, due to the current macroeconomic environment, we may be unable to\nobtain debt or equity financing on terms that are acceptable to us.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (as amended on\nMay 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provided for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan\nA facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\nOn November 18, 2019, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million from the Term Loan A Facility. We\nelected an interest rate equal to the adjusted one-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our\nsecured leverage ratio. The Credit Facility matured on February 19, 2023 and the outstanding Term Loan A Facility\nwas repaid in full.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit against the Revolving Credit Facility of $37.7\nmillion. Upon maturity of the Credit Facility on February 19, 2023, the outstanding letters of credit were secured\nby our existing cash balance, a portion of which is restricted for that purpose. As of December 31, 2023, we had\noutstanding letters of credit of $37.5 million, which are secured by restricted cash of $40.7 million.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details.\n60\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2023           2022\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   255,856    $    11,795\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                   -92,619    $  -201,696\nCash flows (used in) provided by           $                   -61,243    $     8,357\nfinancing activities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $255.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The cash outflow related\nprimarily to the repayment of $80.0 million of our Credit Facility that became due in February 2023 offset by $18.8\nmillion received from proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of:\nCommitments to purchase finished goods from our contract manufacturers and other inventory related items.\nConsistent with industry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with\nour contract manufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\nopen orders based on projected demand information. Our contract manufacturers source components and build our\nproducts based on these demand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our\nproducts may result in us being committed to purchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments. For additional\ninformation regarding manufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to license content from content partners and produce content under contractual arrangements. For\nadditional information regarding content commitments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item\n8 of this Annual Report.\nOperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and liabilities related to the\nlease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease liabilities, see\nNote 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our restructuring efforts to\nconsolidate office space did not materially change our operating lease obligations.\nThe contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.\nIn addition, we have $6.2 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023. We adjust these positions\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. We are\nunable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. Although we believe we have\nadequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these\nmatters will not be materially different.\n61\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable\nat the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nJudgment may be required in determining whether products contain multiple distinct performance obligations and\nwhether each should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation\nbased on its relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). Our process for determining SSP requires judgment. For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, we consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending\nupon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. We determine SSP based on prices\ncharged to customers for individual products, taking into consideration other factors, which may include (i)\nhistorical and expected discounting practices, (ii) the size, and volume of transactions, (iii) the geographic\nareas in which our products are sold, and (iv) our overall go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations\nthat are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen arrangements have variable consideration, we utilize the expected value method to estimate the amount expected\nto be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained to\nthe extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not\noccur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment of historical,\ncurrent, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nThe transaction price in some of our arrangements include non-cash consideration. We determine the fair value of\nnon-cash consideration at contract inception by using historical internal and observable third-party data.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur devices revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price.\nAmortization of Content Assets\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected monetization of such\ncontent which results in accelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Judgment is\nrequired to determine the amortization patterns of our content assets which are monetized as a group. Critical\njudgments include: (i) the predominant monetization strategy of content, (ii) the grouping of content with similar\ncharacteristics, and (iii) the application of historical viewership model and projected decay. These judgments and\nunderlying analysis are reviewed regularly and adjusted as needed on a prospective basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets with\nfinite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nto which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances indicate an asset or asset group’s\ncarrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net\ncash flows directly associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group against their\nrespective carrying amounts. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\n62\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $131.6 million for operating lease\nright-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $72.3 million for property and equipment related to a decision to\nsub-lease and cease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. The impairment was a\nresult of the restructuring efforts announced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. See Note 17 for additional\ndetails. There were no impairments of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets with\nfinite lives during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nSignificant judgments and estimates included in the determination of the fair value of the assets were\nidentification of events or changes in circumstances necessitating an impairment assessment, the expected downtime\nprior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and\ndiscount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nOur accounts receivable is stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical\nexperience, promotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual\nresults, the losses or gains could be material.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset\nand liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nIn determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess both positive and negative evidence in the various\njurisdictions to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are recoverable. We\nregularly assess all available evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings. A valuation\nallowance is established when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance for our U.S. and Netherlands net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty\nof realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. A change\nin the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact our tax provision in the period\nin which a change of assessment occurs. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of U.S.\nfederal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release\nis recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements are discussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements\nin Item 8 of this Annual Report. They are incorporated herein by reference."

                "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash and cash equivalents. The\nprimary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly\nincreasing risk. We believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points on our cash and cash\nequivalents balance would impact our interest income by an additional increase or decrease of $20.7 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related\nto our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances and lease\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of\ncurrent and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not entered into any derivatives or\nother financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the\nfuture.\n63\nTable of Contents"

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination in Streaming Services Distribution – Refer to Note 2 to\nthe financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content partners, management is required to\nestimate variable consideration from transactional revenue sharing related to streaming services distribution.\nVariable consideration related to streaming services distribution (“content partner arrangements”) is included in\nthe estimated transaction price based on the expected value for which a significant reversal of revenue is not\nexpected to occur. For streaming services distribution, the estimate of the variable consideration is based on\nmanagement’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted performance of the partner’s applications.\nWe identified the forecasts of variable consideration relating to streaming service distribution as a critical\naudit matter due to the significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration. Such estimates required\na high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\n65\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to streaming services\ndistribution.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\n◦ Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\n◦ Analyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for transactional revenue sharing.\n◦ Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for streaming services distribution.\n◦ Tested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\n◦ Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\n◦ Tested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\n◦ We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to partners’ content applications\nas well as our observations and inquiries as to the changes within the business and considerations of macroeconomic\nand industry factors.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose,

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and\nprogrammatic video advertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming\nservices distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions,\nand the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls). Streaming services distribution was previously referred to\nas content distribution services. The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-\nbranded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from\nlicensing arrangements with service operators.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Certain prior period amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\nthe impairment of intangible assets;\namortization and the impairment of content assets;\nthe impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment;\nvaluation of the Strategic Investment (defined in Note 7);\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 includes foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and\nliabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at exchange rates in\neffect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue\nand expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or\nlosses from remeasurement and transaction gains or losses are recorded as Other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $ 1.5million, a gain of $\n8.2million, and a loss of $ 1.2million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also has some foreign subsidiaries which use local currency as their functional currency. The financial\nstatements of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposit accounts\nand investments in money market funds.\nThe Company’s restricted cash balance is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and is used to secure outstanding letters of credit related to operating leases for office\nfacilities. The letters of credit were previously secured by the Credit Facility (defined in Note 10) which matured\nand was repaid in February 2023. See Note 10 for additional details.\nThe Company maintains its cash, cash equivalent, and restricted cash balances with high credit financial\ninstitutions and continuously monitors the amount of exposure to any one institution and diversifies as necessary\nin order to minimize its concentration risk. Such balances often exceed regulated insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consisted of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nBeginning balance                    $                     7,417    $    6,015    $    5,912\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   16,560        19,068        16,181\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -16,169       -17,666       -16,078\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     7,808    $    7,417    $    6,015\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023           2022          2021\nBeginning balance                       $                    28,903    $    48,411    $   30,838\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                      85,178         94,731        90,530\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                        -91,057       -114,239       -72,957\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    23,024    $    28,903    $   48,411\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023        2022         2021\nBeginning balance                         $                     3,498    $  2,158    $   4,181\nProvision for (recoveries of) doubtful                          1,674       2,081         -904\naccounts\nAdjustments for write-off                                      -2,959        -741       -1,119\nEnding balance                            $                     2,213    $  3,498    $   2,158\nThe Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net\nbalance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n74\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment at least annually\nduring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill or\nindefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes\nin the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate that it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived-intangible asset is less than its carrying value. In performing\nits annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test for impairment or it can\ndirectly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s qualitative assessment, if it is determined that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets is, more likely than not, less than its\ncarrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount\nover its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit. Any excess of an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying amount over its fair value is\nrecorded as an impairment loss.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets\nwith finite lives for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of an asset or asset\ngroup based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with their use and eventual\ndisposition. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess\nof the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill in any of the periods reported. The Company recorded an\nimpairment charge related to abandoned technology assets of $ 7.5million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThere were noimpairments of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2021. See\nNote 17 for additional details.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 131.6million for\noperating lease right-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $ 72.3million for property and equipment related to\na decision to sub-lease and cease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. This\naction was taken as part of the restructuring announced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. See Note 17 for\nadditional details. There were noimpairments of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets\nwith finite lives during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nContent Assets\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as Content assets, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. For licensed content, the cost per title is capitalized along with a corresponding liability when the\nlicense period begins, the content is available for streaming and when the fee is determinable. For produced\ncontent, all direct production costs are capitalized. Payment terms for certain licensed content require advanced\npayments which are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage which results in\naccelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Projected usage is mainly based on\nhistorical and projected viewing patterns. Amortization of content assets is included in Cost of revenue, platform\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nContent assets (licensed and produced) are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less than the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether\nthe film group is impaired. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be,\nabandoned are written off. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of\n$ 65.5million related to removing select licensed and produced content from The Roku Channel. This action was taken\nas part of the restructuring announced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. See Note 17 for additional\ndetails. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n75\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the\npromised goods or services in the contract which may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the\ninception of each arrangement, the Company evaluates the likelihood that the payments will be collected. When\narrangements have variable consideration, the Company utilizes the expected value method to estimate the amount\nexpected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is\nconstrained to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on prices charged to customers\nfor individual products in consideration with historical and expected discounting practices, the size, and volume\nof transactions, geographic location, and go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations that are not\nroutinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen the Company’s arrangements involve third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the\nprincipal, and reports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this\nassessment, the Company considers if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are\ntransferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment,\ninventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies or third-party demand\nand supply-side platforms and to content partners for their media and entertainment promotions via various campaign\ntools. Advertising arrangements include video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions.\nAdvertising arrangements include multiple performance obligations as they contain distinct advertising products or\nservices. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on\ntheir relative SSP. The Company also generates revenue from customers using its advertising platform. For such\narrangements, it charges a platform fee, which is a percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory spend during\nthe month, along with data and any add-on features purchased through the platform. The Company recognizes revenue\non either a gross or net basis for digital advertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the\nprincipal in the revenue generation process or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being\nprimarily responsible to its customers for the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing\npricing. Advertising arrangements comprised of multiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in\ntime or over time depending on the nature of the distinct performance obligation.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s revenue sharing arrangements within its streaming services distribution include cash or non-cash\nconsideration. The revenue sharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for\nnew services and at the time of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is\ndeemed to be the agent between content partners and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by\nday, as the services are delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the\nform of advertising inventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party\ndata.\nThe Company sells Premium Subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded app buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to a\ncontent partner’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nDevices segment:\nThe Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service\noperators.\nThe Company sells the majority of its devices in the U.S. through retailers and distributors as well as through the\nCompany’s website. Devices revenue primarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and\nupdates on a when and if-available basis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified\nupgrades and updates are available to customers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated\nvalue of the unspecified upgrades and updates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as devices revenue ratably on a\ntime elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the associated products.\nThe Company’s devices revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in devices revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\ndevices.\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to service operators. The revenue allocated to\nunspecified upgrades and updates is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nProfessional services revenue is recognized as services are provided or accepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a\ntime elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The\nCompany takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental\nborrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term,\nwhen it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\n77\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on its assessment of future demand and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between eighteen monthsand five years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from oneto eleven years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company did notcapitalize any internal-use software\ndevelopment costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company capitalized internal-use software\ndevelopment costs of $ 0.5million. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life of the asset, which is generally twoto three years, beginning when the asset is ready for its\nintended use. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company amortized internal-use software\ndevelopment costs of $ 0.9million, $ 1.0million, and $ 1.0million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of devices revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, and advance payments from advertisers, content partners, and\nlicensing or services fees received from service operators and TV brands, where performance obligations are not yet\nfulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as a current liability and the\nremaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses are recognized when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $ 3.7million, $ 10.0million,\nand $ 35.2million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted, in absence of its own\nhistorical exercise data.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatility of the Company’s\nClass A common stock price and the stock price volatilities of several peer companies which are similar in size\nand/or operational and economic activities.\n78\nTable of Contents\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of the Company’s stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)\n2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , that requires companies\nto provide enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses within its reportable segment disclosures on an\nannual and interim basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance applies retrospectively to all prior\nperiods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of\nthe new guidance.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ,\nthat requires incremental disclosures within the income tax disclosures that increase the transparency and\nusefulness of income tax disclosures. The updated disclosures primarily require specific categories and greater\ndisaggregation within the rate reconciliation, disaggregation of income taxes paid, and modifying other income tax-\nrelated disclosures.

Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $ 47.6million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 1,195.9million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 47% over the next 12months and the\nremainder thereafter.\nThe Company recognized $ 45.5million and reversed $ 3.2million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in\nthe estimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nCustomer I accounted for 11% of the total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents including restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $ 1,431.4million and $\n608.4million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company measured the Strategic Investment using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the\nStrategic Investment on the date of purchase was determined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company\nrecorded an unrealized gain of $ 4.3million and an unrealized loss of $ 0.5million in Other income, net related to\nthe change in the fair value of the Strategic Investment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe Company classified the Strategic Investment as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over\nfair value inputs. The fair value of the Strategic Investment was estimated using a scenario-based probability\nweighted discounted cash flow model. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and\nprobability weighting of the various redemption scenarios that impact the settlement of the Strategic Investment.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded total impairment charges of $ 269.4million that\nincluded $ 131.6million of operating lease right-of-use assets impairment, $ 72.3million of property and equipment\nimpairment, and $ 65.5million of content assets impairment related to removing select licensed and produced content\nfrom The Roku Channel.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million related to the\nabandonment of future development of certain technology assets. The Company did notrecord any impairment charges\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe fair value of the impaired operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment were estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow models, or the income approach, based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs.\nThe significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement\nof future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect\nthe level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows. For the licensed and produced content that was\nremoved from The Roku Channel, the net carrying amount of the content assets was written off. For the abandoned\ntechnology assets, the net carrying amount of the technology assets was written off.\n9. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate. The leases have remaining terms\nranging from less than 1year to 10years and may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The depreciable\nlife of ROU assets is limited by the expected lease term.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023         2022         2021\nOperating lease expense          $                    83,060    $  76,359    $  46,410\nVariable lease expense                                23,331       18,991       15,080\nTotal operating lease expense    $                   106,391    $  95,350    $  61,490\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in thousands):\nCash paid for amounts included in the          Years Ended December 31,\nmeasurement of lease liabilities:                                  2023          2022          2021\nOperating cash outflows from operating      $                    74,278    $   56,370    $   51,657\nleases\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange\nfor lease obligations:\nOperating leases                            $                    40,866    $  231,728    $  110,845\nDecrease in operating lease right-of-use    $                   131,646    $        —    $        —\nassets due to impairment (See Note 17)\n85\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease term and\ndiscount rate):\nAs of December 31,\n2023                2022\nOperating lease right-of-use assets       $             371,444          $  521,695\nOperating lease liability, current                       68,099              54,689\n(included in Accrued liabilities)\nOperating lease liability, non-current                  586,174             584,651\nTotal operating lease liability           $             654,273          $  639,340\nWeighted-average remaining term for                              7.94                8.62\noperating leases (in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate for                         3.94     %          3.80     %\noperating leases\nFuture lease payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,                          Operating Leases\n2024                                                        89,751\n2025                                                        98,702\n2026                                                       100,237\n2027                                                        99,686\n2028                                                       100,099\nThereafter                                                 282,716\nTotal future lease payments                                771,191\nLess: imputed interest                                    -110,068\nLess: expected tenant improvement allowance                 -6,850\nTotal(1)                                       $           654,273\n(1) Total lease liabilities include liabilities related to operating lease right-of-use assets which were included\nin the impairment charges as part of the Company’s restructuring efforts.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.\nIn order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and\nsuppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-\ncancelable. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 131.5million of non-cancelable purchase commitments for\ninventory.\nContent Commitments\nThe Company enters into contracts with content partners to license and produce content for streaming. When a title\nbecomes available, the Company records a content asset and liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain\nlicensing agreements, such as film output deals, include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles\nfor which the ultimate quantity and/or fees are not determinable as of the reporting date. The Company does not\ninclude any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. The unknown obligations\ncould be material. The Company also licenses content under arrangements where the payments are variable and based\non the revenue earned by the Company. Since those amounts cannot be determined, they are not included in the\nobligations below.\n89\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s total obligation for licensed and produced content is $ 286.1million, of\nwhich the Company recorded $ 59.2million in Current liabilities and $ 24.1million in Other long-term liabilities in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The remaining $ 202.8million is not yet recognized on the consolidated balance\nsheets as the content does not meet the criteria for asset recognition.\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,\n2024                            184,716\n2025                             62,655\n2026                             21,971\n2027                             12,732\n2028                              1,436\nThereafter                        2,568\nTotal content liabilities    $  286,078\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $\n37.5million and $ 37.7million, respectively, related to facilities leases. The letters of credit have various\nexpiration dates through 2030.\nContingencies\nThe Company accounts for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing and other\nclaims, when it believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. These contingencies are reviewed at\nleast quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel, and other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal\nproceedings can be, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course\nof business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices, and patent infringement. The\nCompany is involved in proceedings, claims and investigations not listed herein. Although the results of these\nproceedings, claims, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the\nfinal outcome of any matters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, the Company did not have any loss contingencies that were material.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n90\nTable of Contents\n13.

Due to\nthis required capitalization of research and development expenses, the Company has recorded U.S. current income tax\nexpense of $ 3.7million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized through future operations. As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2023, the Company believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a\nfull valuation allowance against its U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 166.0million and $ 199.2million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is primarily\nattributable to an increase in deferred tax assets generated through capitalization of section 174 research and\ndevelopment expenses for U.S. federal and conforming state purposes.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,807.3million and $ 1,604.0million are available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2037, and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2023.\nFor Brazil, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n8.6million, $ 47.6million, and $ 14.0million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable income, if any.\nBrazil and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be\ncarried back one year and carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 194.7million and $\n149.5million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2030 and 2039, respectively.\n92\nTable of Contents\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 is $ 88.5million, of which $ 71.8million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 16.7million is related to international activities.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023         2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              88,028    $  66,150\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        13,166       22,888\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                      -54         -317\nGross increase for tax positions of                           140          676\nprior years\nGross decrease for tax positions of                       -12,689       -1,185\nprior years\nDecrease relating to settlements with                         -43         -184\ntaxing authorities\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              88,548    $  88,028\nof year\nAs of December 31, 2023, $ 5.2million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect\nthe effective tax rate and $ 83.3million would result in an adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding\nadjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change\nsignificantly within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. The Company recorded $ 1.0million and $ 0.8million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and certain\nforeign jurisdictions. All tax years remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits\ninclude questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and\ncompliance with federal, state, and local tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Act, the Company has not\nprovided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes, state income tax or\nforeign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of unrecognized tax\nexpense on these reinvested international earnings.\n14. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. NoCompany contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nThe Company has defined contribution plans in the U.K. and Korea for the employees in those countries. The Company\ncontributed $ 3.2million, $ 2.3million, and $ 1.3million in total to these plans for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n93\nTable of Contents\n15. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to\ncalculate net income (loss) per share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and\nas otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by\napplicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic\nand diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, options to purchase common stock and\nrestricted stock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by\napplying the treasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per\nshare in the period of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as follows (in\nthousands, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                         2023                    2022                   2021\nNet income (loss)           $                  -709,561             $  -498,005             $  242,385\nDenominator:\nBasic net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                   141,572                 137,668                132,710\noutstanding — basic\nNet income (loss) per       $                     -5.01             $     -3.62             $     1.83\nshare — basic\nDiluted net income\n(loss) per share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                   141,572                 137,668                132,710\noutstanding — basic\nEffect of potentially\ndilutive\nsecurities:\nRestricted stock units                                —                       —                  2,744\nStock options                                         —                       —                  6,214\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                   141,572                 137,668                141,668\noutstanding — diluted\nNet income (loss) per       $                     -5.01             $     -3.62             $     1.71\nshare — diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because of their\nanti-dilutive effect were 14.0million, 14.4million and 1.1million units of equity awards to purchase common stock\ngranted under the Company’s equity plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n94\nTable of Contents\n16. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the\nmanagement approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented\nseparately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the\nmanner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating\nresources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does not\nallocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nDescriptions of the Company’s tworeportable segments are as follows:\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue is generated from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nDevices\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service\noperators.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023       2022       2021\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                            *          *      10  %\nCustomer I                                        13  %          *          *\nDevices segment revenue\nCustomer A                                        15  %          *          *\nCustomer B                                        15  %      21  %      22  %\nCustomer C                                        41  %      38  %      35  %\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.\nLong-lived assets, net\nThe following table presents long-lived assets, net, which consist primarily of property and equipment and\noperating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023          2022\nUnited States      $             497,024    $  686,902\nUnited Kingdom                   109,315       127,538\nOther countries                   29,661        42,286\nTotal              $             636,000    $  856,726\n95\nTable of Contents\n17. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nThe Company began efforts to reduce its operating expense growth rate due to economic conditions in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2022. The Company recorded employee termination expenses, and an impairment charge related to\nabandoned technology assets during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company implemented additional measures including consolidating its\noffice space utilization, performing a strategic review of its content portfolio, reducing outside services\nexpenses, and slowing its year-over-year headcount expense growth rate through a workforce reduction and limiting\nnew hires, among other measures. As a result of these measures, the Company recorded restructuring charges\nassociated with employee termination expenses consisting primarily of severance payments, employee benefits\ncontributions, payroll taxes and related costs, impairment charges related to decisions to sub-lease and cease the\nuse of certain office facilities and related property and equipment, and impairment charges related to removing\nselect licensed and produced content from The Roku Channel.\nThe restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are recorded as follows (in thousands):\nYear                                                         Year\nEnded                                                        Ended\nDecember                                                     December\n31,                                                          31,\n2023                                                         2022\nEmployee       Faciliti…          Asset                      Employee          Asset\nTermina…            Exit       Impairm…         Total       Terminat…       Impairm…        Total\nCosts        Charges                                      Charges\nCost of\nrevenu…    $     1,164    $          1    $    65,867    $   67,032    $          —    $         —    $       —\nplatfo…\nCost of\nrevenu…            524               6          2,793         3,323               —              —            —\ndevices\nResear…\nand             31,160           1,320         78,011       110,491          12,092          7,500       19,592\ndevelo…\nSales\nand             29,786             517         83,411       113,714          10,904              —       10,904\nmarket…\nGeneral\nand             20,531           1,683         39,320        61,534           7,644              —        7,644\nadmini…\nTotal\nrestru…    $    83,165    $      3,527    $   269,402    $  356,094    $     30,640    $     7,500    $  38,140\ncharges\nThe asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2023 include $ 131.6million of operating lease right-\nof-use assets impairment, $ 72.3million of property and equipment impairment, and $ 65.5million of content assets\nimpairment.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nherein.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\n97\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 16, 2024\n98\nTable of Contents"

                "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico by hours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV and believe that all TV will be streamed. The shift of the TV ecosystem to\nstreaming continues and is expanding TV’s capabilities for viewers, content partners, advertisers, and other\nindustry participants. Nearly every major media company not only has a streaming service, but has also expanded\nbeyond pure subscription streaming models to ad-supported streaming options. Advertisers use TV streaming to reach\nviewers who are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV, while also benefiting from the digital advertising\ncapabilities that TV streaming platforms can deliver.\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nviewers, content partners, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we connect viewers to the\nentertainment they love; enable content partners to build, engage, and monetize large audiences; and provide\nadvertisers with unique capabilities to reach viewers.\nOur Strategy and Business Model\nThe foundation of our platform is the Roku TV OS, which is purpose built for TVs and powers Roku streaming devices.\nThe Roku TV OS is designed to run on low-cost hardware, which enables Roku streaming devices to be sold to\nconsumers at competitive prices. The Roku TV OS connects viewers to our streaming platform via a broadband network,\ngiving them access to a wide selection of content through an experience that is both delightful and easy to use. We\nprovide periodic updates via the Roku TV OS to continuously deliver an exceptional streaming experience.\nWe dedicate significant resources to build, maintain, and advance the Roku TV OS; to provide an industry-leading\nstreaming platform for our viewers, content partners, and advertisers; to obtain content for our streaming platform\nthat attracts viewers, including our own original programming (Roku Originals); and to extend Roku’s leadership as\nthe global shift to TV streaming continues.\nOur three-phased business model—grow scale, grow engagement, and grow monetization—drives our mission. We leverage\nour position as the TV streaming platform to help our viewers find content across the streaming universe, while\nsimultaneously growing monetization. Our three key initiatives to grow platform revenue are to innovate the Roku\nHome Screen to expand monetization, grow advertising demand through deeper third-party platform integrations, and\ngrow Roku-billed subscriptions.\nDevices Segment: Providing Easy Access to TV Streaming\nWe make TV streaming accessible to consumers through a broad lineup of devices, at a variety of competitive price\npoints. Our devices segment generates revenue from the sale of Roku streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home\nproducts and services, audio products, and related accessories.\nRoku TV models are TVs made and sold by our Roku TV partners, which are TV original equipment manufacturers\n(“OEMs”) that license the Roku TV OS and leverage our smart TV reference designs. We have driven strong Streaming\nHousehold growth through this Roku TV licensing program, which we launched more than 10 years ago.\nIn 2023, we launched Roku-branded TVs, which are designed, made, and sold by us. This award-winning lineup includes\nthe Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs, and the Roku Pro Series TVs, which are our higher-performing TVs that we\nlaunched in spring 2024. Roku-branded TVs complement our successful Roku TV licensing program. We believe our Roku-\nbranded TVs will enable us to further grow our leadership position in TV streaming and compete in the higher-end\nrange of performance TVs. Roku-branded TVs will also help us innovate more quickly in all aspects of hardware and\nsoftware and test directly with viewers, improving the product and viewer experience and strengthening the entire\nRoku ecosystem.\nRoku streaming players enable users to easily turn (nearly) any TV into a smart TV. We launch new streaming player\nmodels periodically with a focus on offering high performance at an affordable price. In September 2024, we\nlaunched our most powerful streaming player to date: the 2024 Roku Ultra. This premium streaming player comes\nbundled with the Voice Remote Pro (2nd edition), our most advanced remote.\nRoku streaming devices are broadly distributed at popular national retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, CVS,\nThe Home Depot, Lowe’s, Sam’s Club, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart.\n1\nTable of Contents\nAudio is an important part of the TV streaming experience, and we offer Roku-branded wireless speakers and\nsubwoofers that seamlessly connect to TVs powered by the Roku TV OS. Additionally, Roku TV Ready allows certified\nsoundbars to quickly and easily connect to Roku TVs, enabling the use of one remote and having all the sound\nsettings uploaded to the TV. This is another example of Roku’s innovative TV ecosystem.\nThe Roku ecosystem extends beyond TV streaming and audio to smart home devices that include cameras, video\ndoorbells, lights, plugs, a home monitoring system, and our Roku Smart Home mobile application for iOS and Android.\nSimilar to our TV streaming business model, we build scale by selling Roku Smart Home devices and then monetize\nthrough smart home services. We offer subscription plans for our cameras, video doorbells, and home monitoring\nsystem.\nThrough our streaming devices and the Roku platform, we provide viewers tremendous choice, value, and an\nexceptional viewer experience. In 2024, we added 9.8 million net Streaming Households, ending the year with 89.8\nmillion Streaming Households.\nPlatform Segment: Growing and Monetizing User Engagement\nThe Roku Experience\nWe call the user experience on the Roku platform the “Roku Experience.” It represents all the features that Roku\nbuilds and operates to engage, delight, and help our viewers find great entertainment. A key competitive advantage\nthat continues to drive our success is the combination of our significant scale and the Roku Experience, which\nbegins with the Roku Home Screen. The Roku Home Screen is the first thing our viewers see when they start\nstreaming, and from this position, we can help the viewer decide what to watch every day across the vast range of\noptions available to them on our streaming platform.\nAs an example, sports is an important entertainment category for viewers and advertisers, and Roku is focused on\nbenefiting from its ongoing shift to streaming. Available from the Roku Home Screen Menu, the Roku Sports Zone\norganizes sports programming in a single location, and its features are integrated throughout the Roku Experience.\nWe partnered with the NFL to launch our first league-branded zone in 2023, and in 2024 we added zones for the NBA\nand MLB. We also have zones for college football, college basketball, and women’s sports, among others. Each zone\nhelps viewers find live and upcoming games and related content such as previews, highlights, commentary, and\ndocumentaries. In addition to sports, we build viewer experiences around popular entertainment genres like home\nimprovement and food and tentpole events like the Olympics and the Oscars.\nThe Roku Channel\nAnother top engagement driver on our streaming platform is The Roku Channel, our owned and operated streaming app.\nThe Roku Channel aggregates a broad variety of entertainment into a unified streaming experience, through three\ndistinct types of content:\nAVOD (ad-supported video on demand): Viewers can stream a broad variety of 80,000+ movies and TV shows, including\nRoku Originals, for free.\nLive TV : Viewers have access to watch 500+ FAST (free, ad-supported linear streaming TV) channels in genres\nranging from news to sports to entertainment to creator content.\nPremium Subscriptions : Viewers can easily sign up, view, and manage subscriptions to dozens of SVOD apps, such\nas Max and Paramount+, with a single, monthly bill.\nThe foundation of our content strategy for The Roku Channel is third-party licensed content and, to a smaller\nextent, our original programming, Roku Originals. Our content spend is intended to be commensurate with the growth\ntrajectory of The Roku Channel and with the broader macroeconomic environment. The Roku Channel is available on\ndevices powered by the Roku TV OS in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. In the United\nStates, it is also available via the Roku mobile app, online at TheRokuChannel.Roku.com, and on Amazon Fire TVs,\nSamsung TVs, Google TV, and other Android TV OS devices.\nOwning and operating both The Roku Channel and our streaming platform creates unique value, making us a leader in\nfree content, positioning us to be a valuable partner to content partners, and providing a large source of\nadvertising inventory. The Roku Channel benefits from its integration throughout the Roku Experience, which has\nfeatures such as Live TV, Sports, What to Watch, and more that can surface content to our viewers directly. The\nRoku Channel is a core strategic asset in our monetization efforts that simultaneously benefits viewers, content\npartners, and advertisers, while generating platform revenue.\nStreaming Hours\nWe grew Streaming Hours on the overall Roku platform from 106.0 billion hours in 2023 to 127.1 billion hours in\n2024 through increasing the distribution of Roku streaming devices, increasing our Streaming Households, and\ncontinuing to enhance the Roku Experience. We are always seeking new ways to innovate to expand the role the Roku\nExperience can play in helping viewers find what to watch, which simultaneously benefits our content partners and\nadvertisers while creating monetization opportunities for Roku.\n2\nTable of Contents\nPlatform Revenue\nOur TV streaming platform enables content partners and advertisers to reach audiences that are increasingly\nunreachable on traditional TV. Each user on our streaming platform creates multiple revenue opportunities for Roku\nthrough activities such as navigating through the Roku Experience, watching ad-supported content, or signing up for\nsubscription services.\nWe generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls).\nWe empower viewers to choose how much they want to spend on content by offering them a broad array of free, ad-\nsupported, subscription, and transactional viewing options. Our direct relationship with customers provides us with\ninsights about their behavior on our streaming platform, including certain content viewers search for, the apps\nviewers install and watch, and the types of content that viewers purchase or subscribe to on our streaming\nplatform. This first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content recommendations to\nimprove our viewers’ experience.\nIn 2024, we added a new personalized content row powered by AI to the Roku Home Screen. Unlike suggestions from\nstreaming services, which are restricted to their libraries, our recommendations include content from streaming\napps across our platform. This content row is designed to recommend TV shows and movies to viewers while\nsimultaneously driving growth for Roku in areas such as Streaming Hours, SVOD signups, and ad reach.\nOur significant scale, ability to reach highly engaged viewers, tools that enable seamless signups, and\nmarketing/discovery features make us an attractive platform to content partners. They can also reach and engage\nthose viewers who do not use traditional TV services. As more viewers shift to TV streaming, content partners that\npublish apps on our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage viewers directly.\nWe make it easy for content partners to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary\nbusiness models: SVOD, which includes subscriptions to individual video on demand apps and so-called virtual\nmultichannel video programming distribution (“vMVPD”) services; ad-supported video, which includes AVOD apps with\non demand content that do not charge a subscription fee to users, as well as FAST; and transaction video on demand\n(“TVOD”), which includes apps that offer a la carte content purchases or rentals. Our billing service assists\ncontent partners with their billing needs, such as managing payment methods, subscriptions, and customer invoices.\nThis service also allows content partners to enable a frictionless signup within their app, and we believe this key\nbenefit simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for our content partners.\nContent partners also have access to our media and entertainment tools to help them attract, engage, and retain\nviewers by investing in promoting their content on our streaming platform. Content partners can use a variety of ad\ntypes, such as native display ads on the Roku Home Screen to drive app downloads, promote an app’s content, or\ndirect traffic to their apps in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also derive\nrevenue from the sale of branded app buttons on Roku remote controls that are intended to increase incremental\nusage of an app by enabling viewers to launch straight into the app from any screen. Our analytics and reporting\nassist content partners with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles, and we also can help\ncontent partners target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe to their services.\nJust as ads evolved decades ago when TV replaced radio as the primary entertainment medium, ads on TV streaming\noffer new and more performant opportunities than traditional TV. Advertisers are able to leverage the combination\nof our significant scale, our direct relationship with viewers, and our innovative ad products and technology to\nreach consumers with relevant messages. We offer advertisers a unique and effective set of tools to reach viewers\nand measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their return on investment.\nWe sell both in-stream video ads and display ads integrated into our user interface (“UI”). Our standard in-stream\nvideo ads are the same as the video advertising seen on traditional TV, but they are made more performant with data\nand technology. Additionally, we are able to offer a broader array of ad experiences than standard video ads, such\nas the ability to takeover an entire ad break, ads related to a specific Roku Original, and ads that appear when\nthe viewer pauses content.\nThe display ads we offer are integrated into the Roku Experience and are only possible because we are the streaming\nplatform. These differentiated ads fall into three main categories of native ads, native destinations, and action\nads. Native ads are high-visibility placements within our iconic Roku City screensaver, wallpaper-branded themes on\nthe Roku Home Screen or The Roku Channel, spotlight ads (placed directly below the Roku Home Screen Menu), or\nmarquee ads (placed directly to the right of the app tiles on the Roku Home Screen Menu) which can be either static\nor video. Native destinations include sponsorships of a playlist, zone (e.g., the Roku Sports Zone), fan experience\n(e.g., the premiere of a new TV show season), or a “pass” that provides viewers with a free movie/TV show. Action\nads can be combined with other ad types and create an easy way for viewers to use their remote to subscribe to a\nservice, purchase an item, or receive more information (e.g., OK-to-Text, OK-to-Checkout). Many of our action ads\nare in partnership with companies such as Walmart, Shopify, and Instacart that connect their products with viewers\nand provide enhanced targeting and closed-loop measurement.\n3\nTable of Contents\nRoku enables advertisers to measure TV streaming ad performance throughout the Roku Experience. Our measurement\nframework is built on a foundation of verified identity, consisting of direct relationships with viewers. We can\ncombine this asset with the advertiser’s preferred data sources to provide an expansive measurement toolkit that\nincludes reach measurement, brand resonance, and sales attribution, among others. We also have partnerships with\ncompanies such as iSpot.TV that allow advertisers to buy, optimize, and measure their campaigns, whether directly\nthrough Roku or through another buying platform.\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to further differentiate our streaming platform and increase the value we deliver\nto our viewers, content partners, and advertisers. We must regularly update and enhance our streaming platform to\nmeet evolving viewer behavior and provide a best-in-class content delivery and advertising platform. We must\nprovide content partners with best-in-class publishing tools and actionable audience insights. We must continue to\ninnovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental\nadvertising spend on our streaming platform. We aim to balance our commitment to growing Adjusted EBITDA and Free\nCash Flow with our investments to further expand our scale, engagement, and monetization.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe continue to innovate our advertising offerings. On the Roku Home Screen, we recently enhanced our marquee ads\nfrom static display to video. This new video capability has attracted diverse brands and verticals such as tech,\nfinancial services, quick-service restaurants, retail, consumer packaged goods, and auto. This is part of our\nongoing effort to diversify display ads on the Roku Home Screen beyond media and entertainment advertisers. We are\nworking to offer video in the marquee ads to more brands, while continuing to deliver a delightful user experience.\nAs part of our efforts to grow advertising demand, we are making it easier for advertisers to execute campaigns\nprogrammatically by expanding and deepening our relationships with third-party platforms, including demand-side\nplatforms (“DSPs”), supply-side platforms (“SSPs”), retail media networks, measurement, and other strategic\npartners. The Trade Desk (“TTD”) represents our deepest integration to date with a DSP. Additionally, Roku has\nadopted Unified ID 2.0 (“UID2”), an identity solution developed by TTD, that allows advertisers to deliver more\npersonalized ad experiences across Roku’s inventory and devices at scale. We expect we will continue to integrate\nwith third-party DSPs to expand our ability to serve multiple price points, and in doing so, we expect to drive\nincremental revenue over time.\nWe have also expanded our ad offering to better serve small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”). Roku Ads Manager,\nlaunched in September 2024, is our self-service connected TV advertising solution, providing performance features\nlike advanced targeting, conversion optimization and measurement, and shoppable ad formats. This solution builds on\nour growing list of ad offerings that provide advertisers with more choices with regard to how they buy Roku Media\n– whether through direct IO (insertion order), a preferred DSP partner, or self-service. This allows us to serve a\ndiverse array of advertisers across verticals and business sizes, from SMBs to enterprise companies.\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers viewers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to viewers, content\npartners, and advertisers is as compelling in international markets as it is in the United States. Today Roku\nstreaming devices are available in 15+ countries. We are the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico by hours streamed.\nInternationally, we continue to grow our footprint and deepen our presence in key markets. In Latin America, we\nannounced Roku TV models with Multi in Brazil; Kalley in Colombia; RCA in Chile; and Sharp, Caixun, and Hyundai in\nPeru. In the United Kingdom, we announced new Roku TV models with CHiQ, JVC, Veltek, and Logik and launched Roku TV\nmodels with Westinghouse. In international markets, we plan to continue to focus on building scale first,\nincreasing engagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nWe are successfully growing The Roku Channel audience internationally. The Roku Channel is available on devices\npowered by the Roku TV OS in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico remains the channel’s largest market\noutside of the United States by Streaming Households and Streaming Hours. With strong scale and engagement, we are\nworking to grow monetization in Mexico.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously grow scale, engagement, and\nmonetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily\nfocused on building and expanding relationships with content partners, advertisers, TV brands, and retailers, and\ndriving sales of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products to consumers through retail distribution\nchannels.\n4\nTable of Contents\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships to promote and build awareness\nof the features and advantages of our streaming platform among content partners, advertisers, and TV brands. Our\ndata science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our streaming platform to increase\neffectiveness for our content partners and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns. Our\nrelationship with content partners is typically client-direct. Through our dedicated content partner relationship\nmanagement team, we enter into agreements with content partners to distribute their apps on our streaming platform,\nor license their content for The Roku Channel, or both. As part of our distribution agreements with AVOD apps, we\ntypically secure direct access to a portion of the content partners’ video advertising inventory for our\nmonetization, and our sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content partners. Whereas\nour content partners typically feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large\nstreaming audience across many apps and via other Roku-branded experiences such as the Roku Home Screen at once\nusing our own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their goals across\nnumerous key performance indicators.\nWe are developing relationships with more third-party ad-buying platforms (e.g., retail media networks, DSPs, SSPs,\nand other strategic partners) to reach marketers buying programmatic advertising on such platforms and to create\nmore demand opportunities for our advertising inventory. Our ad sales teams and products are organized into groups\nthat specialize in the unique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii)\nindependent agency and mid-market clients, (iii) content partners and entertainment brands, (iv) performance and\ndirect-to-consumer brands, and (v) international markets.\nWe work with our licensed Roku TV partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\nplanning, manufacturing, and marketing. In the United States, the majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website\n(excluding Roku TV models). We also sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon,\nBest Buy, Walmart, and Target collectively accounted for 81% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31,\n2024 and 76% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. We support retailers with an experienced\nsales management team and work closely with these retailers to assist with marketing and product mix forecasting.\nWe intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and device sales. Our revenue and\ngross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a higher\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our streaming device sales through retailers in an effort to grow our\nStreaming Households, which typically reduce our devices gross margin or results in a devices gross loss in the\nfourth quarter.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and outsourced development and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new TVs, players, audio\nproducts, smart home devices, features, and functionality. We work closely with content partners, advertisers, and\nlicensed Roku TV partners to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development\nprocess that seeks to take input from our partners into account when making decisions about our future product and\nservice offerings. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features and enhancements to our\nplatform. We intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development to bring new or improved\nproducts and services to market.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and\nother contractors and vendors. All of our products are manufactured in China, Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Mexico.\nOur contracts do not obligate our partners to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific\nprice. Our manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecasts we establish based upon\nhistorical trends and analysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The manufacturers ship\nour products to our third-party warehouses, from where we ship our products directly to retailers, wholesale\ndistributors, and consumers.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our products and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\n5\nTable of Contents\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprotections, often bringing enforcement actions for unfair acts or deceptive practices related to privacy and\nsecurity or other consumer protection matters. An increasing number of states have passed, or are considering,\nlegislation to govern consumer privacy or consumer protection online. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we\noperate impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections, compared to the United\nStates. Consumer privacy and consumer protection laws, and regulators’ interpretations of these laws, may become\nmore diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the challenges and costs associated with complying with these\nlaws in all jurisdictions. Governments in both the U.S. and other jurisdictions also have adopted, or are\nconsidering adoption, of laws and regulations intended to protect minors’ privacy and otherwise protect minors from\nperceived harms online. Privacy and other laws also may limit the ability of advertisers to fully utilize our\nplatform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet.\nOur business also is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. For example, the threat, implementation, or\nmodification of new import restrictions in the U.S., as well as any retaliatory measures adopted by affected U.S.\ntrade partners, could prove disruptive to the business environment in which we operate.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\ncertain local content quotas or production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1,500 issued patents and 600 pending applications in the United\nStates and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our\nproduct offerings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business,\nsee Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on building scale by growing our user base, growing engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed\nthrough our platform, and growing the monetization of the activities that viewers engage in through our platform.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming devices and companies that license\ntheir operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs as well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\n6\nTable of Contents\nstreaming applications that enable users to stream content on phones, tablets, and laptop computers;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach viewers on other content and advertising mediums,\nincluding on other ad-supported streaming services and social media applications;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games;\ncompanies that offer products that compete with our audio products or our smart home products and services; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices or offer remote work positions that may be better\nable to attract and retain top talent in engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations,\nand other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects. We also compete with these same publishers in seeking to sell advertising to support the\ndistribution of streaming content. A number of leading content publishers have launched ad-supported subscription\ntiers and FAST channels, which offer consumers access to content either for free or for a lower subscription fee.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2024, we employed approximately 3,340 full-time employees located in 15 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees have adopted a\nhybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level. We\nalso emphasize integrity, transparency, and honesty in our internal and external conduct of business. All employees\nare required to comply fully with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, which sets forth our values, business\nculture, and practices.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to leverage\nour broad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions. As we grow our business, our goal is to\nensure that Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive.\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace to spark innovation, strengthen teamwork, equip us to build\nexceptional products, and drive us to deliver the best TV streaming content. We believe our employees should feel\nrespected, valued, and empowered to contribute, collaborate, and thrive. Our Inclusion Strategy team partners\nacross Roku to implement coordinated programs that advance inclusion, supports our employee resource groups, and\ncollaborates with our Talent Acquisition team to expand our talent community and share our employer brand story. In\naddition, as a global TV streaming platform, we seek to delight our consumers through inclusive content, services,\nand partnerships that enrich the Roku Experience for our audiences everywhere. Our Inclusion Strategy and Roku\nMedia teams partner to elevate storytelling that authentically represents and resonates with audiences from\ndifferent backgrounds.\nWe seek to make purposeful investments in developing future talent across our industry through our Social Impact\nprogram. Our employees partner with nonprofits to share their expertise and provide young people with valuable\nindustry insights and hands-on experiences. We also collaborate with external organizations to connect a broad\nrange of talent with real-world opportunities in media and entertainment.\nOur Learning and Talent Development team provides our employees with the training and development needed to support\nour strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive new hire\nonboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources needed to increase our new hires’ speed to\nproductivity. In addition to required trainings, we offer employees a suite of highly encouraged offerings covering\ntopics such as high-performance feedback, career development, change management, and communication skills. Managers\nare provided with training on expectations for managers and have access to a 1:1 leadership coaching program to\nsupport new and newly promoted leaders in managing and leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access\nto on-demand technical and non-technical skill development through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to\nreview, refresh, purchase, and custom-build additional training materials to support our global employees’\nperformance and development needs.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation opportunity, we consider what that employee would be\npaid by another employer, what we would have to pay to replace that employee if the employee leaves Roku, and the\namount we would pay to retain that employee. Generally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of\nsalary and equity awards rather than offering specific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by\ndifferent employees. We generally do not pay cash bonuses (other than to employees eligible for sales commissions)\nor have performance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to our employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

differentiate our streaming platform and compete successfully with our competitors, it will be\ndifficult for us to attract and retain users and our business will be adversely impacted.\nThe TV streaming industry—including the sale of TV streaming devices as well as the sale of advertising on TV\nstreaming platforms—is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on user acquisition and retention\nand the effective monetization of our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we must respond efficiently\nto changes in user tastes and preferences and offer our users access to the content they demand on terms that they\naccept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features and functionality of our streaming\nplatform for users, content partners, and advertisers. We also must effectively support popular sources of\nstreaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, and\nYouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in the TV streaming industry.\nLarge companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming\ndevices and those of our licensed Roku TV partners and the Roku TV OS. Google licenses its Android operating system\nsoftware for integration into smart TVs, including those of certain of our existing TV partners, and service\nprovider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into smart TVs and sells\nAmazon-branded smart TVs. We may also face increased competition from Walmart (which makes and sells Onn. branded\nstreaming products, including co-branded Roku TV models), in light of Walmart’s recent acquisition of Vizio (which\nmakes and sells smart TVs with a proprietary operating system). These companies have greater financial resources\nthan we do and can subsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements to promote their other\nproducts and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, increase\nStreaming Hours, and monetize our streaming platform. These competitors could also implement standards or\ntechnology that are not compatible with our products or that provide a better streaming experience and have greater\nresources to more aggressively promote their brands through advertising than we do.\nIn addition, we compete for Streaming Hours with many TV brands, including certain of our existing TV partners,\nthat offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs, mobile streaming applications on smartphones and\ntablets, and other devices and platforms, such as game consoles with TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some\nservice operators, such as Comcast and Charter Communications (and their joint venture, Xumo, LLC), offer TV\nstreaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing user bases,\ninstallation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in TV streaming. If\nviewers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to Roku streaming devices, we may not be able to\nachieve our expected growth in platform revenue, gross profit, and our key performance metrics.\nWe expect continued competition in TV streaming, which could result in pricing pressure, lower revenue and gross\nprofit, declines in our key performance metrics, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our streaming platform,\nor our other products to gain or maintain broad market acceptance.\nTo remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading TV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest\nin our platform, product development, marketing, service and support, and device distribution infrastructure. In\naddition, evolving TV standards and unknown future developments may require further investments in the development\nof Roku streaming devices, our streaming platform, and our other products. We may not have sufficient resources to\ncontinue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive position. In addition, many of our competitors\nhave longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater\nfinancial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which provide them with advantages in\ndeveloping, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they may be able to respond more\nquickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sales, and distribution of their\nproducts or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products better than we can. These competitors\nmay also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards and may be able to deliver\nproducts and services at a lower cost. Sustained competition could reduce our sales volume, revenue, and operating\nmargins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our business.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer Roku-branded smart home products and services, and audio products,\nincluding wireless speakers and subwoofers. As a result, we face additional competition from other brands of smart\nhome and audio products. If our smart home and audio products do not operate as designed or do not enhance the Roku\nExperience as we intend, our users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, which may impact the overall\ndemand for our products and our partners’ Roku TV models.\nOur competitors offer content and other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our\nstreaming platform.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, social media platforms, and other digital platforms, as well as traditional\nmedia, such as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer\ncontent and other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These\ncompetitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may\nadversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from\nadvertising. Many major\n11\nTable of Contents\nSVOD services, including Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video, now have ad-supported SVOD tiers, which has\nfurther increased competition for streaming TV advertising revenue. These services, as well as other services such\nas YouTube and services that have FAST channels (such as Tubi and Pluto), sell (either through direct sales or\nprogrammatically through third parties) advertising inventory in their ad-supported content that is distributed on\nour streaming platform. Our business and growth prospects may be harmed if we are unable to increase our revenue\nfrom advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our streaming platform’s capabilities to further\noptimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns; continuing to increase our streaming platform’s reach; increasing,\ndifferentiating, and selling our advertising inventory, including video advertising inventory we sell in The Roku\nChannel, video advertising inventory that we acquire through our streaming services distribution agreements, and\ndisplay ads included throughout the Roku Experience; innovating our ad product offerings; and maintaining a strong\nadvertising sales team and programmatic capabilities. See also “— If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply\nof quality video advertising inventory on our streaming platform or generate sufficient demand to effectively sell\nour available video advertising inventory, our business may be harmed .”\nIf advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to advertising in traditional\nmedia or on other digital platforms rather than on advertising on our streaming platform, the future growth of our\nbusiness may be negatively impacted.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to advertising in\ntraditional media or on other digital platforms, such as traditional TV, radio, print publications, and social\nmedia. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of advertising on TV streaming platforms and on\nadvertisers increasing their spending on advertising on our TV streaming platform. Although traditional TV\nadvertisers have shown growing interest in advertising on TV streaming platforms, we cannot be certain that their\ninterest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to traditional TV advertising or shift their\nadvertising spending to social media and other digital platforms. In addition, if we are unable to compete with\nsocial media and other digital platforms to win business from advertisers and advertising agencies who have\ntraditionally advertised on these platforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small or medium-sized businesses, our\nability to grow our business may be limited. If advertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive\nmeaningful benefits of advertising on our TV streaming platform, the market may develop more slowly than we expect,\nwhich could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nFinally, there is political or regulatory pressure in some countries to limit streaming TV advertising (including\nlimiting the advertising that may be associated with children’s content) or impose local content requirements on\nstreaming TV services, which could pose a threat to our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video advertising inventory on our streaming platform or\ngenerate sufficient demand to effectively sell our available video advertising inventory, our business may be\nharmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video advertising inventory on our streaming platform and sell it\nto advertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video advertising inventory\nfor us to sell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable\nto secure content that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a\nsufficient supply of advertising inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video advertising inventory will be\nnegatively impacted. We are also dependent on our ability to monetize video advertising inventory within other ad-\nsupported apps on our streaming platform and seek to sell such inventory from the content partners of such apps. We\nmay fail to attract content partners that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours\non our streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient supply of such advertising inventory from the\npublishers.\nOur access to video advertising inventory in ad-supported streaming apps on our streaming platform varies greatly\namong apps and the amount, quality, and cost of video advertising inventory available to us can change at any time.\nAccordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video advertising inventory on our streaming\nplatform. For certain apps, including YouTube’s ad-supported app, we have no access to video advertising inventory\nat this time, and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services introduce new ad-\nsupported tiers to their streaming services, we have in the past been unable, and in the future may be unable, to\nobtain access to video advertising inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. If we cannot\ngrow, maintain, and generate sufficient demand for an adequate supply of quality video advertising inventory at\nreasonable costs to keep up with demand or sell such advertising inventory at our desired price, our business may\nbe harmed. If we are unable to effectively sell our available video advertising inventory, our business may be\nharmed.\nIf the advertising campaigns that run on our streaming platform decrease or are not relevant or not engaging to our\nusers, our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to engage with more advertisers and content partners, and\nenable them to deliver more relevant advertising campaigns to our viewers. However, a small number of content\npartners historically have accounted for a significant portion of the spending on ads integrated into our UI, and\nconsolidation among content partners has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in decreased spending\non ads integrated into our UI. If our content partners decrease spending on ads integrated into our UI, our\nfinancial condition and operating results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, existing and prospective advertisers may not be successful in serving advertising campaigns that lead\nto and maintain viewer engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem irrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and\nintrusive. For example, viewers may dislike the content and frequency of advertising that appears on the Roku Home\nScreen. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of our advertisers with our desire to provide an\noptimal viewer experience, but we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain\nviewers, advertisers, and content partners. If the advertising campaigns run on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant, are overly intrusive or too frequent, or are an impediment to the use of our platform, our viewers may\nstop using our platform, resulting in a reduction of our user base and Streaming Hours, which will harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with programmatic advertising.\nThe market for programmatic streaming TV ad buying is growing, and advertisers and advertising agencies can\nprogrammatically purchase and manage their streaming TV, desktop, and mobile advertising campaigns both off and on\nthe Roku platform through third-party demand sources (such as third-party DSPs and SSPs) and through our media\nbuying channels. If our current and potential advertising partners do not continue to shift to programmatic ad\nbuying from other buying methods, or if we are unable to expand our programmatic demand by maintaining and\ndeveloping third-party demand relationships in a way that is competitive with other advertising platforms, our\nbusiness could be harmed. In addition, if DSPs or SSPs do not have the functionality or services expected by\nadvertisers or advertising agencies, they may take their advertising spend to a non-Roku platform. We also may not\nbe able to adapt to changes or trends in programmatic streaming TV advertising, which would harm our ability to\ngrow our advertising revenue and harm our business.\nFurthermore, the programmatic advertising ecosystem is large, distributed, and complex, requiring us to integrate\nwith several key third-party advertising partners. Our compliance with applicable laws and regulations therefore\nmay depend in part on these partners’ commitment to handling user data with the care that we require or expect of\nthem. Because integration of our respective systems is complex and rapidly evolving, we and our partners may be\nsusceptible to breaches, failures, and other errors (whether inadvertent or intentional). We expect to encounter\nmore of these challenges and issues as the number of partners we integrate with increases.\nWe are subject to credit and payment-related risks if our advertisers, advertising agencies, or programmatic\npartners do not pay or dispute their invoices, which could harm our business.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.\nThis credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In\naddition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated\nperiod of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. Further,\nwe typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While\nwe attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not\nalways successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than\nour accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies, their advertisers, or our programmatic partners over the\noperation of our streaming platform, the terms of our agreements, or our billings for purchases made by them\nthrough our streaming platform, our DSP, or other programmatic partners. If we are unable to collect or make\nadjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In the future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such\ncontingencies, and our bad debt exposure may increase over time. Any increase in write-offs for bad debt could have\na materially negative effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Though we have not\nexperienced significant credit losses to date, if we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on\ntime or at all, our business may be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our expanding user base and streaming activity as we\nincrease the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content partners\nthrough ad-supported content. We generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising\n(including direct and programmatic video advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services) and\nstreaming services distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium\nSubscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls). As such, we are seeking to expand our user\nbase and increase Streaming Hours in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user\nbase grows and as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively\nmonetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of Streaming Hours does not correlate\nwith platform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed or\nevery user on our platform. Moreover, Streaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device\nis streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if our streaming player is\nconnected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps\n13\nTable of Contents\naway, or falls asleep without stopping or pausing the player, then a particular streaming app may continue to play\ncontent for a period of time determined by the streaming app. Roku TV OS’s “Are you still watching?” feature, which\nprompts users to confirm they are still watching, does not resolve this lack of correlation.\nOur ability to deliver advertisements relevant to our users and to increase our streaming platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content partners depends on the collection of user engagement data, and the degree to which our\nusers consent to, opt out of, or limit the collection or use of data for advertisements, including as a result of\nproduct changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future related to new applicable\nlaws, regulations, industry standards, regulatory actions, or litigation that impact our ability to use data for\nadvertising purposes. Content partners may also refuse to allow us to collect data regarding user engagement or\nrefuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our legal obligations or technical\nrequirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing data from many of our most\npopular apps to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users.\nOther apps available on our streaming platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are\nfocused on increasing user engagement and time spent within their apps by allowing users to purchase additional\ncontent and streaming services within their apps. When users purchase these products and services, we may earn less\nrevenue than when such products and services are purchased directly from us. Additionally, if our users spend most\nof their time within particular apps where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user\ninformation, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant\nadvertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue, gross profit, or certain key\nperformance metrics. Additionally, our distribution agreements with our most popular apps are renegotiated\nperiodically; thus, even if we are currently able to monetize Streaming Hours within an app, we may not be able to\ndo so in the future. If we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nOur efforts to monetize our streaming platform may not continue to grow as we expect, and at times our platform\nrevenue growth has been, and may in the future be, lower than expected due to advertising inventory supply and\ndemand imbalances; advertisers significantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to macroeconomic\nfactors or other factors beyond our control; competitive pressures from video advertising offerings on other TV\nstreaming platforms or services; or the non-binding nature of advertisers’ spending commitments. For example,\nspending commitments we obtain in connection with annual TV Upfront presentations are typically not fully binding,\nand the revenue we receive from such commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. To materially\nincrease the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we must generate\nsignificantly more advertising revenue on our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-supported content that\nresults in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. We cannot assure you that we will be\nsuccessful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our operation and monetization of The Roku Channel.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television\nseries, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses\nin connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily\nthrough advertising. We also commission original content that we own and distribute on The Roku Channel. From time\nto time, we may remove underperforming content from The Roku Channel and record an impairment charge related to\nsuch removal.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. Our\nagreements with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make specific content\navailable through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these agreements, we must re-\nnegotiate and renew these agreements with the existing content owners, or enter into new agreements with other\ncontent owners, to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the duration of the rights previously\ngranted. If we cannot enter into content license agreements on acceptable terms to access content that enables us\nto attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel, or if the content we do secure rights\nto stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers, usage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our\nbusiness may be harmed. Further, even if we successfully monetize The Roku Channel in the United States, we may not\nbe successful in monetizing The Roku Channel in international markets. See also “ —We may be unable to successfully\nexpand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if implemented, will subject us to a\nvariety of risks that may harm our business. ”\nIn addition, we produce content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited\nexperience producing content, and we may not succeed in doing so in a cost-effective manner that furthers the\ngrowth of The Roku Channel and increases its appeal to our users and advertisers. We also assume risks associated\nwith content production, such as completion and key talent risks, and the risk of litigation and claims related to\nour content production.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not relevant to our users or are overly intrusive and\nimpede our users’ enjoyment of the available content, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on\nThe Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not generate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective\nfor us to operate. In addition, we distribute The Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform,\nand we may not be successful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from\nadvertising through the distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nThe sale of Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel also generates platform revenue and carries certain non-\nadvertising related risks. See “ —If our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our streaming platform\nor through other apps on our streaming platform, our business may be harmed. ”\nWe depend on a small number of content partners for a majority of our Streaming Hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content partners have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed on\nour platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the top three streaming services (excluding The Roku\nChannel) represented almost 50% of all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing apps\nthat have historically streamed a large percentage of the aggregate Streaming Hours on our platform, our Streaming\nHours, user base, or Roku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our streaming platform, we may fail to retain\nexisting users and attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming apps, streaming app features, and content on our platform. In order to\nremain competitive, we must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming apps, streaming app features,\nstreaming app bundles, and content, particularly as we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by\nthe Roku TV OS, or enter new markets, including international markets. This may be challenging as the industry\ncontinues to evolve, including through consolidation of content publishers, joint ventures among content\npublishers, and licensing of content between content publishers. If we are not successful in helping our content\npublishers launch, maintain, and expand their streaming apps and streaming app features that attract and retain a\nsignificant number of users on our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner,\nour business will be harmed. Our success in assisting our content publishers maintain and expand their app\nofferings on a cost-effective basis largely depends on our ability to effectively promote and market streaming\napps, minimize launch delays or downtime of streaming apps, and minimize streaming platform downtime and other\ntechnical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream\ncertain apps or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of\npopular streaming apps or content may be limited, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content partners may result in the removal of certain\napps or app features from our streaming platform and harm our streaming device sales, user base growth, and\nengagement.\nOur agreements with content partners generally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the\nend of the term by the content partner under certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the\nagreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content partners’ security or\nother platform certification requirements. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and\nrenew them in order to continue providing content from these content partners on our streaming platform. We have in\nthe past been unable, and in the future may not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content\npartners before our existing agreements have expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis\non mutually agreeable terms, or if a content partner terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we\nmay be required to temporarily or permanently remove certain apps or app features from our streaming platform.\nThe loss of such apps or app features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our business.\nMore broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content partners on terms favorable to us, or at\nall, or if these content partners face problems in delivering their content across our streaming platform, we may\nlose app partners or users and our streaming device sales, user base growth, and engagement may be harmed.\nIf our content partners do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time or choose\ndevelop their apps on alternative streaming platforms, our business may be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content partners or meet their business or technical requirements. For example, some content\npartners have elected not to participate in new Roku Home Screen Menu features or in our Roku Zones (collections of\nrelated content from apps across our streaming platform) or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage\nwithin their apps. See also “ —We may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our expanding user base\nand streaming activity as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, which may\nharm our business. ” In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language\nto allow our content partners to develop and create apps on our streaming platform. Certain content partners may\nfind other languages, such\n15\nTable of Contents\nas HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their apps on other platforms. If\nkey content partners do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop apps for, do not value and\nparticipate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine that our\nsoftware developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their requirements, our business may be harmed.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our streaming platform or through other apps on our\nstreaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content partners activated on or through our streaming\nplatform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from\nvarious content partners. If users reduce their use of our streaming platform for these purchases or subscriptions\nfor any reason, including opting to pay for services directly with content partners or by other means for which we\ndo not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain apps available on our streaming platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services\nfrom within those apps. The revenue we earn from these transactions, if any, is not always equivalent to the\nrevenue we earn from sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our streaming platform. If\nusers increase their spending on such in-app transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our\nstreaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV\npartners and manufacturing partners.\nWe license the Roku TV OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand and manufacturing partners for the\ndevelopment, manufacture, and commercialization of licensed Roku TV models and, for a number of years, the sale of\nRoku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has materially contributed to growth in our user base and Streaming\nHours and supported our platform monetization efforts. As our Roku TV licensing program has expanded to certain\nmarkets outside the United States, international users are representing an increasing share of our user base. We\nhave developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with these TV brand and manufacturing\npartners as we continue to invest in the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and\ninternational markets. We typically do not receive or expect license revenue from these license arrangements but\nincur operating expenses to establish and support them. The economic benefits that we derive from these license\narrangements are and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily growth of our user base and increasing\nStreaming Hours, and both enabling us to generate more streaming services distribution and advertising-related\nrevenue on our platform. If these arrangements do not continue to result in increased user base and Streaming\nHours, and if that growth does not in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our\nbusiness may be harmed. See also “ —We may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our expanding user\nbase and streaming activity as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, which\nmay harm our business. ”\nThe loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner (including as a result of our launch of Roku-branded TVs\nthat are designed, made, and sold by us) could harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase\npricing and promotional pressures from other partners and retail distribution channels, increase our marketing\ncosts, and result in the loss of revenue. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new\nrelationships with any of these licensed Roku TV partners, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, or\nother impediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or maintain our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur Roku TV licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Under these license\narrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources our licensing\npartners may dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their\nforecasts and anticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to do so in the\nfuture. If our licensed Roku TV partners fail to meet their forecasts or launch dates for distributing our\nstreaming devices or choose to deploy competing streaming solutions within their product lines, our business may be\nharmed.\nWe and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective\nproducts, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners\ncould experience lower product sales.\nTo continue to grow our user base, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and for the\nRoku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’\nproducts are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Costco, Target, and Walmart,\ntheir respective online sales platforms, and traditional online retailers such as Amazon.\nWe also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers\nsuch as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, MediaMarkt in Germany, and Currys in the United Kingdom. As we\nare still a recent entrant in international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or\nrelationships with retailers for those markets as compared to our retail sales channels in the United States or our\ncompetitors in international markets. See also “ —We may be unable to successfully expand our international\noperations, and our international expansion plans, if implemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may\nharm our business .”\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur retailers and distributors also sell products that compete with our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’\nproducts, including house-branded televisions sold by such retailers that utilize TV operating systems other than\nthe Roku TV OS. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or\ndistributors, and there can be no assurance that we will reach agreements with our retailers and distributors on\nterms we find acceptable or that will be consistent with our past practices.\nWe may be reliant on certain retailers or distributors. Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart in total accounted\nfor 81% and 76% of our devices revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Furthermore,\nour licensed Roku TV partners may be reliant on the same or other retailers and distributors for a significant\nportion of their unit sales of Roku TV models. If one or several retailers or distributors were to discontinue\nselling our or licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to prominently display those products in their\nstores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations, the volume of\nour or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could decrease, which would harm our business. These risks may\nbe exacerbated by our reliance on certain retailers or distributors, or when a major retailer in a jurisdiction\ncommercializes televisions under brands that the retailer controls.\nIn addition, if any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work exclusively with, or divert a\nsignificant portion of their business with us, to other operating system developers, this may adversely impact our\nability to continue to license the Roku TV OS and our smart TV reference design to TV brands and to grow our user\nbase and monetize the Roku TV OS. Traditional retailers have limited shelf and end cap space in their stores and\nlimited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website product placement space. Competition\nis intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines, stronger brand identity, and\ngreater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In\naddition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart\nhome devices, is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to\noffer or promote our products on its website. We also may face increased competition with Walmart (which currently\nmakes and sells Onn. branded streaming products, including co-branded Roku TV models), in light of Walmart’s recent\nacquisition of Vizio (which also makes and sells smart TVs with a proprietary operating system). See also “ —If our\nefforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may not be\nable to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed ” and “ —If we fail to differentiate our streaming\nplatform and compete successfully with our competitors, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users and\nour business will be adversely impacted. ” Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our products, or\nincreased competition for available shelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing or other\nexpenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in reduced visibility for our products, which may\nharm our business. In particular, the availability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the\nholiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our products during\nthese periods, our business would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor, and our\nbrand may be negatively impacted by factors, some which are beyond our control, such as the quality and reliability\nof the Roku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content provided by our content\npartners. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and consumer demand for their\nproducts more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and may have\ngreater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through traditional advertising, digital advertising,\nor website product placement. See also “ —If we fail to differentiate our streaming platform and compete\nsuccessfully with our competitors, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users and our business will be\nadversely impacted.” If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand, it may be difficult to differentiate\nour business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace, which may adversely affect our ability\nto attract and retain users and harm our business.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of apps, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content partners. While we have policies that prohibit the publication of content that is\nunlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates third-party rights, among other things, we may distribute apps\nthat include controversial content. Controversies related to the content included on certain apps that we\ndistribute have resulted in, and could in the future result in, negative publicity, cause harm to our reputation\nand brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\nIf we encounter problems with the limited number of contract manufacturers we primarily depend upon, our operations\ncould be disrupted.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among\nother issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\n17\nTable of Contents\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions, delays, or increased costs, including from labor disputes,\nstrikes, mechanical issues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health\ncrises; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new products.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component\nshortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems in the past have impaired, and could in the\nfuture impair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in\nour contract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our\nretailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our\nproducts. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete\ndesired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract\nmanufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because\nof inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they\ndecide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or terminated, and we would\nhave to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract manufacturers.\nAlternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy\nour production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely\nbasis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could\nrequire us to reduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our\nrevenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,\nare located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,\nsocial, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or\ndisrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the tensions between\nTaiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese suppliers,\nour supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international location of these\nfacilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade restrictions on\nexports or imports.\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems\nwith their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.\nSome of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or\nexclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to\nretailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in\ntariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports; restrictions, by the\nUnited States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or\ncomponents for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions, increased shipping costs, and shipping delays.\nOur licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or\nsuppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku\nTV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV\nmodels at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models\nsold at retail, resulting in slower user base and Streaming Hours growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models\ncould harm our brand and our business.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our\ncontract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nproducts are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many\nmonths in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess\ncomponents and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or\nbuild excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have\nagreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our\ndecision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess\nsupply commitments, our business may be harmed.\nConversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material\nor component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities\navailable to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In\naddition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship\nour products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross\nmargin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately\nforecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nobtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to\nour retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players\nand TVs powered by the Roku TV OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi\nfront-end module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a\nsecond source.\nAlthough this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering\ndevelopment and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also\ncreates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or\nmaterial supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other\nexport or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their\ncomponents (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.\nThere is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired\nby or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on\nallocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control\nrestrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,\nor logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary\npressures, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and\nmay in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,\nand which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source\nsupplier may require that we adapt our software and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,\nand may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to: supplier\ncapacity constraints; price increases, including those related to inflationary pressures, tariffs, and material\ncosts; timely delivery; component quality; and delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for\ncomponents and technologies. Any interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could\nadversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost\nsales and higher expenses, and harm our business.\nIf our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content partners\nand other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku TV OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via\nRoku streaming devices offered at a low cost to users. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all apps\nand other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners, including virtual multi-channel video\nprogramming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings, technologies, and\nsystems beyond our app certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not provide our users with a\nhigh-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are made to those offerings that\nare not compatible\n19\nTable of Contents\nwith Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase user base growth and user engagement or may be required\nto increase our hardware costs, and our business will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, the Roku-branded TVs we launched\nin 2023 and 2024, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such products to function well with these\nofferings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content partners have the right to test and\ncertify our new products before we can publish their apps. The certification processes can be time-consuming and\nintroduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If our content partners do not certify new\nproducts on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain certifications, our product release\nplans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products to all licensed Roku TV partners or\nwe may not continue to offer certain apps. To continue to grow our user base and user engagement, we will need to\nprioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies, and systems. If\nwe are unable to maintain consistent operability of Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than\nother platforms, our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners may impact the\naccessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of Roku streaming devices. We may not\nsuccessfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these offerings, technologies, or\nsystems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings, technologies, or systems,\nour business could be harmed.\nOur products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in\nways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have in the past contained, and may\nin the future contain, hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any\nnumber of ways in our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security\nvulnerabilities, data loss or poor quality, device malfunctions, account inactivity, or even permanently disabled\nproducts. Some errors may only be discovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some\ncases only be detected under certain circumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular\nbasis, and, despite our quality assurance processes, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such\nupdate.\nThe introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a\nlimited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product\nsupport, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of\ntime. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in\nrevenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information\nliability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with\nour end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be\nupheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely\naffect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate\nor future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown\nto us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they\ncould cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by\nwhich our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network\nrouter. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access\npoint, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to\nrecall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable expense. In addition, if our insurance\ncoverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be\nharmed. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely\naffected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable licenses, certifications, or approvals related to our\nuse or support of third-party technology, intellectual property, or services then our ability to develop and\nintroduce new products and services, and continue to manufacture, update, and commercialize existing products and\nservices, may be impaired.\nWe use or enable in our products and services certain industry standard and other technology, intellectual\nproperty, and services that are obtained from third parties. In order to continue to make, distribute, update, and\ncommercialize existing products and services and introduce and commercialize new products and services that use a\nthird-party technology, we may be required to maintain certain licenses, certifications, and approvals from the\nrelevant third parties. The licenses, certifications, and approvals we need to obtain may be or become unavailable\nto us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party\nlicenses, certifications, or approvals, we may have to obtain substitute technologies, intellectual property, or\nservices with lower\n20\nTable of Contents\nquality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, or remove desired functions and features from our products\nand services, any of which could harm customer and partner relationships, as well as the competitiveness of our\nproducts, services, and business.\nOur products and services are designed to be compatible with numerous industry standards. In many cases, these\nindustry standards have numerous associated patents known generally as standard essential patents (“SEPs”). Over\ntime, SEP owners have increasingly turned away from licensing their SEPs through patent pools, preferring to\nlicense their portfolios directly. This has increased the number of licensors (since the patents are not pooled)\nand increased the time, cost, and difficulty of SEP licensing. If we are unable to obtain a license to a necessary\nSEP on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or find a suitable substitute technology that complies with the\nindustry standard, our customer and partner relationships, as well as the competitiveness of our products and\nservices, and our business may be harmed. See also “ —We must continue to innovate and develop new and existing\nproducts and services to remain competitive, and new products and services expose our business to new risks. ”\nWe must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new\nproducts and services expose our business to new risks.\nWe must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet\nchanging consumer demands. The introduction of a new product or service is a complex process, involving significant\nexpenditures in research and development, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to\nnew risks. The introduction of new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may\nresult in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications\nthat could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. In addition, our entrance into entirely\nnew lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV streaming and advertising, such as our Roku-branded\nsmart home products, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ from the risks we face as a\nresult of our historical TV streaming business.\nWhether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our\nability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to\nour streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. See also “ —If\npopular or new content publishers do not publish content on our streaming platform, we may fail to retain existing\nusers and attract new users. ”\nThe successful development and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with appropriate manufacturers;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our products, produce quality products,\nand minimize defects, manufacturing mishaps, shipping costs, and delays;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments;\nour ability to comply with regulatory requirements; and\nour ability to attract and retain high quality research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or services\nin a timely or cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed. We do not expect that all of our new products\nand services will be successful.\nWe are incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and services, which may present operational and\nreputational risks.\nWe have incorporated and intend to continue to incorporate AI technologies, such as generative AI, into our\nproducts and services. For example, we have introduced a generative-driven ad creation service for our advertisers\nto help them create ads more easily, and we continue to use AI technologies to power our content recommendation\nengine and our content row on the Roku Home Screen. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that\ncould adversely impact our business. AI technologies can create accuracy issues, unintended biases, and\ndiscriminatory outcomes, or may create content that appears correct but is inaccurate or flawed. If the\nrecommendations, content, or analyses that AI applications produce are or are alleged to be deficient or\ninaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nThe legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the\nareas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. For example, there is uncertainty\naround the validity and enforceability of\n21\nTable of Contents\nintellectual property rights related to the use, development, and deployment of AI technologies. Compliance with\nnew or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and\nmay limit our ability to develop, deploy, or use AI technologies. See also “ —If government regulations or laws\nrelating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the\nmanner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed. ” There can be no assurance that the\nmeasures we have taken to mitigate the potential risks related to generative AI will be sufficient. Failure to\nappropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and\nreputational harm.\nIf we fail to provide adequate levels of quality customer support, we could lose users, advertisers, content\npartners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.\nA high level of support is critical for the success of our business, and our users depend on this support to\nresolve issues relating to our products and our streaming platform. We currently outsource the majority of our\ncustomer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end users and\nlicensees. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage our third-party customer support organization to\nassist our users and licensees, and if that support organization does not succeed in helping them quickly resolve\nissues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to monetize our streaming\nplatform, to sell our products to users and could harm our reputation with potential new customers and our\nlicensees.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior\nquarters, we may continue to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability\nagain in the near term or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we\nachieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near\nterm or at all. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,427.0 million. Our operating expenses\nhave increased in the past and may increase again in the future as we expand our operations and invest in growth\nand new areas. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may\nnot be able to achieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of\nreasons, including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may\nencounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may\nresult in losses in future periods.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, key performance metrics, and other operating results could vary significantly from\nquarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors,\nincluding many factors that are outside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our\noperating results and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services;\nour ability to retain and grow our user base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and monetize our\nstreaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to competitive market conditions or other\nmacroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes, inflation, or tariffs, and our ability to control costs, including\nour operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our platform and advertiser demand for such inventory;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, apps, or features;\nthe addition or removal of content or apps from our streaming platform;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;\ndelays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or\ndistribution chains; and\nan increase in legal costs, including costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending\nagainst intellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to intellectual property.\nSee also “—The market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value\nof our Class A common stock may decline.”\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment experienced negative gross\nmargin for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our platform segment experienced positive gross margin for the\nyear\n22\nTable of Contents\nended December 31, 2024. Gross margins on our streaming devices vary across models and can change over time as a\nresult of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, device returns, and other cost\nfluctuations.\nIn addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or retail sales channel mix, component cost increases, price\ncompetition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or\nreduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin or record\nnegative gross margin on devices in an effort to grow our user base and gross profit.\nAs a result, our devices segment revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has in the past, or at all, and, unless\nwe are able to continue to increase our platform segment revenue and grow our user base, we may be unable to grow\ngross profit and our business will be harmed. For example, from time to time, global supply chain disruptions have\nresulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices,\nwhich negatively affected our devices gross margin. If a reduction in devices gross margin does not result in an\nincrease in our user base or an increase in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may\nsuffer, and our business may be harmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past, and may\nexperience in the future, lower gross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower than we\nanticipate, our financial results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing,\nsupport services, operations, and general and administrative functions, and we may expand certain of these\nactivities in the future. Our historical growth has placed, and any future growth will continue to place,\nsignificant demands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nexpand our product offerings;\nsupport our licensed Roku TV partners;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our streaming platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to\nexecute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have previously undertaken restructuring plans to adjust our investment priorities and manage our operating\nexpenses, and we may do so again in the future. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, material costs and\ncharges in connection with restructuring plans and initiatives, and there can be no assurance that any\nrestructuring plans and initiatives will be successful. Any restructuring plans may adversely affect our internal\nprograms and our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity,\nloss of accumulated knowledge, or inefficiency during transitional periods, may require a significant amount of\nemployees’ time and focus, and may be distracting to employees, which may divert attention from operating and\ngrowing our business. For more information, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8\nof this Annual Report.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or are unable to manage our\ngrowth and expansion plans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business,\noperating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering, have\ngreater experience managing a global organization, and have greater resources.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering and evolving legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations\npertaining to data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade (including tariffs,\nquotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content restrictions, AI\ntechnologies, intellectual property, and local content and advertising requirements, among others;\nexposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK\nBribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws\nrequiring the maintenance of accurate books and records and a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures, including as a result of competition with other devices that consumers\nmay use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by incumbent\nTV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming apps or content to users in certain international\nmarkets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, including due to pandemics,\nnatural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine), tariffs,\ntrade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions (such as the tension between China and\nTaiwan and the tension in the Middle East), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, such as in the event that the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties or the moratorium is applied\nonly among WTO member states that support a new e-commerce agreement;\npandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the use\nof our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such\nservices to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, which may increase costs for materials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange\nRate Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report);\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIn addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our three-phased business model—grow scale, grow\nengagement, and grow monetization—in international markets. Even if we are able to increase our user base in\ninternational markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our Streaming Hours or monetize user activity in those\nmarkets. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality and other potential fluctuations, and if our sales during\nthe affected periods fall below our expectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonality and certain one-time events significantly affect our business. For example, our revenue and gross\nprofit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and\nincreased advertising during holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we\nrecognize significant discounts in the average selling prices of our products through retailers in an effort to\ngrow our user base, which typically reduce our devices gross margin in the fourth quarter. Additionally, certain\nother events have in the past, and may in the future, impact the amount of advertising spending on our platform.\nGiven the seasonal and often irregular nature of advertising and our product sales, as well as other potential\nfluctuations, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations. We anticipate that such impact on revenue and\ngross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in expected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the\neffectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our competitors, reductions in consumer discretionary\nspending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our supply or distribution chains, tariffs or other\nrestrictions on trade, increased shipping costs,\n24\nTable of Contents\nshipping or air freight delays, or for any other reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer\nsignificantly. For example, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the past, and may in the future,\nadversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver products to retailers during\nholiday seasons.\nA substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nbenefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue\nshortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in\nthe short term, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall management,\nas well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our strategic\ndirection. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key personnel. The\nloss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable successor to a key\nrole could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our\nemployees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources\nto identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. To attract top talent,\nwe generally offer competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In\naddition, some companies offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for\nemployees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and\nmay in the future need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition\nand other business and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled\nemployees necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\npast or any additional workforce reductions could harm employee morale and negatively impact employee recruiting\nand retention.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,\nand other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and\nfinancial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content partners, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, licensed Roku TV partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in\nerrors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions involving a number of risks, which could harm our business if not successfully\naddressed.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions may require the expenditure of cash, dilutive issuances of equity securities, or the incurrence of\ndebt, which could adversely affect our operating results, result in unfavorable accounting treatment, and expose us\nto claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims. Acquisitions may not generate\nsufficient financial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions.\nIn addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen\noperating difficulties and expenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies\ninvolve areas of operation in which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products,\nor technologies in international markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of\noperations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and\nregulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at\nall, without incurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address\nsuch risks successfully, our business could be harmed.\nOur credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and\ncontains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or\notherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), by and among us, as borrower,\ncertain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto, and Citibank N.A., as\nadministrative agent (the “Agent”), providing for (i) a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $300.0 million, and (ii) an uncommitted increase option of up to an additional $300.0\nmillion exercisable upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The Credit Agreement provides for a\n$100.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit, and certain existing letters of credit were\ndeemed outstanding under this facility. The Credit Agreement will mature on September 16, 2029. Proceeds from the\nCredit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance working capital requirements. As\nof December 31, 2024, we had not borrowed against the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio\nand a maximum total net leverage ratio, as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which could\nresult in amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement becoming due and payable and remaining commitments terminated\nprior to the initial termination date on September 16, 2029. The Credit Agreement also contains a number of\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, impose restrictions, subject to certain\nexceptions, on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments, asset dispositions, restricted payments,\ndividends and distributions, prepayment of other indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, restrictive\nagreements, amendments of material documents, and the abandonment of intellectual property. The obligations under\nthe Credit Agreement, along with certain swap and banking services obligations, are secured by substantially all\nthe assets of us and our subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, except for certain customary\nexcluded assets.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. However, if we\nfail to comply with the covenants, fail to make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo any other\nevent of default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which would give\nit the right to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings outstanding,\ntogether with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the Agent would\nhave the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If any\nfuture outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to\nsell sufficient assets to repay it, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming\nplatform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the\nhiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic\nconditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur Credit Agreement matures on September 16, 2029. While we may enter into a new credit agreement in the future,\nwe currently have no other committed source of financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on\nterms favorable to us. Any future credit agreements we may enter into could require a lien on our assets or contain\nfinancial covenants and other restrictions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect\nour financial condition. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us\nwhen we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges\ncould be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nWe maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial\ninstitutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.\nWe maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks that exceed the\nFDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not\ninsured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited\nliquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns\nor rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, in 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed\nand was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or\ncredit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity\nand financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable\ninsurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial\ninstitution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government\ninstitutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties can adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties, such as inflation, slow growth or recession, higher interest rates, financial and\ncredit market fluctuations, changes in economic or government policies (such as tariffs), bank failures, labor\ndisputes, and global supply chain constraints have, and may in the future, adversely impact consumer confidence and\nspending and materially adversely affect many aspects of our business.\nOur business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both of which are\nsusceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties. Sustained inflation, an economic downturn, or\nthe impact of tariffs, have in the past and may in the future result in fewer consumer purchases of our products or\nthe products of our licensed Roku TV partners and reduced advertising spending. At times, advertising budgets in a\nvariety of industries have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and market\nuncertainty, which has led to reduced advertiser spending and adversely affected our platform revenue. Any pullback\nin consumer discretionary spending or advertising spending could adversely affect our future operating results.\nIn addition, a significant reduction in the supply of original entertainment content, including as a result of\nmacroeconomic factors or labor disputes (such as the 2023 strikes called by the Writers Guild of America and\nSAG‐AFTRA), could in turn reduce the demand for advertising on our platform, and have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, operating results, and key performance metrics.\nThe extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may impact our operational and financial performance is uncertain\nand will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may negatively affect our\nbusiness and operating results.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and\nimpact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cybersecurity attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the\nRussian invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East), terrorist attack and other geopolitical\nconflicts (such as Yemen’s Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, or potential retaliatory actions from foreign governments\nin response to the current U.S. Administration’s actions), medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19\npandemic), government shutdown orders, other man-made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our,\nour business partners’ and customers’ business operations or result in disruptions in the broader global economic\nenvironment. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to\nfully resume operations.\nIn particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. For\nexample, a recent earthquake damaged equipment in our Taiwan office, and the losses, while relatively minor, were\nnot covered by our insurance.\nIn addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV\npartners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\nwildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,\nincreasing intensity of\n27\nTable of Contents\ndrought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages. Further, acts of\nterrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.\nIf our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,\nour ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the\noperations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or\nother catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed\nRoku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a natural disaster or other catastrophic event and to\nexecute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nData security incidents, including cybersecurity attacks, or other significant disruptions of our information\ntechnology systems could harm our reputation, cause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely\naffect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of\nour business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal, and other\ninformation, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card information, user\nvideo and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential information. It is\ncritical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such\ninformation. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-\ncertifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\npersonal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as\npart of an information security program, and complying with requirements regarding the use or cross-border transfer\nof such personal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our business\npartners, our users, and other stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and potential\nusers. Data protection laws around the world often require “reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and\norganizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws are often uncertain and\nevolving, and there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or\nreasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in\naccordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain.\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies. In\naddition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a data security incident,\nand any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our network infrastructure to\nthe satisfaction of our users, business partners, regulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our\nreputation and our ability to retain existing users and attract new users, as well as adversely affect our business\noperations and result in substantial costs. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our\nbusiness partners, our users, and other stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and\npotential users.\nWe have outsourced or may outsource certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information\ntechnology infrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects,\nprocesses, transmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and\nuser video and audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who\nmay or could have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our\nconfidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their\nresponsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of\nthird parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex. Technology system\ndisruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters,\nterrorism, war, foreign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material\ndisruption of our product development and our business operations. Significant disruptions of our third-party\nvendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could also\nadversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, misappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or\ndisclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or personal information, which could harm our business.\nThe size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the large\namounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to unintentional\nor malicious, internal, and external threats. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we\nmay be a particularly attractive target for threat actors. The risk of harm to our business caused by security\nincidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings and as we enter new markets.\nVulnerabilities can be, and have been, exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-\nparty vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Open-source software, which may be incorporated\ninto our systems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which\nwe are not aware and which we cannot control or\n28\nTable of Contents\nfully mitigate. Moreover, AI technologies may be used to implement certain cybersecurity attacks or to increase\ntheir intensity, which may further increase risk. While we have processes in place to mitigate the risks related to\nthese vulnerabilities, these measures may not be adequately designed or implemented to ensure that our operations\nare not disrupted, our reputation is not harmed, or that we will not be impacted by ransomware, cybersecurity\nattacks, or other vulnerabilities in the future. For example, despite our efforts to secure our information\ntechnology systems and the data contained in those systems, we and our third-party vendors and business partners\nhave experienced, and remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including ransomware, phishing attacks, bot\nattacks, credential stuffing attacks, improper employee access of confidential data, and inadvertent employee\ndisclosure of confidential data. There is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data\nsecurity incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a\ndata security incident that we have not discovered, we note that attackers continue to advance the ways they\nconceal their unauthorized access to systems.\nMalicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication, and intensity, and are\nbeing conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but\nnot limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation\nstates, and others. The geopolitical conflicts stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the current unrest\nin the Middle East have increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations globally,\nincluding for companies headquartered in the United States, that could materially disrupt our systems and\noperations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell, and distribute our devices and services. Any attempts by\nthreat actors to disrupt our streaming platform, streaming devices, smart home products, website, computer systems,\nor mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm\nto our systems and operations, damage our reputation, and could result in contractual damages, litigation,\ngovernmental inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, and regulatory notification requirements, fines,\nand penalties that could harm our business. For example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data,\nwe may be subject to substantial penalties for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security\nrequirements of the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to\nprotect cardholder data. Penalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be\nimposed by various entities within the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally\nmandated framework. Such enforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business\nwith, and our third-party payment processors.\nMost of our employees have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols, the actions of our employees while working from home may\nhave a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of\ncompromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from employees’ combined use of personal and\nprivate devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do not control, or the ability to\ntransmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nThe limitations of liability in our contracts related to our information technology systems may not be enforceable\nor adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. While we maintain insurance policies to cover\ncertain losses relating to our information technology systems, there may be exceptions. Security incidents or\ncertain aspects of security incidents may not be fully covered by our insurance policies or covered at all.\nAdditionally, insurance policies will not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security\nincident. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance\ncoverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large\ndeductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, we cannot be sure\nthat our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, disclose, and store personal information,\nwhich creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, disclose, and store personal information of\nindividuals. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad and may\nstore or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Various federal, state, and\nforeign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations govern the collection,\nprocessing, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, and storage of such personal\ninformation. These regulatory requirements are evolving, and data privacy compliance is an area of increasing\nscrutiny for privacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies. For example, in addition to the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção\nde Dados, various U.S. states have enacted broad-based privacy and data protection legislation, including\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon,\nTexas, Utah, and Virginia, and more states are expected to follow suit.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. We continue to monitor the\nimplementation, enforcement, interpretation, and evolution of these laws and regulations, but they are still\nrapidly evolving and, as a result, their application, interpretation, and enforcement are uncertain, and they may\nbe interpreted and applied inconsistently with our current policies and practices. In such event, we may be subject\nto significant fines and penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) or claims for damages\nfrom private litigants, or we\n29\nTable of Contents\nmay be required to make changes to our policies and operations, including the manner in which we provide our\nservices or use our user data, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe continue to assess the available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions on international\ndata transfer compliance for companies. As part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data\ntransfer mechanisms to provide for the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area or the\nUnited Kingdom to the United States. We have joined the EU, Swiss, and UK Data Privacy Framework programs to\nfacilitate transfers of non-HR personal data to the United States from these jurisdictions. Our ability to continue\nto transfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to\nincreased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience operating\ndisruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future. In addition, some countries are considering\nor have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data regarding users in their respective countries be\nmaintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries. Maintaining local data centers in individual\ncountries could increase our operating costs significantly.\nWe, our service providers and partners use tracking technologies to collect information about users’ interactions\nwith our platform, devices, websites, apps, and partners’ digital properties, and deliver advertising and\npersonalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our partners. To personalize content and advertisements\neffectively, we must leverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. The U.S. federal government,\nU.S. states, and foreign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could\nsignificantly restrict us and other advertising industry participants’ ability to collect, use, retain, and\ndisclose personal information. For example, some of these laws and regulations may require more explicit consumer\nnotice and consent for using tracking technology or collecting sensitive personal information, restrict disclosure\nof personal information between companies, or grant consumers the right to delete or limit the collection and use\nof their personal information. Our ability to collect, use and retain such data could also be further restricted by\nour agreements with advertisers and content partners.\nAny restrictions on our ability to collect, use, or retain data is likely to increase the number of users to whom\nwe cannot serve targeted advertising, which could make our platform less attractive to advertisers and partners,\nand harm our ability to grow our revenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on effective delivery of\nadvertising campaigns. We are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed privacy and data protection laws\non our business.\nAny significant disruption in our information technology systems or those of third parties we utilize in our\noperations could result in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service\nproviders and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku TV OS, streaming platform, smart home\nproducts, and other information technology systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of information technology systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness\nof our products and streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We\nutilize information technology systems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting\nproviders and third-party internet-based or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service\nlevel agreements with these parties, we exercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any\nerrors, interruptions, or delays that they may experience.\nUpon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace\ntheir services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable\nto us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies\nuntil the transition is complete. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist\nactivity, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar events could damage these systems and\nhardware or cause them to fail completely.\nAs we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could\nadversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully\ncover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these\nvendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our information technology systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails,\nit may lead to downtime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We\nexpect to continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and\nplatform performance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address\ncapacity constraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network\narchitecture to accommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual\nand anticipated changes in technology, our business may be harmed.\n30\nTable of Contents\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as well as their continued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected\nnature of the internet. We exercise no control over network operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors,\ndisruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as any decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of\ncertain network traffic at the expense of other traffic. Any material disruption or degradation in internet\nservices could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by\nISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of\nwhich could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide users with access to the internet also offer users multichannel\nvideo programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators have an\nincentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of other\ncompanies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to provide\npreferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our\nproducts and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us and may seek to challenge\nthe validity or enforceability of our own patents and patents applications. The cost of patent litigation or other\nproceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of our competitors may\nbe better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their substantially greater\nfinancial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant management time and\ndivert management’s attention from our other business concerns or otherwise adversely affect our business and\noperating results. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other\nproceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could\nharm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all, thereby hindering our ability to sell or use the relevant technology or requiring redesign of the\nallegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time‐consuming, or impossible. Even if\nwe are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and\nthe rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to gain access to the same\nintellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property licenses may not include\nrights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the scope of the licenses\ngranted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us and our licensees.\nFurthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages\nand attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property; cease making,\nlicensing, using, or importing technologies or products that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties. For example, we have in the past elected\nto develop and implement specific design changes to address potential risks that certain products could otherwise\nbecome subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from patent infringement and other intellectual\nproperty claims brought to the U.S. International Trade Commission. In addition, any lawsuits regarding\nintellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time\nand attention of our management and technical personnel.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.\nHowever, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop\nour intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our\nagreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach\nthat agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to\ndiscover such breaches, and if we do, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot\nguarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that\ncompetitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent\ninformation and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim\nthat a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result\nin substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft, counterfeiting, or unauthorized reverse\nengineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing\nprocesses, data sets, or other sensitive information.\nOur efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a\nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to\nprevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of\nour trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could\nharm our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including\nbusiness decisions about when to file patents and when to maintain trade secrets, will be adequate to protect our\nbusiness. We have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be\ninnovative. There is no guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the\nprotection gained will be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nU.S. patent laws, and the scope of coverage afforded by them, have been subject to significant changes, such as the\nchange to “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in\nthe determination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Foreign patent laws may also continue to develop and significantly impact our ability\nto protect or maintain our intellectual property. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant\nimpact on our ability to protect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our\nbusiness.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Despite the cost and time we spend\nmonitoring, we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be\nharmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In\nparticular, our actions to monitor and enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit\nversions of our products or products bearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace,\nwhich could divert sales from us, tarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products. In some\ncircumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property\nposition or for other business reasons.\n32\nTable of Contents\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open-source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open-source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have\nincorporated open-source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of\ncertain open-source software or compliance with open-source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject\nto similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or our noncompliance\nwith the open-source software license terms.\nAlthough we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open-source software, these processes\nand procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many\nopen-source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or\ntechnology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. Some open‐source\nsoftware is governed by licenses containing conditions that any person who distributes or uses a modification or\nderivative work of software that was subject to an open‐source license make the modified version subject to the\nsame open‐source license. Distributing or using software that is subject to this kind of open‐source license can\nlead to a requirement that certain aspects of our solutions be distributed or made available in source code form.\nIn such event, we could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar\nopen-source software license terms to third parties, including competitors, at low or no cost, to seek licenses\nfrom third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the\nsale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nFurther, use of open‐source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third‐party\ncommercial software, as open‐source licensors generally do not provide warranties, assurances of title,\nperformance, non‐infringement, or controls on the origin of the software. Open‐source software typically lacks\nsupport, and authors of such open‐source software may abandon further development and maintenance. Open‐source\nsoftware may contain security vulnerabilities and other liabilities, and we may be subject to additional security\nrisk by using open‐source software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, but there can be\nno assurance that these processes will alleviate all risks with the open‐source software we incorporate.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract manufacturers,\nand suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to infringe upon\nthe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements, we indemnify our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent or other property infringement based on allegations related to our technology.\nIf a partner were to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to\nsignificant monetary liabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku\nTV partners often involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in\ncircumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the\nclaim does not pertain to our technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually\nlimited.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to various lawsuits and other legal proceedings,\ndisputes, claims, and government inquiries and investigations, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or\nrequire us to change our business practices in a way that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to various lawsuits, stockholder derivative actions,\nclass action lawsuits, individual or mass arbitration proceedings, and other types of legal proceedings, as well as\nother disputes, claims, and regulatory or governmental inquiries and investigations, including with regard to\ncontract or commercial disputes, consumer protection, privacy, data protection, intellectual property, tax,\nemployment, and corporate governance, among other matters. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments or\notherwise fail to comply with our contractual obligations, then we could be subject to breach of contract or other\nclaims. Any claims, proceedings, individual or mass arbitration demands, or inquiries or investigations initiated\nby or against us, whether successful or not, may be time-consuming, subject us to damage awards, regulatory orders,\nconsent decrees, injunctive relief, fines, or other penalties or sanctions, require us to change our policies or\npractices, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us\nto incur significant legal fees, other litigation costs and settlement costs, as well as other expenses. In\naddition, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future\nclaims. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, child and youth protection, data localization, encryption, telecommunications, social media, payment\nprocessing, subscriptions, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet\naccess, net neutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of minors, and\naccessibility, among others. We have been, and may be in the future, subject to claims or governmental or\nregulatory inquiries and investigations with regard to our compliance with such regulations and laws.\nSome of our business activities may be within the scope of existing or proposed laws and regulations intended to\nprotect minors online. In this regard, examples of potentially applicable laws and regulations include the UK Age-\nAppropriate Design Code, UK Online Safety Act, the Irish Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data\nProcessing, various minor-specific provisions of the GDPR and EU Digital Services Act, the Children’s Online\nPrivacy Protection Act, age-appropriate design code style laws at the state level, and minor-specific provisions of\nstate consumer privacy laws. Many states have also incorporated children’s privacy requirements into their laws.\nThis is a rapidly evolving area of law and regulation, and the need to comply with this growing body of laws across\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate could impact our business and require us to incur additional expenses for\ncompliance. Additionally, there have been a dramatic rise in claims asserted under various unsettled laws in the\nUnited States, including the Video Privacy Protection Act, which provides a private right of action and allows for\nstatutory damages, actual damages, and, in certain cases, attorneys’ fees, and other similar U.S. state video\nprivacy laws.\nAs we develop new products and services and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to new technologies that may require us to make changes to our business practices, and failure\nto adequately address or comply with such laws and regulations may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or\nbrand and reputational harm. For example, to the extent that we incorporate generative AI into our products and\nservices, we will be subject to the evolving legal and regulatory landscape surrounding generative AI technologies.\nVarious national and local governments have proposed or enacted measures that impose new and substantial\nobligations related to the use of generative AI systems, including the EU, California, Colorado, and Utah.\nThe laws and regulations governing our industry are still evolving and, as a result, their application,\ninterpretation and enforcement are uncertain, and they may be interpreted and applied inconsistently with our\ncurrent policies and practices. All litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the\nfederal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing such issues continue to develop. See also “— We and our\nservice providers and partners collect, process, disclose, and store personal information, which creates legal\nobligations and exposes us to potential liability .” Regulatory inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions\ncould also adversely impact our business operations. For example, we and other companies in the media,\nentertainment, and advertising technology industries have been subject to government inquiries and investigations\nby regulatory bodies with regard to our compliance with privacy and data security laws, the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and other applicable laws and regulations. Advocacy organizations have also filed complaints with\ndata protection authorities against businesses with streaming apps and advertising technology, arguing that certain\nof these companies’ practices do not comply with applicable law. The potential effects of such inquiries,\ninvestigations, or enforcement actions are far-reaching, uncertain, and difficult to predict, and may require us,\nour partners, and our advertisers to modify data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial\ncompliance costs and expenses. Furthermore, if we or the third parties that we work with are alleged to violate\napplicable laws, our contractual obligations, or our policies, our users could lose trust in us. Any decrease in\nuser retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, advertisers, or partners,\nand would seriously harm our business.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and\nother countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus, and\nthe United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions\nshould the conflict further escalate. In addition, the effects of Brexit on EU-UK political, trade, economic, and\ndiplomatic relations continue to be uncertain and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more.\nContinued uncertainty and friction may result in regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our international\noperations.\nTrade disputes, geopolitical tensions, or political uncertainty can disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of\nour and our partners’ products, and have a negative impact on consumer confidence, which could impair our future\ngrowth and adversely affect our operations, business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example,\nthe current U.S.\n34\nTable of Contents\nAdministration has imposed or threatened to impose a range of new tariffs and trade restrictions affecting U.S.\nimports from China, Canada, Mexico, and other countries. U.S. policymakers have also discussed possible new tariffs\non components or inputs incorporated into finished products imported into the United States. The threat,\nimplementation, or modification of such new import restrictions, as well as any retaliatory measures adopted by\naffected U.S. trade partners, could increase our costs and otherwise be disruptive to the business environment in\nwhich we operate.\nIn addition, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and other countries imposed economic\nsanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus, and the United States and other\ncountries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict further\nescalate. Similarly, the effects of Brexit on EU-UK political, trade, economic, and diplomatic relations continue\nto be uncertain and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more. Continued uncertainty and\nfriction may result in regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our international operations.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and\nsanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within\nour complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries or provided by our\nretailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures, and internal controls relating to such\ncompliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all\ntimes or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our\nretailers or partners. Any such potential violation by us, our retailers, or our partners could have negative\nconsequences, including government inquiries, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary fines, or civil and/or\ncriminal penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.\nThe ability of internet access network operators in some jurisdictions to degrade users’ internet speeds or limit\ninternet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the provision of broadband internet\naccess services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. We believe that the continued\ngrowth of streaming as an entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective\nbroadband internet access (including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband\ncontent delivery, and broadband service providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content\ntraveling on their networks. Laws, regulations, or court rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in\nuse of the internet, including decisions that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, or that\ndisincentivize internet access network operators’ willingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their\nequipment, could decrease customer demand for our service offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could\ncause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations\ngoverning the provision of internet access service. Substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and\nelsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in the United States, a federal appellate court recently\nprevented new FCC “net neutrality” rules and an associated broadband oversight framework from going into effect,\nfinding that the FCC likely does not have statutory authority to adopt such requirements. As a result, there are no\nFCC rules currently in effect that prohibit internet service providers from unreasonably restricting, blocking,\ndegrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content partners.\nIf network operators were to engage in restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede\nour growth, result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise\nimpair our ability to attract and retain users, any of which could harm our business. Several states and foreign\ncountries in which we operate also have adopted or are considering rules governing the provision of internet\naccess. In addition, in some jurisdictions (including the United States), network operators are pursuing proposals\nthat would require or enable them to impose fees on content providers related to delivery of network traffic.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable\n35\nTable of Contents\ndiscrimination are nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we\ncould experience anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or\notherwise harm our business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing\ninterpretations or applications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result\nin additional liabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce\nDirective in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The\nDMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to\nuncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that\nlimit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content\nmoderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit\nour ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of apps that are distributed on our platform.\nWhile our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the\ncopyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in\ncertain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted\ncontent. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our\nability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated.\nAny failure to maintain internal controls over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately\nreport our financial condition or results of operations. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting, are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner,\nare unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent\nregistered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports,\nand the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject\nto investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require\nadditional financial and management resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nThe generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting\nprinciples. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results\nof operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness\nof a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting\npolicies, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees, which could harm our\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\n36\nTable of Contents\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our founder,\nChairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares\nof our outstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and all\nmatters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions,\nsuch as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s employment with us\nis terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31, 2024, Mr.\nWood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only\nowns 12.0% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our\n“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably\nbelieves to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.\nWood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely\nthis concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not\nsupport. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common\nstock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class\nA common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition, operating results, and key performance metrics;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content partners;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nthe perception that our environmental, social, and corporate governance performance is inadequate compared to\nthat of our competitors;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, geopolitical\ntensions, terrorism, or public health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, tariffs, or\ninternational currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a\nresult of such fluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of\nyour investment. In addition, we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their\nstock have been, and may in the future be, subject to securities class action litigation or derivative litigation.\nSuch litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business\nconcerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year, at\nthe end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent workers\nmay also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that\n38\nTable of Contents\ncomply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and\nsubsequently sold, it is dilutive to existing stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could\ndecline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or\nissues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or\nmore equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory\nand governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, which may\nresult in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from\nrevenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new\nlaws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified directors and officers.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our Credit Agreement contains prohibitions on the\npayment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common\nstock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;\npermitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\n39\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business."

Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nOur enterprise-wide approach to risk management is designed to support the achievement of our organizational and\nstrategic objectives and improve long-term organizational performance. Cybersecurity is a critical component of our\nenterprise risk management approach, and cybersecurity risks are among the enterprise risks that are subject to\noversight by our Board and the Audit Committee of our Board (the “Audit Committee”).\nOur cybersecurity program is designed to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Key\ncomponents of our cybersecurity program include:\nmanaging cybersecurity threats by deploying technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information\nsystems from cybersecurity threats, which we evaluate and seek to improve, including through vulnerability\nassessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence;\nmaintaining cybersecurity incident management procedures to address incident reporting, classification,\nescalation, response, and recovery, and facilitate efficient and consistent management of cybersecurity incidents\ninvolving our information systems;\nassessing and testing our cybersecurity policies and practices via internal efforts (such as assessments,\nvulnerability testing, threat modeling, tabletop exercises, and other exercises focused on evaluating the\neffectiveness of our cybersecurity measures) and by engaging third parties(including cybersecurity consulting\nfirms) to perform assessments of our cybersecurity measures and manage our bug bounty program;\n40\nTable of Contents\na cybersecurity risk management process for third-party vendors,including, among other things, a security\nassessment and contracting process for vendor applications and implementing contractual security measures with\nthird-party vendors; and\ncybersecurity awareness training is available for all employees and enhanced training is provided for certain\nemployees.\nCybersecurity Governance\nAs part of its broader risk oversight activities, the Boardoversees risks from cybersecurity threats, primarily\nthrough delegation to the Audit Committee. As reflected in its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in\nreviewing our significant cybersecurity matters and concerns. The Audit Committee engages on cybersecurity matters\nwith our management team, including our Vice President of Product and Enterprise Security, who regularly provides\npresentations to the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity governance and compliance programs. These presentations\naddress a range of topics including, for example, the threat landscape and cybersecurity events, vulnerability\nassessments, incident preparedness assessments, disaster recovery plans, and cybersecurity awareness training. Two\nadditional members of our Board, who have cybersecurity experience but are not members of the Audit Committee, are\ninvited to attend Audit Committee meetings when review of our cybersecurity program is on the agenda. In addition,\nthe full Board receives regular updates on the activities of the Audit Committee, including with regard to\ncybersecurity oversight.\nOur Vice President of Product and Enterprise Security is principally responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity\nrisk management program, in partnership with other members of management. Our Vice President of Product and\nEnterprise Security has over 30 years of experience in cybersecurity and information technology roles, including\nexecutive leadership positions at public and private companies.\nIn addition, our Executive Incident Management Team (“EIMT”) is a cross-functional management committee dedicated\nto providing executive-level guidance on the cybersecurity incident response process to facilitate an appropriate\nand timely response, make decisions related to cybersecurity incidents, and notify appropriate parties with\nrelevant cross-functional expertise in the event of a cybersecurity incident.\nOur Product and Enterprise Security team is responsible for the day-to-day identification, assessment, and\nmanagement of information security risks and provides regular updates to our Vice President of Product and\nEnterprise Security regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.\nCybersecurity incidents are escalated to our Vice President of Product and Enterprise Security, the EIMT, and the\nChair of our Audit Committee in accordance with our cybersecurity incident management procedures, so that decisions\ncan be made regarding incident reporting and disclosure in a timely manner.\nNotwithstanding our cybersecurity risk management and governance, we may not be successful in preventing or\nmitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While our business strategy,\nresults of operations, and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, we cannot provide assurance that\nthey will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more\ninformation regarding the cybersecurity risks we face, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nunder the caption “Data security incidents, including cybersecurity attacks, or other significant disruptions of\nour information technology systems could harm our reputation, cause us to modify our business practices, and\notherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.”"

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2023 and\n2022 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\nfiled with the SEC on February 16, 2024.\nOverview\nOur two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video advertising, ads integrated into our UI,\nand related services) and streaming services distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares,\nthe sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices of\nRoku streaming devices in an effort to sell more devices, which we believe will increase our Streaming Households.\nWe expect that this trade off from devices gross profit or loss to grow Streaming Households should result in\nincreased platform revenue and platform gross profit over time.\nKey Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Measure\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are Streaming Households, Streaming Hours, ARPU, and Free Cash Flow.\nBeginning with our results for the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer report quarterly updates on Streaming\nHouseholds, and by extension, ARPU. Since we first reported our key performance metrics in connection with our\ninitial public offering in 2017, our business and the streaming industry have evolved significantly. Now, we are\nprimarily focused on the growth of revenue of our platform segment and Adjusted earnings before interest, tax,\ndepreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA). As a result, effective as of the first quarter of 2025, our key\nperformance metrics will be Streaming Hours, Platform Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.\nStreaming Households\nWe believe that the number of Streaming Households is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We\ndefine Streaming Households as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform\nwithin the last 30 days of the period. We refer to such accounts as “Streaming Households” because a given user\naccount does not necessarily represent a single viewer or a single Roku streaming device. Rather, a single account\nmay be used by multiple viewers and linked to multiple devices. As a result, we may identify more than one\nStreaming Household within a single dwelling, and more than one dwelling may constitute a Streaming Household.\nUsers who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included in this metric.\nAdditionally, users who only register an account for use of one of our smart home products are not included in our\nreported number of Streaming Households.\nWe had 89.8 million and 80.0 million Streaming Households as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively,\nreflecting an increase of 12%.\nStreaming Hours\nWe believe the number of Streaming Hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define Streaming Hours as the aggregate amount of time Roku streaming\ndevices stream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku\nplatforms are not included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our Streaming\nHours.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content partners is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming apps, and the number of Streaming Hours\ndoes not correlate to revenue earned from such content partners or ARPU on a period-by-period basis. Moreover,\nStreaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming app may\ncontinue to play content for\n44\nTable of Contents\na period of time determined by the streaming app. We believe that this also occurs across a wide variety of non-\nRoku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku TV OS feature that is designed to identify when\ncontent has been continuously streaming on an app for an extended period of time without user interaction. This\nfeature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are\nstill watching the selected app and closes the app if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe that the\nimplementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our customers, content partners, and\nadvertisers. Some of our leading content partners, including Netflix, also have implemented similar features within\ntheir apps. This Roku TV OS feature supplements these app features. This feature has not had and is not expected to\nhave a material impact on our financial performance.\nWe streamed 127.1 billion and 106.0 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nreflecting an increase of 20%.\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing\nfour quarters divided by the average of the number of Streaming Households at the end of the current period and the\nend of the corresponding period in the prior year. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our Streaming\nHouseholds base and the progress of our platform business.\nARPU was $41.49 as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $39.92 as of December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase of 4%\n. The increase in ARPU was driven by platform revenue growth in the United States, partially offset by an\nincreasing share of Streaming Households in international markets where we are currently focused more on scale and\nengagement than monetization.\nFree Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)\nWe use Free Cash Flow as a primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we believe maximizing\nFree Cash Flow helps indicate the financial strength of our business, as well as provide an indication of cash\ngenerated or (used) by the business. Our goal is to continuously increase Free Cash Flow over time. We define Free\nCash Flow as our trailing 12-month (“TTM”) cash flows from operating activities excluding purchases of property and\nequipment and the effects of exchange rates on cash.\nOur Free Cash Flow was $203.2 million and $175.9 million for the TTM periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Free Cash Flow reconciliation excludes purchases of property\nand equipment and effects of exchange rates on cash from the cash flows from operating activities, in each case\nwhere applicable. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful as a supplement in evaluating our ongoing operational\nperformance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. However, this non-GAAP\nfinancial measure has limitations, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP\nfinancial information, such as GAAP cash flows from operating activities. For additional information about cash\nflows from operating activities, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. In addition, Free Cash Flow may not\nbe comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTrailing Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2024       December 31, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating              $                       218,045    $            255,856\nactivities\nLess: Purchases of property and                                      -5,061                 -82,619\nequipment\nAdd/(Less):\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash,                             -9,746                   2,654\ncash equivalents and restricted cash\nFree cash flow (TTM)                        $                       203,238    $            175,891\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls). Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku\nChannel, native display ads throughout the Roku Experience, as well as ad inventory we obtain through our streaming\nservices distribution\n45\nTable of Contents\nagreements with our content partners. To supplement supply, we purchase advertising inventory from our content\npartners, on an as needed basis. To date, we have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nDevices Revenue\nWe generate devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services,\naudio products, and related accessories. We generate most of our devices revenue in the United States. In our\ninternational markets, we primarily sell our devices through wholesale distributors which, in turn, sell to\nretailers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Revenue, Platform\nCost of revenue, platform primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory, content\namortization costs for both licensed and produced content, costs for licensed premium subscriptions, and revenue\nshare payments on licensed content.

Approximately 5% of our cash was\nheld outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign\noperations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue. The primary uses of cash are costs of\nrevenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party\nmanufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses such as personnel-related expenses, consulting\nand professional service expenses, facility expenses, and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases\nof property and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.\nWe have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition\nactivities in the future, including the acquisition of rights to programming and content assets. Though we do not\nexpect to incur expenses for facilities and building related costs at the same level as the last few fiscal years,\nwe will continue to incur expenses on the maintenance of our facilities and purchases of computer systems, and\nother property and equipment, in order to support future growth in our business. These activities may materially\nimpact our liquidity and capital resources.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance, and our undrawn available balance under our Credit\nAgreement (as discussed below), will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and material\ncash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. Our future capital\nrequirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be affected by various risks,\nuncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the\neffects of the current macroeconomic environment. While the current macroeconomic environment has not severely\nimpacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption and volatility in local\neconomies and in capital and credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in\nthe future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we\nraise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and\nalso to restrictive covenants. Additionally, we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on terms that are\nacceptable to us.\nCredit Agreement\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of our\nsubsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto, and with Citibank N.A., as administrative\nagent (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $300.0 million, and (ii) an uncommitted increase option of up to an additional $300.0\nmillion exercisable upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The Credit Agreement provides for a\n$100.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit, and certain existing letters of credit were\ndeemed outstanding under this facility. The Credit Agreement will mature on September 16, 2029. Proceeds from the\nCredit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance working capital requirements.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and our\nsubsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit Agreement. We may prepay, and in certain circumstances, would be\nrequired to prepay, loans under the Credit Agreement without payment of a premium. The Credit Agreement also\ncontains customary representations and warranties, customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial\ncovenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total net leverage ratio, as\nwell as customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in amounts borrowed under the Credit\nAgreement becoming due and payable and remaining commitments terminated prior to its scheduled September 16, 2029\ntermination date.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit secured by the Credit Agreement of $36.4 million as of December 31, 2024. As\nof December 31, 2024, we had not borrowed against the Credit Agreement, and we were in compliance with all of the\ncovenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report for additional details.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2024          2023\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   218,045    $  255,856\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                   -25,061    $  -92,619\nCash flows used in financing activities    $                   -89,203    $  -61,243\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $218.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our net loss of\n$129.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $756.2 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization and write-off of content assets, depreciation and amortization of\nproperty and equipment and intangible assets, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, impairment of assets\nas part of restructuring charges, foreign currency remeasurement losses, and fair value changes of strategic\ninvestments. The negative impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $408.8 million was primarily\ndue to payments made to acquire content, a decrease in accounts payable, payments made for operating leases\nliabilities, an increase in inventory, an increase in other long-term assets, and an increase in prepaid expenses\nand other current assets, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities due to timing of payments and an\nincrease in deferred revenue.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 included purchases of\nproperty and equipment and expenditures related to the expansion of our office facilities of $5.1 million and an\nadditional strategic investment of $20.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to\ntax payments of $96.4 million to net settle equity awards vested during the period and the payment of $2.2 million\nin issuance costs related to our Credit Agreement, offset by $9.4 million received from proceeds from the exercise\nof employee stock options.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nFor a description of our purchase obligations and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12 and Note 9 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, respectively.\nIn addition, we have $4.8 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. We adjust these positions\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. We are\nunable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. Although we believe we have\nadequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these\nmatters will not be materially different.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable\nat the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nJudgment may be required in determining whether products contain multiple distinct performance obligations and\nwhether each should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation\nbased on its relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). Our process for determining SSP requires judgment. For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, we consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending\nupon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. We determine SSP based on prices\ncharged to customers for individual products, taking into consideration other factors, which may include (i)\nhistorical and expected discounting practices, (ii) the size, and volume of transactions, (iii) the geographic\nareas in which our products are sold, and (iv) our overall go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations\nthat are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen arrangements have variable consideration, we utilize the expected value method to estimate the amount expected\nto be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained to\nthe extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not\noccur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment of historical,\ncurrent, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nThe transaction price in some of our arrangements include non-cash consideration. We determine the fair value of\nnon-cash consideration at contract inception by using historical internal and current observable third-party data.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur devices revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price.\nAmortization of Content Assets\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage of such content\nwhich results in accelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Judgment is\nrequired to determine the amortization patterns of our content assets which are monetized as a group. Critical\njudgments include: (i)\n51\nTable of Contents\nthe predominant monetization strategy of content, (ii) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, and\n(iii) the application of historical viewership model and projected decay. These judgments and underlying analysis\nare reviewed regularly and adjusted as needed on a prospective basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets with\nfinite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nto which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances indicate an asset or asset group’s\ncarrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net\ncash flows directly associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group against their\nrespective carrying amounts. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million for operating lease\nright-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $7.0 million for property and equipment related to a decision to\ncease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31,\n2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $131.6 million for operating lease right-of-use assets and an\nimpairment charge of $72.3 million for property and equipment related to a decision to sub-lease and cease the use\nof certain office facilities and related property and equipment. There were no impairments of property and\nequipment or operating lease right-of-use assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 17 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nSignificant judgments and estimates included in the determination of the fair value of the assets were\nidentification of events or changes in circumstances necessitating an impairment assessment, the expected downtime\nprior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and\ndiscount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nOur accounts receivable is stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical\nexperience, promotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual\nresults, the losses or gains could be material.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset\nand liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or\nrefundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifferences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates. The\nmeasurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than\nnot they will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess all available positive\nand negative evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be\nchallenged by tax authorities. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions,\nincluding interest and penalties, we provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be\nmaterially different.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates while taking into account current tax laws to determine the current\nincome tax provision (benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities, and valuation allowance recorded against a\ndeferred tax asset. Changes in tax law, their interpretation, and resolution of tax audits could significantly\nimpact the income taxes provided in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates\nrelative to the amount of deferred income taxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions,\njudgments and estimates mentioned above could cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements are discussed and included in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. They are incorporated herein by reference."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash and cash equivalents. The\nprimary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly\n52\nTable of Contents\nincreasing risk. We believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points on our cash and cash\nequivalents balance would increase or decrease our interest income by approximately $21.6 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related\nto our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances and lease\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of\ncurrent and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not entered into any derivatives or\nother financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the\nfuture.\n53\nTable of Contents"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination of Streaming Services Distribution – Refer to Note 2 to\nthe financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content partners, management is required to\nestimate variable consideration from revenue sharing related to streaming services distribution.\nVariable consideration related to streaming services distribution (“content partner arrangements”) is included in\nthe estimated transaction price based on the expected value for which a significant reversal of revenue is not\nexpected to occur. For streaming services distribution, the estimate of the variable consideration is based on\nmanagement’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted performance of the partner’s applications.\nWe identified the forecasts of variable consideration relating to streaming services distribution as a critical\naudit matter due to the significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration. Such estimates required\na high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\n55\nTable of Contents\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to\nstreaming services distribution.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\n◦ Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\n◦ Analyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for revenue sharing.\n◦ Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for variable consideration for streaming services distribution.\n◦ Tested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\n◦ Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\n◦ Tested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\n◦ We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to partners’ content application\nas well as our observations and inquiries as to the changes within the business and considerations of macro-\neconomic and industry factors.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 14, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\n56\nTable of Contents\nROKU, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and\nprogrammatic video advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls). The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming\nplayers, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products, and related accessories.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Certain prior period amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\namortization and impairment of content assets;\nthe impairment of long-lived assets;\ninventory reserves;\nvaluation of strategic investments (see Note 7);\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 includes foreign currency translation\nadjustments.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and\nliabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at exchange rates in\neffect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue\nand expenses are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Foreign currency gains\nor losses from remeasurement are recorded as Other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The\nCompany recorded a foreign currency loss of $ 6.4million, a loss of $ 1.5million, and a gain of $ 8.2million during\nthe years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company also has some foreign subsidiaries which use local currency as their functional currency. The financial\nstatements of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity.\n63\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposit accounts\nand investments in money market funds.\nThe Company’s restricted cash balance is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and is used to secure outstanding letters of credit related to operating leases for office\nfacilities.\nThe Company maintains its cash, cash equivalent, and restricted cash balances with financial institutions of high\ncredit quality and continuously monitors the amount of exposure to any one institution and diversifies as necessary\nin order to minimize its concentration risk. Such balances often exceed regulated insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consisted of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024          2023          2022\nBeginning balance                    $                     7,808    $    7,417    $    6,015\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   16,502        16,560        19,068\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -17,883       -16,169       -17,666\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     6,427    $    7,808    $    7,417\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024          2023           2022\nBeginning balance                       $                    23,024    $   28,903    $    48,411\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                     179,100        85,178         94,731\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                       -138,757       -91,057       -114,239\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    63,367    $   23,024    $    28,903\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024         2023        2022\nBeginning balance                  $                     2,213    $   3,498    $  2,158\nProvision for doubtful accounts                            790        1,674       2,081\nAdjustments for write-off                               -1,108       -2,959        -741\nEnding balance                     $                     1,895    $   2,213    $  3,498\nCustomers J and B accounted for 12% and 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31,\n2024 . The Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its accounts\nreceivable, net balance as of December 31, 2023.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment at least annually\nduring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill or\n64\nTable of Contents\nindefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes\nin the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate that it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived-intangible asset is less than its carrying value. In performing\nits annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test for impairment or it can\ndirectly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s qualitative assessment, if it is determined that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets is, more likely than not, less than its\ncarrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount\nover its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit. Any excess of an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying amount over its fair value is\nrecorded as an impairment loss.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets\nwith finite lives for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of an asset or asset\ngroup based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with their use and eventual\ndisposition. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess\nof the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill in any of the periods reported.\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge related to abandoned technology assets of $ 7.5million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. There were no impairments of intangible assetsduring the years ended December 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. See Note 17 for additional details.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 22.6million for operating\nlease right-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $ 7.0million for property and equipment related to a decision\nto cease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. During the year ended December\n31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 131.6million for operating lease right-of-use assets and\nan impairment charge of $ 72.3million for property and equipment related to a decision to sub-lease and cease the\nuse of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. There were noimpairments of property and\nequipment or operating lease right-of-use assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 17 for\nadditional details.\nContent Assets\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as Content assets, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. For licensed content, the cost per title is capitalized along with a corresponding liability when the\nlicense period begins, the content is available for streaming and when the fee is determinable. For produced\ncontent, all direct production costs are capitalized. Payment terms for certain licensed content require advanced\npayments which are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage which results in\naccelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Projected usage is mainly based on\nhistorical and projected viewing patterns. Amortization of content assets is included in Cost of revenue, platform\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nContent assets (licensed and produced) are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less than the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether\nthe film group is impaired. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment\ncharges of $ 65.5million related to restructuring. See Note 17 for additional details.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the\npromised goods or services in the contract which may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the\ninception of each arrangement, the Company evaluates the likelihood that the payments will be collected. When\narrangements have variable consideration, the Company utilizes the expected value method to estimate the amount\nexpected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is\nconstrained to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\n65\nTable of Contents\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on prices charged to customers\nfor individual products in consideration with historical and expected discounting practices, the size, and volume\nof transactions, geographic location, and go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations that are not\nroutinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen the Company’s arrangements involve third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the\nprincipal, and reports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this\nassessment, the Company considers if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are\ntransferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment,\ninventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls).\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies or third-party demand\nand supply-side platforms and to content partners for their media and entertainment promotions. Advertising\narrangements include video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions which include multiple\nperformance obligations that are distinct advertising products. For such arrangements, the Company allocates\nrevenue to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company recognizes revenue either\non a gross or net basis for digital advertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the\nprincipal in the revenue generation process or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being\nprimarily responsible to its customers for the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing\npricing. The Company recognizes video and display advertising revenues primarily when the ad is delivered.\nThe Company’s content distribution arrangements within its streaming services distribution activities include cash\nor non-cash consideration. The content distribution arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts\nthat sign up for new services and at the time of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis\nas the Company is deemed to be the agent between content partners and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time\nelapsed basis, by day, as the services are delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration\nis usually in the form of advertising inventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal\nand third-party data.\nThe Company sells Premium Subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded app buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to a\ncontent partner’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nDevices segment:\nThe Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories.\nThe Company sells the majority of its devices in the U.S. through retailers and distributors as well as through the\nCompany’s website. Devices revenue primarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and\nupdates on a when-and-if available basis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified\nupgrades and updates are available to customers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated\nvalue of the\n66\nTable of Contents\nunspecified upgrades and updates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as devices revenue ratably on a time elapsed\nbasis over the estimated economic life of the associated products.\nThe Company’s devices revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in devices revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\ndevices.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term\nand lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nAs the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease\npayments. The Company takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the\nincremental borrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the\nlease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For its office building leases, the Company\nhas elected to apply the practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent for all leases, where applicable. Non-lease components included within the combined component typically\nrepresent common area maintenance and utilities, and are variable payments based on actual costs.\nThe Company also subleases a portion of its available office space in connection with its restructuring efforts.\nThe subleases are each classified as operating, consistent with their head lease classification. The combined lease\nand non-lease components are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases . Lease\npayments are recognized on a straight-line basis beginning after the commencement date of the sublease, and offset\nagainst the related head lease expense within operating expenses.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The Company elected to apply the fair value option on its investment in convertible\npromissory notes and it is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels for excess and obsolete products, based\non its assessment of future demand and market conditions. The Company recognized inventory provisions charged to\nthe Cost of revenue, Devices, of $ 9.5million and $ 1.7million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ending inventory reserve was $ 28.7million and $ 17.7million,\nrespectively.\nIn addition, the Company records a liability for expected losses on firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase\ncommitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers. The Company recorded losses on purchase commitments,\nrecorded in Cost of revenue, Devices, of $ 34.3million and $ 19.7million during the years ended December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The associated liabilities related to the anticipated losses on firm purchase commitments\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between 18months and five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized\nover the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from oneto 11years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized. Software development costs and the related amortization\nexpenses are not material for any of the periods presented.\n67\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of devices revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, and advance payments from advertisers and content partners,\nwhere performance obligations are not yet fulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is\nclassified as a current liability and the remaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses are recognized when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $ 9.7million, $ 3.7million, and\n$ 10.0million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from a weighted average of the historical volatility of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock price and the stock price volatilities of several peer companies which are similar\nin size and/or operational and economic activities.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of the Company’s stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using\nthe enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets on a more\nlikely than not basis, to the amount that is expected to be realized in the future. The Company recognizes tax\nbenefits from uncertain tax positions only if it believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position\nwill be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for\nincome taxes.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn October 1, 2024, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures .

The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets decreased by $ 16.3million and $ 24.7million\nduring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the timing of billing to customers.\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ 4.0million and $ 10.8million during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, due to an increase in subscription revenue related to Premium\nSubscriptions and smart home products, higher devices revenue, and due to the billings in excess of revenue\nrecognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to platform revenue arrangements. Deferred\nrevenue increased by approximately $ 41.4million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to billings\nin excess of revenue recognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to revenue\narrangements.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2023 was $ 102.2million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $ 88.4million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Remaining performance obligations exclude contracts with original expected terms of one year or\nless. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 923.3million as of December\n31, 2024, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 64% over the next 12months and the remainder\nthereafter.\nThe Company recognized $ 18.2million and $ 45.5million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in the\nestimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nCustomer J and Customer I accounted for 10% and 11% of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively .

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities\nmeasured using Level 1 inputs include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid\nexpenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. The Company did not have any Level 2\ninstruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company measured its strategic investment in convertible promissory notes using Level\n3 inputs. The fair value of the strategic investment in convertible promissory notes on the date of purchase was\ndetermined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company recorded an unrealized gain of $ 1.4million and $\n4.3million, and an unrealized loss of $ 0.5million in Other income, net related to the change in the fair value of\nthe strategic investment in convertible promissory notes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe Company classified the strategic investment in convertible promissory notes as Level 3 due to the lack of\nrelevant observable market data over fair value inputs. The fair value of the strategic investment in convertible\npromissory notes was estimated using a scenario-based probability weighted discounted cash flow model. Significant\nassumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and probability weighting of the various redemption scenarios\nthat impact the settlement of the strategic investment in convertible promissory notes.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of $ 22.6million related to\noperating lease right-of-use assets, and $ 7.0million related to property and equipment related to the associated\nleases.\n74\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded total impairment charges of $ 269.4million that\nincluded $ 131.6million of operating lease right-of-use assets impairment, $ 72.3million of property and equipment\nimpairment, and $ 65.5million of content assets impairment related to the Company’s restructuring efforts. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million related to the\nabandonment of future development of certain technology assets.\nThe fair value of the impaired operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment were estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow models, or the income approach, based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs.\nThe significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement\nof future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect\nthe level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows. For the licensed and produced content that was\nremoved from The Roku Channel, the net carrying amount of the content assets was written off. For the abandoned\ntechnology assets, the net carrying amount of the technology assets was written off.\n9. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate. The leases have remaining terms\nranging from less than 1year to 9years and may include options to extend or terminate the lease.

These contingencies are reviewed at\nleast quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel, and other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal\nproceedings can be, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nThe Company is, and may become, subject to various lawsuits, stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits,\nindividual or mass arbitration proceedings, and other types of legal proceedings, as well as other disputes,\nclaims, and regulatory or governmental inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business, relating to\ncommercial, contract, consumer protection, privacy, data protection, intellectual property, tax, employment,\ncorporate governance, and other matters. Although the results of these legal proceedings, disputes, claims, and\ninquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final\noutcome of any matters that it is currently involved in is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on\nits business, financial condition, or results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings,\ndisputes, claims, and inquiries and investigations can have an adverse impact on the Company because of legal fees,\nother litigation costs, and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, reputational harm, and other\nfactors. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not have any loss contingencies\nthat were material.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n13.

Due to\nthis required capitalization of research and development expenses, the Company has recorded U.S. current income tax\nexpense of $ 13.2million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. As of December 31, 2024, the Company analyzed all available objective evidence, both positive and\nnegative, and believes it is more-likely-than-not that some deferred tax assets will not be realizable.\nAccordingly, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.\nAs of each reporting date, the Company considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its\nview of the future realization of deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company\nrecognized a tax benefit of $ 11.1million related to the release of its valuation allowance against certain foreign\ndeferred tax assets, which are expected to be utilized based on future forecasted income.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 61.3million, $ 166.0million, and $\n199.2million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The change in the valuation\nallowance during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is primarily attributable to an increase in\ndeferred tax assets generated through capitalization of section 174 research and development expenses for U.S.\nfederal and conforming state purposes. The Company’s foreign valuation allowance decreased by $ 51.9million and\nincreased by $ 3.5million and $ 2.2million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe change in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in deferred tax assets as a result of the valuation allowance release in the Netherlands. The change in\nthe valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is primarily attributable to an increase\nin net operating losses. The change in valuation allowance for all years is a charge or benefit to income tax\nexpense.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,283.4million and $ 1,380.4million are available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2037, and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2024.\nFor Brazil, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n6.9million, $ 53.4million, and $ 27.7million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable income, if any.\nBrazil and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be\ncarried back one year and carried forward indefinitely.\n81\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 199.7million and $\n174.6million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2030 and 2039, respectively.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 is $ 92.1million of which $ 88.0million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 4.1million is related to international activities.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2024          2023\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              88,548    $   88,028\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        11,743        13,166\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                        —           -54\nGross increase for tax positions of                         4,393           140\nprior years\nGross decrease for tax positions of                       -12,634       -12,689\nprior years\nDecrease relating to settlements with                           —           -43\ntaxing authorities\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              92,050    $   88,548\nof year\nAs of December 31, 2024, $ 3.9million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect\nthe effective tax rate and $ 88.2million would result in an adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding\nadjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change\nsignificantly within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. The Company recorded $ 0.9million and $ 1.0million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and certain\nforeign jurisdictions. All tax years remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits\ninclude questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and\ncompliance with federal, state, and local tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized and distributions are generally exempt as a\nresult of the Tax Act, the Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as\nforeign withholding taxes and state income tax.\n14. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. NoCompany contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nThe Company has defined contribution plans for employees in certain of its international locations. The Company\ncontributed $ 4.1million, $ 3.2million, and $ 2.3million to these plans for the years ended December 31, 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively.\n15. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to calculate net loss per\nshare. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and as otherwise expressly provided\nin the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by applicable law, shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share\nratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are\nthe same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net loss per share, options to purchase common stock and restricted\nstock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the\ntreasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share in the\nperiod of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.\n82\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share as follows (in thousands,\nexcept per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                        2024                    2023                    2022\nNet loss                   $                  -129,386             $  -709,561             $  -498,005\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                  144,630                 141,572                 137,668\noutstanding — basic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per share —       $                     -0.89             $     -5.01             $     -3.62\nbasic and diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because of their anti-dilutive\neffect were 14.4million, 14.0million and 14.4million units of equity awards to purchase common stock granted under\nthe Company’s equity plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n16. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on gross profit for each operating segment. The CODM uses segment gross\nprofit to allocate resources to each segment predominantly in the annual budgeting process. On a quarterly basis,\nthe CODM uses gross profit budget-to-actual variances to evaluate segment performance. For both the Platform and\nDevices reportable segments, Cost of revenue is the significant segment expense that is regularly provided to the\nCODM. The Company uses the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be\ndisaggregated and presented separately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The\nmanagement approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for\nmaking operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance.\nWhile not considered significant segment expenses, the Company has separately disclosed content amortization (refer\nto Note 6) and stock-based compensation expense (refer to Note 11) charged to Cost of revenue, Platform. The\nCompany disclosed charges related to the inventory provision and inventory losses on purchase commitments (refer to\nNote 2) and stock-based compensation expense (refer to Note 11) included within Cost of revenue, Devices.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does\nnot allocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nDescriptions of the Company’s tworeportable segments are as follows:\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue is generated from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls).\nDevices\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories.\n83\nTable of Contents\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024       2023       2022\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer I                                            *      13  %          *\nCustomer J                                        12  %          *          *\nDevices segment revenue\nCustomer A                                        22  %      15  %          *\nCustomer B                                        21  %      15  %      21  %\nCustomer C                                        28  %      41  %      38  %\nCustomer K                                        10  %          *          *\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.\nLong-lived assets, net\nThe following table presents long-lived assets, net, which consist primarily of property and equipment and\noperating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2024          2023\nUnited States      $             401,464    $  497,024\nUnited Kingdom                    92,110       109,315\nOther countries                   24,621        29,661\nTotal              $             518,195    $  636,000\n17.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nherein.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\n86\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 14, 2025\n87\nTable of Contents"
